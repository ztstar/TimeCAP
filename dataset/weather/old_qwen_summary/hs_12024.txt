Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels showed a significant rise during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures climbed, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, warmer daytime air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, signaling changing airflow patterns possibly linked to a developing circulation feature. The combination of rising pressure, warming temperatures, and increasing wind suggests improving atmospheric stability and a likely continuation of dry, clear conditions in the near term.
