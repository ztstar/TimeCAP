Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist, which likely diminished as temperatures rose and humidity declined in the afternoon. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front that brought changing conditions and potential instability. Wind speeds intensified through the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating a change in airflow patterns that may have contributed to the warming trend. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds suggests a shift toward more stable, warmer conditions, though residual moisture and wind variability may still support isolated showers.
