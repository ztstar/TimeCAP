Temperature showed a steady decline throughout the day, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting a high likelihood of precipitation or fog. Air pressure dropped significantly over the period, reaching a low point before a slight recovery, which is often associated with an approaching storm system. Wind speeds increased notably during midday and late evening, with strong gusts from varied directions, including southerly and easterly flows, hinting at dynamic atmospheric conditions. Combined with sustained high humidity and falling pressure, these trends strongly suggest the presence of an active weather front, likely bringing rain or thunderstorms to New York City.
