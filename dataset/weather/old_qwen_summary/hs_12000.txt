Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in the early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, signaling possible atmospheric instability or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, indicating a change in prevailing flow that may have transported moisture or disrupted local stability. The overall pattern points to a transition from a stable, humid nighttime environment to a more dynamic, warming daytime regime, with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
