Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, indicating a transition from dry to more moist conditions followed by drying. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, which may signal a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of cooling, rising humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a developing weather system that could bring fog, drizzle, or light precipitation later in the day.
