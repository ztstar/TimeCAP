Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder day. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the day, suggesting a period of condensation or fog formation followed by drying conditions. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before a sudden drop in the afternoon, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the early morning hours, only to increase again in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transitioning weather pattern, likely bringing a change in conditions—potentially including precipitation or cooler temperatures—later in the day.
