Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of near-saturation humidity, with values consistently near or at 100%, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during early morning hours. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting a stable nocturnal boundary layer with limited thermal mixing. Air pressure exhibited a steady rise through the early to mid-day, peaking midday before declining slightly, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a transitioning weather pattern. Wind speeds remained moderate and relatively consistent, though wind direction displayed frequent shifts, including notable changes from westerly to easterly sectors, hinting at dynamic local circulation or frontal influences. These combined factors suggest a moist, stable environment with potential for prolonged overcast conditions and elevated risk of localized showers or thunderstorms, especially if destabilization occurs later in the day.
