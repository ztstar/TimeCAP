Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels gradually increased throughout the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly in the afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily rose, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which generally correlates with stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently moderate, with a notable increase during the overnight hours and a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then westerly, suggesting a change in upper-level flow. The combination of rising pressure, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to the arrival of a dry, stable air mass, likely bringing clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
