Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and later to the west-southwest, signaling a change in air mass and possible boundary layer adjustments. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds in the late evening, and high humidity may contribute to a stagnant air mass, potentially leading to diminished air quality or localized discomfort during the night.
