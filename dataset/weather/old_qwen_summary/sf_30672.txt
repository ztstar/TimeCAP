Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the formation of fog or low stratus clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A significant drop in wind speed during the early morning gave way to stronger, more consistent winds in the late afternoon and evening, possibly due to a shift in pressure gradients or the influence of offshore flow. Air pressure fluctuated with a notable rise during the early morning, followed by a gradual stabilization, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system or a localized atmospheric adjustment. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more northerly and then southerly patterns suggests changing air mass influences, potentially signaling the onset of a transitional weather phase.
