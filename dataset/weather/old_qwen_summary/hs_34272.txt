Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist, with a significant drop in the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, peaking earlier and decreasing toward the end, which may reflect the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast to east directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could enhance moisture transport. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms later in the day.
