Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both Influenza A and B contributing significantly to the increasing positivity rates. The peak in positivity occurred during the most recent weeks, indicating a high level of community transmission, with Influenza A dominating the surge. A notable decline followed the peak, suggesting the potential onset of a post-peak phase, though positivity rates remain well above seasonal baseline levels. The disproportionate rise in Influenza A compared to Influenza B in the latter half of the period indicates a shift in dominant strain, which may influence vaccine effectiveness and public health response. Continued monitoring is essential to assess the duration of the outbreak and to guide targeted interventions, especially in vulnerable populations.
