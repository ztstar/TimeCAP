Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels dropped significantly in the early hours, reached a low, and then climbed sharply in the mid-to-late afternoon before tapering off, suggesting the arrival of moist air possibly associated with a developing weather system. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early morning, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, which is indicative of a passing frontal system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, with a peak in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to west and eventually northwest, consistent with the influence of a developing storm or pressure gradient. These trends collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
