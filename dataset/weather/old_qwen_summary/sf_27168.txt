Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles and possible fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a slow recovery, indicating the passage of a weather system that may have brought clouds or light precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from consistent easterly flow to variable directions, with stronger gusts in the morning and evening, potentially enhancing coastal mixing and fog dissipation. These dynamics point to a transition period likely associated with a weakening low-pressure system, resulting in variable conditions with lingering cool, damp air and intermittent breezes.
