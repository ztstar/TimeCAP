Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a prolonged period of subfreezing conditions, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold night into a milder day. Humidity remained relatively low during the early and mid-night hours, then increased significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting rising moisture levels that could contribute to fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system associated with stable and clear conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the early hours, with only brief gusts, but increased in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and south, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air. These combined trends point to a shift from a cold, dry, and calm night toward a slightly warmer, more humid, and breezy day, likely leading to improved conditions with reduced frost risk and a possible increase in cloud cover.
