Temperature showed a steady rise over the 24-hour period, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting possible moisture accumulation and potential for fog or mist. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and late evening, with sustained gusts and changing wind directions, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions and possible storm development. The combination of rising temperature, fluctuating humidity, falling pressure, and variable winds points to an evolving weather pattern that could lead to precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
