Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise as the day progressed, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels remained near or at saturation for most of the period, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent plateau followed by a notable increase, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal initially, increased slightly during the early morning, then decreased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to westerly, consistent with a marine layer influence. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal fog pattern, with the potential for clearing later as the high-pressure ridge strengthens and sea breezes diminish.
