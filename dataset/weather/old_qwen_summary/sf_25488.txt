Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, likely driven by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, variable wind patterns, and a weakening pressure system suggests a period of unstable conditions, potentially leading to fog or drizzle later in the day.
