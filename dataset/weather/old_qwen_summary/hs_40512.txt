Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a decline during the night, reaching a minimum around dawn, followed by a recovery in the afternoon—consistent with a passing weather system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast to south-southwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a more dynamic air mass. Combined, these trends point to a transition period with increasing instability, raising the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
