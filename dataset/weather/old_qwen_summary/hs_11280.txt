Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked spike during the early morning hours, indicating possible nocturnal moisture accumulation, followed by a dramatic drop and subsequent resurgence, suggesting intermittent air mass changes. Air pressure exhibited a strong upward trend through midday, peaking in the late afternoon, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning, particularly around dawn, associated with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, likely due to a local frontal influence or boundary layer adjustment. The persistence of high humidity and variable wind patterns amid a strengthening high-pressure dome implies a potential for fog development overnight and the likelihood of a dry, stable day ahead.
