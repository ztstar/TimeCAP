Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising gradually through the day, indicating increasing solar heating and a developing daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and declined significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as air masses shifted or convection intensified. Air pressure steadily decreased, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, pointing to a developing low-pressure system that could bring instability and precipitation later. Wind speeds increased notably over the latter half of the period, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, indicating a change in regional flow that may facilitate moist air advection. These combined signals suggest the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially as the system matures overnight.
