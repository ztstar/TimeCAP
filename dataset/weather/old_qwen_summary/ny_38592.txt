Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. A significant drop in humidity occurred during the early morning, followed by a rise in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible moisture inflow. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were variable, with notable bursts in the early morning and late evening, driven by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with dynamic atmospheric changes. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a potentially unsettled, moist environment to a drier, more stable regime, likely leading to improved visibility and fair weather in the near term.
