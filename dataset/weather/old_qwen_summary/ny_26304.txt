Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front and subsequent recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of saturation, indicating possible precipitation or fog formation, especially during the overnight hours. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a rebound and a sudden dip later in the day, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes consistent with an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased markedly during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the northeast, aligning with the onset of a frontal passage and potentially contributing to cooler conditions. The shift in wind direction from the east and southeast toward the northeast suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing unsettled weather, including possible rain, in the immediate future.
