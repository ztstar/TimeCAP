Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily into the early afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early and late hours, with brief reductions midday, followed by a resurgence, indicating possible fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to improving conditions later in the day. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, peaking in the morning hours before easing, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns collectively point to a transition from coastal fog and cool conditions to clearer, drier air, which may bring more stable and sunnier weather in the coming hours.
