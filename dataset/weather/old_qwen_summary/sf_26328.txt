Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually increasing through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling and daytime warming. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking during the night and early morning, then dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early hours, followed by a sustained rise through the afternoon and evening, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, tapering off through the night before increasing again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to more southerly and easterly, reflecting changing synoptic conditions. These patterns collectively suggest the end of a coastal fog event, with clearing skies and improving conditions likely leading to a warmer, drier afternoon and evening.
