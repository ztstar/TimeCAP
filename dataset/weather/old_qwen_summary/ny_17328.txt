Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, warmer air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low overnight, then intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, consistent with the approach of a mature high-pressure system. This combination of rising pressure, increasing temperatures, and changing wind patterns points to the onset of a dry, stable, and progressively warmer period in New York City.
