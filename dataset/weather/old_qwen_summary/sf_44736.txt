Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced consistently stable atmospheric conditions with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The unchanging wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent, stable airflow pattern, likely influenced by a high-pressure system dominating the region. Minimal variation in humidity and temperature indicates a lack of incoming weather systems, contributing to dry and relatively stable conditions. The constant air pressure further supports the presence of a stable high-pressure regime, which typically brings clear skies and limited precipitation. Overall, the weather remains calm and predictable, with no immediate signs of storms or changing conditions.
