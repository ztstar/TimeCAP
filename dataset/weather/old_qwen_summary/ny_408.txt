Temperature trends indicate a significant overnight cooling followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion that began to break as day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking before declining steadily, which may signal the passage of a moist air mass and potential fog or low clouds during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, hinting at the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that could precede a shift in weather conditions. These combined patterns suggest the city transitioned from a cool, damp, and calm overnight period to a warmer, drier, and breezier afternoon, with potential for unsettled weather later in the day.
