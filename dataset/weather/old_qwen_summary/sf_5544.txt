Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily during the day, suggesting the dissipation of marine layer fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began to rise in the late morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system approaching the region. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm followed by brief bursts, particularly during the afternoon, associated with shifting wind directions from the southeast to the southwest. These patterns point to the presence of a lingering coastal fog layer that has since begun to break up, leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions as the day progressed.
