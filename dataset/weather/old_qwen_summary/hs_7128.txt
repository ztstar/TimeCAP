Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly from midday onward, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and later to the south-southwest, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. These trends collectively point to a developing high-pressure ridge over the region, likely leading to sunny, dry conditions in the near term with minimal precipitation risk.
