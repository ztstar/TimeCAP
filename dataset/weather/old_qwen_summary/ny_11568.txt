Over the past 24 hours, a steady temperature rise was observed, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects the approach of a milder air mass. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to recover, which is characteristic of an approaching or passing weather front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with stronger atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests changing airflow patterns, potentially signaling the end of a moist, unstable period and the onset of clearer, colder conditions.
