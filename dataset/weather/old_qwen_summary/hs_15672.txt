Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout most of the period, particularly during the early to mid-morning, indicating persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere. A steady drop in air pressure over the late night and early morning hours suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the south-southwest, consistent with a developing disturbance. Combined, these trends point to an unstable atmospheric environment that could lead to scattered thunderstorms or heavy rainfall later in the day.
