Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical in the region during this time of year. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with calm conditions prevailing between midnight and dawn, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, likely associated with the development of a coastal breeze. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more northerly in the early hours suggests a change in the flow pattern, potentially signaling the approach or passage of a weather front.
