Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system that may bring instability. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions and variable directions, but increased sharply in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest, possibly signaling the onset of convective activity. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting winds raises the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
