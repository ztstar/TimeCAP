Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels were consistently high in the early morning hours, peaking near 99%, but declined significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the air mass became more stable. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a recovery and fluctuating pattern later in the day, which may signal the passage of a weak frontal boundary or localized instability. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts reaching moderate levels and winds shifting from the southeast to the southwest, hinting at a change in air circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, especially as warm, moist air continues to accumulate in the lower atmosphere.
