Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the nighttime hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to a low-level convergence or shallow frontal influence. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, indicating the approach of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and persisted at elevated levels through the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and then to westerly, consistent with changing circulation patterns around the low-pressure area. These indicators point to the onset of unstable conditions, raising the potential for thunderstorms or showers in the near term, particularly if additional moisture and lift are introduced.
