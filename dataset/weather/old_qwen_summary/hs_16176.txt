Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, indicating the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to fog or low clouds. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the early morning, remaining elevated through midday, which typically signals the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, leading to stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly, suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics possibly linked to a boundary or front. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with potential for improving air quality and clearing skies later in the day.
