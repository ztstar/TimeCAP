Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high overnight, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwest to more southerly, which may signal an influx of warmer, moist air. These combined trends point to an evolving weather pattern, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions or thunderstorms later in the day.
