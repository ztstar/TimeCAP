Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing and fluctuating through the afternoon. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing air mass influences. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds, and stable humidity points to improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures later in the day.
