Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to a damp, muggy feel and likely increased the chance of condensation or fog. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing during the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more variable, with a brief surge in speed and a shift toward westerly and northerly directions in the late evening, indicating possible changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a moist, unstable nocturnal environment toward a drier, more stable daytime regime, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
