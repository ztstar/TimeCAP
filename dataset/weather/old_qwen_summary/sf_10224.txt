Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping sharply and remaining low through early morning before gradually rising. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, consistent with the onset of overcast and potentially damp conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief pause and shift in direction during the early morning, suggesting a weakening of prevailing offshore flow and possible onshore influence. The combination of high humidity, low pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests a high likelihood of persistent fog and cool conditions in the coming hours.
