Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. A significant increase in humidity, reaching near-saturated levels during the night and early morning, indicates the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure rose steadily after midnight, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm and shifts in wind direction, particularly in the late night and early morning, which may have contributed to the stagnation of moisture near the surface. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, likely resulting in foggy mornings and clear, mild afternoons—characteristic of San Francisco’s weather patterns.
