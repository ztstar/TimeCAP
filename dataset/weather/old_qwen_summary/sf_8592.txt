Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp spike during early morning hours, suggesting dense fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature dip and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a rebound, signaling a passing weather front or shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly during the morning and late afternoon, with strong southerly and westerly gusts, likely enhancing coastal upwelling and reinforcing fog persistence. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to ongoing marine layer activity, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, which may continue to influence foggy and cool conditions into the coming hours.
