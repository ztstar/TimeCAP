Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly, indicating a shift from moist marine air to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a notable increase, especially during the night, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds and directions revealed a shift from predominantly southerly and westerly flows to more variable and occasionally stronger southeasterly and southwesterly winds, with a brief but intense gust from the south during the night. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, coastal influence to a more stable, inland-like atmosphere, which may reduce fog frequency and improve visibility in the coming hours.
