Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s marine layer behavior. A significant increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, coinciding with the onset of fog, and remained elevated through midday before declining, reflecting the passage of a stable high-pressure system. Wind direction shifted dramatically around dawn, transitioning from a westerly to a southerly and then easterly flow, likely driven by local topography and pressure gradients, with winds remaining light except for a brief increase in speed later in the day. These conditions collectively point to a classic marine influence with fog development overnight and a gradual clearing trend, which may lead to improved visibility and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
