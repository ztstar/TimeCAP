Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day before tapering slightly in the evening. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, followed by a modest recovery, suggesting the passage of a weak weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass. Combined with shifting wind directions and a drop in humidity, these changes suggest a drying and somewhat unstable atmosphere, which may influence the potential for afternoon or evening showers later in the day.
