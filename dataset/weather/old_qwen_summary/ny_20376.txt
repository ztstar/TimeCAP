Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight, indicating saturated air conditions, which contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A notable decline in air pressure occurred during the night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely brought overcast conditions and reduced visibility. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night and early morning, but a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast in the afternoon suggests the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors point to a transition toward unstable weather, with potential for precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
