Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a period of condensation and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then dropped notably in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, particularly from the southeast and east, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined patterns point to a transition in weather conditions, with the possibility of precipitation or storm activity later in the evening or overnight.
