- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a clear upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting a sustained increase in respiratory specimen testing, likely indicating growing influenza activity. A peak is reached around week 14, followed by a sharp decline over the subsequent 6 weeks, suggesting a post-peak reduction in cases or testing volume. The sustained high levels during the rise phase and the pronounced drop afterward point to a classic seasonal influenza pattern, with implications for healthcare preparedness and resource allocation in the coming weeks.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a sharp upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, peaking dramatically before a pronounced decline in the final six weeks, indicating a sustained and intense influenza A activity followed by a rapid waning. The sustained high levels during the peak weeks suggest widespread community transmission, while the steep drop reflects either a natural decline in circulation or potential impacts from public health interventions. The pattern aligns with a typical seasonal influenza surge, with significant implications for healthcare system preparedness and the timing of future intervention strategies.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trajectory over the initial 14 weeks, suggesting a significant surge in influenza B activity, likely indicating the onset and peak of a seasonal outbreak. A sharp decline is observed in the final six weeks, with values dropping steadily after reaching a high point, reflecting the waning phase of the outbreak. The pattern aligns with typical seasonal influenza dynamics, though the magnitude of the peak and the rapid decline warrant attention for public health preparedness and resource allocation.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting escalating influenza activity, followed by a sharp decline in the subsequent 6 weeks, suggesting the peak of the respiratory season has passed. The rapid descent after the peak indicates a possible waning of circulation, though levels remain elevated compared to earlier in the period, signaling ongoing community transmission. This pattern underscores the importance of continued surveillance and targeted public health measures to mitigate further spread during the residual phase.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting escalating influenza activity reaching a peak before beginning a pronounced decline. A sharp reversal in trajectory occurs in the final six weeks, with a consistent and significant drop in positivity rates, suggesting the peak of the respiratory season may have passed. This pattern indicates a typical seasonal influenza curve, with potential implications for healthcare resource planning and public health messaging as activity returns toward baseline levels.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half, indicating increasing prevalence of influenza B in respiratory specimens. A notable plateau and slight fluctuation in the final weeks suggest possible stabilization or early decline, though levels remain significantly elevated compared to earlier periods. The trajectory points to a robust influenza B season, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the urgency for public health interventions.
