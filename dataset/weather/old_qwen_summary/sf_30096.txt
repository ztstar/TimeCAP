Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture accumulation typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure exhibited a pattern of moderate fluctuation, with a pronounced spike in the early hours, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system or a local atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to a more northerly flow, consistent with changing synoptic patterns and potential upslope or offshore influences. These combined factors point to a transition period in the weather, likely involving fog dissipation and increasing daytime warmth, which could impact visibility, outdoor activities, and local air quality.
