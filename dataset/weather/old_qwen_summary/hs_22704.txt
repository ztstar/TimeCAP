Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for more unstable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then declined significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increasing wind and mixing in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, with a notable drop in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the east-southeast, consistent with the inflow of moist air ahead of a developing weather front. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increased risk of thunderstorms later in the day due to rising instability, moisture, and dynamic forcing.
