Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly around dawn. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction during the late night and early morning, suggesting a change in air mass or frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, clearer skies and more stable air, setting the stage for a mild and pleasant day ahead.
