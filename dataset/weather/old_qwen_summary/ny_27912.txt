Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight period, suggesting moisture-laden air associated with the front, which likely contributed to fog or light precipitation. A notable decrease in air pressure was observed mid-morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and increasing wind speeds, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system. The sustained wind from the southwest and south later in the day suggests continued instability and potential for continued cloud cover or light showers. Overall, the data points to a dynamic transition from cold, humid conditions to a more moderate but unsettled weather regime, with implications for travel and outdoor activities.
