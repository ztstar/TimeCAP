Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the nighttime hours, reaching a peak in the early morning, which suggests increasing moisture content in the air, potentially indicating the approach of a more stable or possibly precipitating air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline in the late afternoon, reflecting a transition from high-pressure dominance to a weakening system. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to stronger and more directional later, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in speed and a shift toward more westerly and northerly directions. These combined trends suggest a weakening high-pressure system and the potential for changing weather conditions, including possible cloud development or precipitation in the near term.
