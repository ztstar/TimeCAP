Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the day, which suggests moisture accumulation during cooler periods and subsequent mixing as temperatures increased. A gradual decrease in air pressure, particularly during the late night and early morning, was observed, culminating in a sharp drop that may signal the approach of a weather system or change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained minimal through the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and southeasterly, potentially indicating an evolving synoptic pattern. These combined trends point to a transition phase in Houston’s weather, possibly setting the stage for increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
