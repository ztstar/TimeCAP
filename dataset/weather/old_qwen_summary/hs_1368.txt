Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, particularly during overnight hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to a muggy feel. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings more stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with strong gusts in the early morning hours followed by a shift to more moderate and variable winds later in the day, accompanied by a dramatic change in wind direction from southerly to northerly. The combination of cooling temperatures, elevated humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward drier and more stable weather, potentially reducing the likelihood of convective activity in the near term.
