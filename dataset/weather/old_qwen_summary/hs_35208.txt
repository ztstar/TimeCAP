Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability, which then declined sharply during the afternoon, consistent with daytime heating and reduced relative humidity. Air pressure steadily increased through the night into the morning, peaking in the midday, which typically signals the approach or presence of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speed remained moderate throughout the day, with a consistent shift in wind direction from north-northeast to east-southeast, hinting at changing local circulation patterns possibly linked to a weakening sea breeze or synoptic-scale flow. Overall, the data points to a transition from cooler, more humid overnight conditions to warmer, drier, and stable afternoon weather, typical of a developing high-pressure regime that suppresses storm development.
