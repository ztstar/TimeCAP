Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend likely associated with a passing frontal system. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, which suggests the arrival of drier air as the system moved through. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west to northwest, contributing to a noticeable cooling effect and potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly component points to a change in air mass, likely bringing fresher, cooler air into the region and marking a transition to more stable conditions.
