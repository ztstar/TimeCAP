Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in multiple periods, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and mist, particularly during the early morning hours. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before slowly declining, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially signaling the approach of a moisture-laden air mass. These combined conditions point to a transition period where lingering nocturnal moisture and increasing daytime heating could elevate the risk of isolated afternoon thunderstorms.
