Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. A sharp increase in humidity, peaking at saturation levels, coincided with the coldest temperatures, indicating the presence of fog or low-lying clouds, likely contributing to reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest a transition from stable to more dynamic weather conditions, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler, windier conditions in the near term.
