Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking during the early hours before declining in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a shallow moisture layer that may have contributed to condensation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late night and early morning, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in air mass. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast, indicating a change in circulation that could enhance moisture transport. The combination of rising temperatures, moderate to high humidity, and increasing wind speeds in the afternoon raises the potential for isolated thunderstorms, particularly during the evening hours.
