Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a cool night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to nighttime cooling. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the early hours and a sustained low afterward, which may signal the approach of a frontal system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast and back, reflecting changing air flow patterns possibly associated with a developing weather front. Combined, these trends suggest the city is experiencing a transition period, potentially leading to overcast conditions or precipitation later in the day.
