Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal warming trend. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, then declined sharply during the day, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture content. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the late afternoon, reaching a peak before gradually declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with coastal flow dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, warmer regime, likely resulting in improved visibility and clearer skies later in the day.
