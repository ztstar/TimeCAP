Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and remained strong through the night, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, suggesting a change in air mass. These conditions point to the arrival of a developing weather system, potentially bringing overcast skies, fog, or light precipitation in the near term.
