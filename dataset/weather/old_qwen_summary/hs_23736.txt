Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures steadily increasing, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, indicating a saturated air mass that contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a generally rising pattern, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with consistent southerly to southeasterly flow, reinforcing the transport of moist air into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, persistent high humidity, and stable pressure suggests a high likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms developing later today, especially as daytime heating intensifies.
