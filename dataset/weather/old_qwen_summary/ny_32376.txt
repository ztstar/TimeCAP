Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern typical of a transitioning weather system. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before falling sharply during midday, suggesting a drying trend associated with a change in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a consistent decline through the night, reaching a minimum around midday, followed by a slow recovery, which points to the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west and southwest, indicating the influence of a developing or passing frontal boundary. These combined patterns suggest that New York City experienced a transition from cooler, humid conditions to drier, breezier weather, likely signaling the end of a stormy period and the approach of a more stable high-pressure regime.
