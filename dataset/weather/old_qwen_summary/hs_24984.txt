Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation for several hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, especially in the early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decline toward the end of the cycle, suggesting no major storm systems are currently affecting the region. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing local circulation patterns, possibly linked to a developing sea breeze. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and increasing afternoon winds suggests a potential for unstable conditions later in the day, raising the possibility of localized showers or thunderstorms.
