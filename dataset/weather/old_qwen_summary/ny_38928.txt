Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise, indicating a cooling trend followed by a slow warming phase likely due to overnight radiative cooling and morning solar input. Humidity levels remained relatively low throughout most of the period, with a sharp spike to near saturation just before dawn, suggesting possible fog formation or condensation as temperatures dropped to near dew point. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, especially during the early morning hours, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in and stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds fluctuated, with peak gusts in the late night and early morning, accompanied by variable wind directions pointing toward a shift in airflow, potentially signaling the arrival of a changing weather front. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity after dawn, and weakening winds suggests improving conditions with clearer skies likely developing in the coming hours.
