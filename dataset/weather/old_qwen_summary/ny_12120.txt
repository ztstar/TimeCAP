Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City dropped significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels remained stable through the night, then surged dramatically in the late morning and early afternoon, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably in the afternoon, with a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction, likely due to the developing low-pressure area, which may have contributed to gusty conditions. These combined indicators point to an evolving weather system that could result in rain or storms later in the evening or overnight.
