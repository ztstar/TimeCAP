Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature followed by a gradual回升, indicating a cooling trend that stabilized overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly throughout the night, reaching saturation and remaining near maximum, which enhances the perception of mugginess and suggests a high potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions, though current humidity levels may limit its drying effect. Wind speeds remained relatively low during the night, increasing slightly in the early morning hours, with wind direction shifting from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly, indicating a change in circulation pattern. These conditions together suggest a transition toward more stable but still humid weather, with little immediate threat of precipitation, though the saturated air may support localized fog or mist as temperatures remain near dew point.
