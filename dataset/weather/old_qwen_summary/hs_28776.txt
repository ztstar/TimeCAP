Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend toward the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a moist air mass persisting over the region. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the overnight period, reaching a low before rebounding in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, suggesting changing flow patterns possibly associated with a developing system. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for unstable conditions and possible precipitation later in the day.
