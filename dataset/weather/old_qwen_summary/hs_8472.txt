Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a possible nocturnal cooling event likely associated with precipitation. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, with near-saturation levels during the night and early morning, suggesting conditions favorable for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp rise in the late afternoon, followed by a sustained decline, which may signal the approach of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally low but increased significantly in the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest that Houston likely underwent a period of precipitation, followed by clearing skies and the potential for unstable conditions later, increasing the risk of thunderstorms.
