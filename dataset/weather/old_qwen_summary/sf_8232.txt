Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking near saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or low stratus clouds, which is typical for the city’s microclimate during nighttime. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a pronounced increase in the early morning hours followed by a sharp decline, indicating a passing weather front. Wind activity intensified in the late evening and overnight, with sustained gusts and shifting directions, pointing to dynamic atmospheric conditions and possible frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the weather, likely bringing overcast skies, lingering fog, and a potential for light drizzle as the system moves through.
