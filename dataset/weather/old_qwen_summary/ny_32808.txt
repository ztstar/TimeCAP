Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity remained elevated during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as surface heating intensified. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with potential for clearer skies and cooler conditions later in the day.
