Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual回升 in the morning, indicating a pronounced cooling trend likely tied to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal activity, but slight drops near dawn may hint at subtle atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, particularly from the southeast and east, which could have facilitated moisture transport and contributed to the high humidity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly during the day may indicate the influence of a developing surface high or a changing pressure gradient, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
