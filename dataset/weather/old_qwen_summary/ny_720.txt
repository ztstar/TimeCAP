Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a cool night with a slow warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting relatively high, dropping sharply during midday, then rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting a passing influence of a dry air mass followed by re-moistening. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late afternoon, with consistent southerly to westerly flows, likely contributing to the mixing of air and the transport of moisture. Together, these trends point to a transitioning weather pattern, with cooling temperatures and increasing stability, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies in the coming hours.
