Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a nighttime cooling phase followed by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking near dawn before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, followed by a sharp rise midday, which is consistent with the approach of a strong high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds diminished through the night, reaching a lull in the early morning before modestly increasing again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southeasterly, hinting at changing air flow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, humid period to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to clear skies and mild conditions in the coming hours.
