Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the overnight hours but intensified in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass and possible storm development. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and a shift in wind direction points to the possibility of improving weather conditions, though lingering moisture may contribute to overcast skies or light precipitation.
