Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then gradually decreased in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, potentially signaling a shift in airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and increasing winds suggests a heightened potential for afternoon or evening thunderstorms later in the day.
