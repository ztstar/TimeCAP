Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating an approaching low-pressure system that may bring instability and precipitation later. Wind speeds remained generally low until late evening, when they increased, consistent with the influence of a developing weather front. Wind direction shifted notably around the midnight timeframe, suggesting a change in air mass, possibly from a southerly to a more easterly flow, which could enhance moisture transport into the region.
