Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through midday before dropping slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or marine layer development. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours before stabilizing, which is indicative of a high-pressure system establishing dominance and promoting stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early night, increased notably in the early morning, and remained moderate through the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly, reflecting changing flow patterns across the Bay Area. These patterns point to a typical coastal weather regime, where nighttime cooling, fog formation, and offshore winds are common, with potential for improving visibility and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
