Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced pattern, peaking in the early hours and then sharply declining, suggesting a drying air mass following a period of moisture buildup. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a peak before beginning to fall slightly, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in direction from northerly to westerly and southerly sectors, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a cold front passing through, leading to clearer skies and cooler, drier air, which may persist into the coming day.
