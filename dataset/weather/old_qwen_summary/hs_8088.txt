Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring instability. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near saturated conditions, which contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel and increased potential for thunderstorm development. Temperature trends showed a steady increase through the day, reaching a high mid-afternoon, followed by a gradual decline, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by strong daytime heating. Wind patterns shifted dramatically in the late afternoon, with a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction from southerly to westerly and then to southeasterly, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system or frontal boundary. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds—point to an elevated risk of scattered thunderstorms, particularly in the evening and overnight hours.
