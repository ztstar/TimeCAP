Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained high in the early hours, peaking overnight before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist marine conditions to drier, clearer air. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and sunny weather. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and gradually decreased, shifting from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy coastal period to a drier, more stable, and potentially sunny afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
