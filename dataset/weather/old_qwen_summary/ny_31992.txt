Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late night, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought cloudy or unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts and shifting directions, including a shift from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating dynamic air flow changes. These combined patterns suggest a transition period influenced by a passing frontal system, raising the possibility of scattered showers or overcast skies in the near term.
