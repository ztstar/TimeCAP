Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a cold front's influence. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, increasing significantly in the afternoon, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to warming air and possible air mass changes. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, peaking midday before declining slightly, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure trough. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, decreasing through the day and then increasing again in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in dominant airflow. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather, with potential for increased cloud cover and precipitation later in the day as a frontal system moves in.
