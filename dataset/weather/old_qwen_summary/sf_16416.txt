Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a sustained drop in the latter half of the period, suggesting the influence of a developing or passing weather system. Wind speeds remained mostly light, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow that intensified slightly in the final hours, possibly indicating a shift in local wind patterns. The overall trend points to a cool, damp, and stable maritime influence, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal weather regime, with conditions conducive to fog and limited sunshine, particularly during the overnight hours.
