Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of marine influence and potential fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with stronger gusts in the morning and late night, primarily from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal wind patterns. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the early morning may have contributed to the higher humidity and cooler temperatures, reinforcing the city’s characteristic microclimatic variability.
