Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting stable moisture levels and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a significant increase after midnight, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated notably during the early hours, with a strong burst in the early morning followed by a marked decrease, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.
