Over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a noticeable warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours before steadily declining, indicating a shift toward drier air conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then showed a steady increase, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent during the night, weakening significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to northerly, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These trends collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable air mass to a drier, more stable environment, likely resulting in improved visibility and clearer skies by morning.
