Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady temperature rise, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of saturation followed by notable drops, suggesting the passage of moisture-laden air masses and subsequent drying. A consistent decline in air pressure was observed throughout the day, culminating in a sustained low-pressure system, which is a key indicator of potential storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that point to a change in air mass, likely from the southwest and later from the west and northwest. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a frontal system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially unsettled weather in the near term.
