Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of widespread fog or low cloud cover, likely contributing to the temperature suppression. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend toward the end of the period, hinting at the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south, aligning with a shift in synoptic conditions that may bring moisture and instability. These combined factors—high humidity, weakening pressure, and strengthening winds—point to a heightened likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the evening or overnight.
