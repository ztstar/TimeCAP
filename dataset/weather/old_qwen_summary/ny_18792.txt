Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and changing air masses. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the day, reaching a low in the mid-afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting a transition from dry to more moist conditions, possibly due to increased moisture advection. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline, especially during the midday to early evening hours, followed by a brief recovery, which is consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased markedly during the afternoon and evening, peaking around mid-evening, with winds shifting from the southeast to the southwest, indicating a change in circulation associated with the approaching system. These combined patterns suggest that New York City experienced a transition from stable, cooler conditions to a more dynamic and potentially stormy weather regime, with a higher likelihood of precipitation later in the night.
