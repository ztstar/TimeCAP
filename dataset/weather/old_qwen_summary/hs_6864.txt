Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a sharp decline, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure increased sharply during the early morning, remaining elevated into the late morning, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system influencing the region and promoting stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the day, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more easterly flow in the early morning, reflecting changing circulation patterns likely associated with a cold front. These combined trends point to the passage of a cold front through the area, leading to cooler, drier air and potentially clearing skies in the coming hours.
