Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late night and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation, possibly due to dew formation or nearby shallow moisture influx. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system building over the region, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a consistent shift toward easterly and northeasterly directions, hinting at a developing synoptic-scale flow that may influence local convection. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and residual moisture suggests a transition toward more stable daytime conditions, with potential for limited convective activity if daytime heating intensifies.
