Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A significant drop in air pressure occurred overnight, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which coincided with a marked increase in humidity and the onset of foggy conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable reduction during the early morning hours, followed by a steady increase in the afternoon, likely due to strengthening sea breezes. Wind direction shifted dramatically from easterly to southerly and then to westerly, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching or passing frontal system. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by maritime influence, potential for fog, and unstable atmospheric conditions that could lead to variable weather later in the day.
