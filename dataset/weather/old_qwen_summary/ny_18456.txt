Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak in the early afternoon before slightly declining, which is consistent with the influence of a strong high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwesterly to southeasterly, hinting at changing circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a stable, dry, and relatively clear weather regime developing, with the potential for comfortable conditions during the day and cooler nights.
