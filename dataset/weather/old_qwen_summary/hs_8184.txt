Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating a saturated air mass, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level cloud cover and reduced visibility. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp rise, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought temporary instability. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds in the late afternoon, coinciding with changes in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly. These combined factors point to the influence of a passing frontal system, likely bringing the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
