Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime heating. Humidity levels surged during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting the release of moisture into the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, with a notable dip just before midday, which may signal the approach of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds increased gradually throughout the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with a developing low-pressure system. These trends collectively suggest a dynamic weather pattern, potentially leading to unstable conditions and an increased risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
