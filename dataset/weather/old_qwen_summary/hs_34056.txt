Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then increased steadily in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the late night and early morning, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds in the afternoon and evening, likely due to changing pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction—from southerly to easterly and then northerly—reflects evolving atmospheric dynamics, possibly indicating the influence of a passing frontal boundary or local convective activity.
