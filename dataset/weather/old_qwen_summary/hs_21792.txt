Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually increasing during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning a slow decline, indicating a moistening of the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase in the early morning followed by minor fluctuations, suggesting a weak high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts intensifying from the southwest, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather system. Combined with the shift in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly sectors, these changes may indicate the onset of a warm, moist air mass, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
