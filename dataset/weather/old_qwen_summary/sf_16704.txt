Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of cool temperatures, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels reached saturation in the middle of the night and remained near 100% for over 10 consecutive hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation and persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light, with minimal variation, though a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow was observed, contributing to the transport of maritime air and enhancing coastal fog development. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer event, characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, which can lead to cool, damp mornings and limited visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
