Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting increasing solar heating and potential clearing skies. Humidity levels showed a cyclical pattern, alternating between high and low values, which may indicate intermittent fog or marine layer movement, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that could bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly toward the end of the period, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air flow dynamics, possibly due to local topography or synoptic influences. These combined factors point to a transition from a cooler, foggy morning to a warmer, windier evening, consistent with typical diurnal coastal weather patterns in San Francisco.
