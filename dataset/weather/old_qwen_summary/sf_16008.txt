Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a steady warming phase, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching saturation and contributing to dense fog that likely reduced visibility and created a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the early hours, peaking midday before declining, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and morning, with strong easterly and southerly winds during peak humidity, likely due to coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale flow. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and then southeast in the evening hints at a changing atmospheric pattern, potentially signaling a shift toward more unsettled or marine-influenced conditions.
