- Humidity (%): Humidity levels remained near saturation for the majority of the past 24 hours, indicating persistent moisture-laden air conditions typical of a stable, high-humidity environment. A notable dip occurred in the latter half of the period, with values declining significantly before stabilizing at moderately high levels, suggesting possible atmospheric changes such as a shift in air mass or localized ventilation. The sustained high humidity throughout most of the timeframe implies a strong potential for discomfort, reduced heat dissipation, and increased risk of mold or mildew development, particularly if temperatures remain elevated.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a sustained upward trend over the past 24 hours, transitioning from a stable baseline to a significantly elevated plateau. The data reveals a clear shift around the 12-hour mark, followed by consistent high readings, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system dominating the region. This pattern suggests stable, fair weather conditions are likely prevailing, with reduced chances of precipitation or atmospheric instability.
- Temperature (Kelvin): Temperature has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 24 hours, beginning with a slight dip before steadily increasing, indicating a clear warming pattern. The rate of increase accelerated in the latter half of the period, with the highest values recorded in the final few hours, suggesting a significant thermal buildup. This progressive rise may reflect diurnal heating or an influence from external weather systems, potentially signaling a shift toward warmer conditions with implications for urban heat stress and energy demand.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a consistent baseline with frequent periods of calm, indicating prolonged intervals of minimal wind activity throughout the 24-hour period. Notable fluctuations occurred mid-cycle, including a sharp drop to zero followed by a return to moderate levels, suggesting transient atmospheric stability or localized wind suppression events. The repeated occurrences of zero wind values, particularly in clusters, imply potential stagnation in air movement, which may influence air quality and thermal comfort in urban areas.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited significant variability over the past 24 hours, with frequent shifts between easterly to northeasterly and southerly to westerly sectors, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions. A notable shift occurred around the 13th hour, transitioning from predominantly easterly flows to a sustained period of southerly and southwesterly winds, suggesting a possible change in pressure systems or frontal influence. The prolonged presence of near-zero degrees (due north) in the latter half of the period may reflect a temporary stagnation or a localized wind alignment, potentially influencing local dispersion patterns.
