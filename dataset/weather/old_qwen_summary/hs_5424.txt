Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more variable patterns, consistent with changing frontal influences. Combined, these trends point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially setting the stage for thunderstorms or heavy showers in the coming hours.
