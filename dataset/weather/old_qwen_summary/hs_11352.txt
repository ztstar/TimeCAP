Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a rapid rise in temperature followed by a stabilization, indicating the onset of a warm period. Humidity levels remained consistently high after an initial drop, suggesting the air became saturated, which may contribute to muggy conditions. Air pressure increased and held steady, reflecting the presence of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings calm and clear weather. Wind speeds were minimal throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from near-northwest to northeast, indicating a change in local air flow patterns. Together, these indicators suggest a stable, warm, and humid environment with little chance of precipitation or storm development in the immediate forecast.
