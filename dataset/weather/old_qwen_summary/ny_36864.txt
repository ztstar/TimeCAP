Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a significant overnight cooling phase. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the day, suggesting a possible increase in moisture availability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reaching a peak in the early morning and remaining high, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing significantly in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from predominantly west to southwest and later to south and southeast, reflecting changing airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a stable, dry, and cool weather regime with limited precipitation potential, though the late-day shift in wind direction may signal the approach of a changing air mass.
