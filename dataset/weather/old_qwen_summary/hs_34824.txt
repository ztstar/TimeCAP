Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn and early morning period, peaking near midday before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that was later displaced. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night and early morning, stabilizing midday before a slight drop, which may reflect the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increased in the afternoon, and shifted direction from southerly to southeasterly, then to a more variable pattern, indicating changing synoptic conditions. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the day transitions into evening.
