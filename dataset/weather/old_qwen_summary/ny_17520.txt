Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily during the afternoon and early evening before cooling slightly overnight. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase in the early morning hours, followed by a sharp decline during midday, indicating a possible shift in air mass or clearing weather. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon and then slightly decreasing, signaling a weakening high-pressure system that may allow for changing conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with stronger gusts in the morning and late afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift toward northeasterly and easterly directions, suggesting a change in local wind patterns. These trends point to a transition period in the weather, with potential for improving conditions later in the day, though lingering moisture could lead to isolated showers.
