Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly in the late afternoon, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions persisting until mid-morning, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, likely due to coastal breezes. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the afternoon hints at the development of a sea breeze, which could further influence local temperature and fog patterns.
