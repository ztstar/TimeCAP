Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the late evening, suggesting the potential approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then more variable, hinting at changing wind patterns possibly linked to a frontal boundary. Together, these indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and shifting winds potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms or unstable conditions later in the day.
