Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a steady warming through the day, indicating a transition from a cool night to a progressively warmer afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of stable, moist air that may have contributed to fog or low visibility in the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight before gradually increasing through the morning and peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings fair and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, increasing steadily through the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating a change in airflow associated with the evolving pressure system. These combined trends suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of improving weather, with clearer skies and drier air likely to follow in the coming hours.
