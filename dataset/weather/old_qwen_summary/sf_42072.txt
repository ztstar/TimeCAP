Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. A significant shift in humidity occurred around dawn, with a sharp rise likely due to fog formation, which persisted through mid-morning before declining as the sun rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating steady atmospheric conditions, though a slight drop coincided with the onset of increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a notable surge in the early hours and another spike in the late evening, suggesting changing local wind patterns. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly and northwesterly during the night to more southerly and easterly in the morning, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the influence of nearby coastal dynamics.
