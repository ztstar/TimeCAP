Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable nighttime period to a warming trend. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation and remaining high, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, likely due to radiational cooling and moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night, stabilizing at a high level, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to stronger and more consistent from midday onward, particularly from the southwest and west, suggesting the onset of a more dynamic flow aloft. These combined factors point to a transition from a damp, cool overnight period to a clearer, warmer, and breezier day ahead, with reduced precipitation risk but potential for gusty conditions later in the day.
