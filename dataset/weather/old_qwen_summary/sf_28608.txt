Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant overnight cooling phase likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with periods of very high saturation—especially during the early morning—suggesting fog formation and potential low cloud cover, which would have reduced visibility and contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp decline followed by a rebound, signaling the passage of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure front, which may have triggered the observed wind shifts and moisture influx. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, particularly from the southeast and east sectors, consistent with onshore flow and the influence of a coastal trough, potentially enhancing fog dispersal and mixing in the lower atmosphere. The combination of high humidity, variable pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to an active coastal meteorological regime, with implications for localized fog, variable visibility, and potentially unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
