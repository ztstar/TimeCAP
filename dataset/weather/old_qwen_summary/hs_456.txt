Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours. A gradual drop in air pressure throughout the night indicated the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal until late night and early morning, then increased steadily, suggesting a developing circulation pattern that could bring precipitation. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly aligns with the movement of a frontal system, potentially signaling the onset of rain or thunderstorms in the coming hours.
