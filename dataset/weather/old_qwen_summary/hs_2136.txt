Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night before sharply declining, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the early and late hours, with a notable lull during the predawn hours, while wind direction shifted from northerly to more southerly, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These trends collectively point to a drying, stable air mass settling over the region, likely leading to improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
