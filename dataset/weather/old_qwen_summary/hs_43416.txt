Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, indicating a shift in air mass that may have brought drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, particularly during the late morning and midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, which could signal the influence of a developing surface front. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable night into a drier, more variable day, with potential for changing conditions later in the forecast period.
