Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising into the day, indicating a cooler overnight period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and steadily declined through the day, suggesting increasing atmospheric stability as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which is often associated with improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the midday and early evening, with a shift toward more northerly and westerly wind directions, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Together, these indicators suggest the onset of a drier, more stable, and gradually warming weather pattern, likely bringing clearer skies and improved conditions for outdoor activities in New York City.
