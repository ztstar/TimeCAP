Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture, especially during the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a generally stable to slightly rising trend, with minor increases in the mid-to-late morning and afternoon, consistent with improving conditions and possible clearing. Wind speeds were notably low during the early morning, with periods of calm, but increased significantly in the evening, particularly from the southwest, which may signal a shift in local wind patterns. The wind direction varied widely, with frequent southerly and westerly components early on and a shift toward more easterly and northerly flows later, potentially indicating changing synoptic influences or sea breeze development.
