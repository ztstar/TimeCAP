Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant cooling period in the early hours. Humidity increased dramatically during the night, stabilizing at near-saturation levels, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A consistent drop in air pressure in the late evening and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially signaling the onset of unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained light during the night but picked up in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, indicating a change in air mass and possible storm development. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests an elevated risk of precipitation or storms later in the day.
