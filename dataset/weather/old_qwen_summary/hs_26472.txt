Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping steadily as temperatures climbed, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased slightly in the early morning before declining again toward the end of the period, suggesting the passage of a weak front or shifting pressure system. Wind speeds strengthened notably in the mid-morning and early afternoon, with a shift toward more variable and stronger southerly and easterly flows, potentially bringing in moist air from the Gulf. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, especially if instability continues to grow.
