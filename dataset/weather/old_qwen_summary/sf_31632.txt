Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching saturation around dawn before sharply declining during the day, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to drier air. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction—particularly from westerly to more southerly and northerly—indicating dynamic atmospheric changes. These patterns point to a shift in local weather dynamics, likely driven by coastal influences and a passing frontal system, with potential for changing conditions in the coming hours.
