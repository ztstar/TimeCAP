Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the midday, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass, likely due to offshore winds and increased solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then steadily declined in the late afternoon and evening, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the overnight hours, particularly from the southwest, before calming significantly in the morning and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast later in the day. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a coastal frontal boundary, with increasing chances of fog and cooler, wetter conditions later in the day.
