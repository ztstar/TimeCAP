Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity dropped sharply in the early hours, remained low during midday, and then increased again in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend followed by possible moisture influx. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and into the morning, peaking in the early afternoon before declining slightly, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, potentially bringing unsettled conditions. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these trends point to a possible change in weather, possibly including precipitation later in the day.
