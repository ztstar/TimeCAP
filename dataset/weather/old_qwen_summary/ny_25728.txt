Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nighttime low and a daytime rebound. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or dew, reducing visibility and creating a damp feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the early morning hours before stabilizing and slightly increasing later, signaling a passing frontal system and potentially clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with shifting wind directions suggesting changing airflow patterns, possibly associated with a low-pressure system moving through. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and stable night into a more variable and potentially unsettled day, with possible scattered showers and fluctuating comfort levels.
