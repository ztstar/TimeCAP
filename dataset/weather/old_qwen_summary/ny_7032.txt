Over the past 24 hours, a marked temperature rise occurred during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of warming air masses and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating high moisture content likely due to overnight condensation or a boundary layer inversion, followed by a significant drying trend in the afternoon. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly in the late evening, hinting at a change in air flow patterns favoring warmer, moister air advection. These trends collectively point to a transition toward milder, drier, and more stable weather in New York City, with reduced chances of precipitation and improved visibility.
