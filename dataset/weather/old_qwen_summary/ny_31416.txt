Temperatures showed a gradual decline throughout the day, stabilizing at a cooler range in the latter half, indicating a sustained cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture, especially during nighttime hours, suggesting conditions conducive to fog or mist. Air pressure steadily decreased over the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined indicators point to a transition toward potentially inclement conditions, including possible rain or overcast skies in the near term.
