Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, starting moderately and rising sharply during the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure fluctuated slightly, with a notable drop followed by a rise, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely driven by a developing marine influence. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to westerly-southwesterly patterns points to changing airflow dynamics, potentially signaling the onset of a foggy or overcast period.
