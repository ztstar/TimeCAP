Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual cooling trend through the night, followed by a steady rise in the morning and early afternoon, indicating the arrival of warmer air. Humidity levels remained high during the early hours but declined significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the air mass evolved. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and plateaued in the mid-range, signaling the influence of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and then back toward the west-southwest, reflecting changing flow patterns around the high-pressure system. Combined, these indicators suggest the end of a cooler, damp period and the onset of a drier, more stable, and gradually warming weather regime.
