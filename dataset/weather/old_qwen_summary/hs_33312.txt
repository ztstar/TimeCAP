Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Temperature gradually decreased through the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a steady rise into the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels surged overnight, peaking in the early morning, which, combined with the falling pressure, increased the likelihood of thunderstorm development. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from a southerly to a more easterly and then a northerly flow, with a notable increase in speed late in the day, potentially signaling the passage of a frontal boundary. These combined factors point to an active weather regime, with elevated chances of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
