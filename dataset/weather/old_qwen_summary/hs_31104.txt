Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a dynamic temperature cycle likely driven by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of stable air and possible fog or low cloud cover during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a rise, pointing to the passage of a weather system that may have brought instability and precipitation. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a northerly to westerly direction, indicating a shift in airflow that could signal the approach of a front or storm system. Combined with fluctuating wind directions and sustained high moisture, these conditions suggest a heightened risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
