Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation likely associated with a stable boundary layer, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. A drop in air pressure toward the end of the period, particularly in the last few hours, signals the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with shifting wind directions indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly due to a developing frontal influence. These combined trends suggest the potential for thunderstorms or showers in the near term, especially as warm, moist air continues to build under a weakening high-pressure system.
