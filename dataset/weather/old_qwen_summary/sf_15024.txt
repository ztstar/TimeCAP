Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization and reduced wind speeds. Air pressure remained consistently high during the early to mid-day hours, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions, but dropped sharply in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were minimal throughout most of the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south-southwest, which may have contributed to the dispersion of fog and the mixing of air layers. The combination of high humidity, variable wind direction, and pressure changes suggests a transition period, possibly involving the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of more dynamic weather patterns.
