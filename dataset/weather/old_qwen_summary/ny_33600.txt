Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels show marked fluctuations, with sustained high values during the early morning hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon before rising again late in the day, indicating possible moisture influx or changes in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon, pointing to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearer conditions. Wind speeds exhibited a notable spike in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, suggesting dynamic atmospheric adjustments and potential for changing weather patterns. These combined trends suggest that while the city experienced a period of stable, humid conditions followed by a strengthening high pressure, the increasing wind activity may signal an approaching change in weather, possibly with cooler air or precipitation later.
