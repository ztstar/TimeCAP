Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a sharp decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and into early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise slightly, which is indicative of a passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely associated with the system's movement and frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the south-southeast suggests a change in air mass, potentially bringing milder conditions but also increasing the risk of precipitation as the system continues to evolve.
