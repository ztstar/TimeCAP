Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped sharply during the midday hours, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual decline, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher speeds from the northwest and west, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to more northerly and westerly sectors, combined with rising wind speeds and decreasing humidity, suggests the onset of a changing weather pattern that could bring storms or precipitation in the near term.
