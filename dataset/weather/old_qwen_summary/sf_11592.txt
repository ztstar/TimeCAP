Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the hours around dawn before declining, suggesting the influence of marine layer formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend through the morning, stabilizing in the mid-range, which reflects a stable atmospheric regime with no immediate signs of incoming storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light in the early hours, with calm periods during the night and morning, followed by a notable increase in the evening, particularly from the west-southwest, likely linked to the diurnal land-sea breeze cycle. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the evening, combined with rising humidity and temperature, may signal the potential for fog development or increased coastal cloud cover later tonight.
