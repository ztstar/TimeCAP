- S&P 500: The S&P 500 has demonstrated a strong upward trajectory over the past 20 market days, marked by sustained gains following an initial consolidation phase, indicating growing market momentum. A notable spike in the middle of the period was followed by a brief period of volatility and a minor correction, suggesting short-term profit-taking before renewed upward pressure resumed. The recent surge to a new high reflects strong investor confidence and potential bullish sentiment, positioning the index for continued upward movement if underlying fundamentals remain supportive.
- VIX (Volatility Index): The indicator has exhibited a pronounced downward trend over the past 20 market days, following an initial spike that signaled elevated market uncertainty. Recent values have stabilized near multi-week lows, suggesting a sustained decline in perceived market volatility and potential investor complacency. This sustained reduction, particularly after the early peak, may indicate improved market confidence, though the recent minor uptick could reflect emerging caution or short-term sentiment shifts.
- Nikkei 225: The indicator exhibited a strong upward trend over the initial 15 trading days, characterized by consistent gains and increasing momentum, suggesting positive market sentiment. This was followed by a sharp reversal and significant volatility, with a notable drop in the 18th day, likely driven by short-term market corrections or external shocks, before a strong recovery and renewed upward movement. The recent surge indicates potential accumulation or renewed bullish momentum, warranting close monitoring for sustainability amid heightened volatility.
- FTSE 100: The indicator has shown a pronounced upward trend over the past 20 market days, with a significant acceleration in the final week, suggesting growing market momentum and investor confidence.
