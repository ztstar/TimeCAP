Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before beginning a steady decline, indicating the dissipation of moisture-laden air. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a strong high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more easterly and then northerly direction, with increasing wind speeds in the afternoon, likely associated with a developing surface convergence or front. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, breezier day, potentially signaling the arrival of a drier air mass or a weakening of coastal moisture influence.
