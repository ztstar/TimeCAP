Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating the onset of a daytime heating cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moist air near the surface, potentially increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning before stabilizing, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors point to a transition toward more unstable and potentially rainy weather in the near term, warranting caution for commuters and outdoor activities.
