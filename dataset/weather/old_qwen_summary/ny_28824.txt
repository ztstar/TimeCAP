Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp increase during the night and early morning, indicating possible dew formation or fog, followed by a marked decrease during the midday hours. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before slowly rebounding, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing frontal dynamics. These combined indicators point to an active weather system moving through the region, likely bringing unstable conditions and potential for precipitation later in the day.
