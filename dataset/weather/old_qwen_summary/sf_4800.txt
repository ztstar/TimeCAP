Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before gradually declining, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling. A notable pressure dip occurred in the early hours, followed by a slow recovery, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal boundary through the region. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a brief but strong gust in the early morning, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with fog and cool temperatures likely affecting visibility and outdoor comfort, particularly in coastal neighborhoods.
