Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady overnight cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing into the early morning hours before beginning a slow recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the late evening and early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability during cooler periods. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the final hours, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. Wind speed remained consistently low and unidirectional, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the final hour, potentially signaling an approaching atmospheric change. These patterns collectively suggest a transition period, possibly leading to increased cloud cover or light precipitation as the system evolves.
