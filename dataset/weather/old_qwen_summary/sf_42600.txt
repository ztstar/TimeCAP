Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with several periods of near-saturation, particularly during the early morning and late night, suggesting conditions conducive to fog formation. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, transitioning from a consistent northwest flow to more variable and southerly patterns, accompanied by a spike in wind speed, indicating possible changes in atmospheric pressure gradients. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a gradual increase later in the day, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system influencing the region. These combined signals suggest a transition period in the weather, with lingering coastal fog and the potential for clearer skies later in the day as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
