Over the past 24 hours, a significant pressure rise was observed, indicating the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Temperature trends show a gradual warming, particularly during the afternoon and evening, suggesting increasing solar heating and a shift toward more comfortable conditions. Relative humidity increased steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a decline, which may signal clearing skies as the high pressure consolidates. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southerly direction to a more westerly and then northwesterly flow, aligning with the high-pressure system’s influence and reducing wind speeds. These combined factors point to improving weather conditions, with lower chances of precipitation and increasing clarity in the sky as the system strengthens over the region.
