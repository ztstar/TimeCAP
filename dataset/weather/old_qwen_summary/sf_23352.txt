Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and maintaining near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations but generally remained stable, with a minor drop in the final hours, suggesting possible changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were minimal through the night, increasing slightly in the afternoon and evening, with winds consistently coming from the southwest, indicating persistent marine influence. The combination of high humidity, cool temperatures, and onshore winds points to a strong likelihood of fog and overcast conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
