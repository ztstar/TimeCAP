Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests high moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. A steady increase in air pressure from mid-night through the morning indicates the influence of a high-pressure system, contributing to more stable and calm weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and late evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast, signaling a change in air mass movement. These patterns collectively suggest the approach of a more stable atmospheric regime, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but increasing the chance of fog during low-temperature periods.
