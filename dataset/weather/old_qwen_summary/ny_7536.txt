Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before slightly dropping in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then to a more easterly flow by late afternoon, which may have influenced temperature and moisture patterns. The overall pattern points to a transition from a moist, cool night to a drier, slightly warmer day, with the potential for improved visibility and stable weather conditions in the near term.
