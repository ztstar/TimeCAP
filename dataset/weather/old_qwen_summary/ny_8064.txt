Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 95%, which suggests increased moisture in the air and a higher likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, reaching a peak in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief surge in the early hours, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly, indicating a change in airflow associated with the developing high-pressure influence. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, with reduced chances of rain and improved visibility in the coming hours.
