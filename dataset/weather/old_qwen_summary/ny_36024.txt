Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a significant rebound in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the daytime, reflecting drier air aloft, but rose again in the early morning, suggesting overnight moisture accumulation, possibly due to dew formation or low-level cloud development. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before gradually increasing through the afternoon, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system followed by a strengthening high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds intensified throughout the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, indicating a change in airflow likely associated with the approaching high-pressure system. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and windy night to a warmer, drier, and increasingly stable day, with improving conditions expected in the coming hours.
