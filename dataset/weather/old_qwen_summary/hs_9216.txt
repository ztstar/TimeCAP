Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to warmer daytime air. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-level cloud cover. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a period of stable but slightly declining pressure, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable increase in the afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly to northeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. These combined factors suggest the influence of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
