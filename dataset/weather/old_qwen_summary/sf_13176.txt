Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a minimum during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning and indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region during certain seasons. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decline in the middle of the period, suggesting a weak low-pressure influence, though no major storm system was evident. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and west, consistent with coastal wind patterns driven by the marine layer. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the afternoon and evening signals a possible change in the local circulation, potentially bringing milder conditions or influencing fog dissipation later in the day.
