Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early night, particularly around the overnight hours, suggesting the presence of moist air and possible condensation or fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or a developing low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to variable directions, with a strong westerly component in the late afternoon, potentially indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, temperature fluctuations, and shifting wind directions suggests a transition period that could precede thunderstorm development or precipitation later in the day.
