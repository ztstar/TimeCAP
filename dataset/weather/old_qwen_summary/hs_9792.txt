Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking and remaining high through the night, indicating increasing moisture and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a significant drop during the early morning hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the high humidity and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, likely associated with a shift in wind direction and the influence of a developing frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a developing instability in the atmosphere, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
