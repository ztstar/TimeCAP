Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and radiative cooling. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with very low values during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air infiltration, followed by a midday surge that persisted into the evening, potentially signaling the arrival of moisture-laden air. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline in the early hours, reaching a low point before gradually rising, which may reflect the passage of a weak low-pressure system or front. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to more consistent, with a sustained southerly flow in the afternoon and evening, consistent with the onset of a warm air advection pattern. These combined trends suggest a transition from a dry, cool nocturnal phase to a humid, warming daytime regime, which could increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
