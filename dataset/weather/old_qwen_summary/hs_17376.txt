Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential development of convective activity. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, peaking in the early morning hours before steadily declining, which suggests a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, especially in the final 12 hours, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate and consistent, with a steady increase in wind direction toward the east-southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow that may enhance moisture transport. Together, these trends point to an environment conducive to thunderstorm development later in the day or overnight, particularly as warmer surface temperatures and decreasing pressure create instability.
