Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching a low point in the early morning hours before showing slight recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which indicates a strong potential for dew formation or fog, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure remained stable for most of the period, with a brief increase followed by a return to baseline, suggesting the absence of significant storm systems moving through. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest and back, hinting at subtle changes in local circulation or the influence of nearby weather features. These conditions together suggest a humid, stable, and potentially oppressive atmosphere, with limited chance of precipitation but increased discomfort due to high moisture and mild temperatures.
