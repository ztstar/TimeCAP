Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a persistent damp and foggy atmosphere typical of the region's microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the night before increasing in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of stronger gusts, and wind directions shifted notably from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns, indicating dynamic air flow changes near the coast. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a fog-prone, moist maritime environment toward a drier and more stable regime, likely reflecting the arrival of a high-pressure ridge influencing the Bay Area.
