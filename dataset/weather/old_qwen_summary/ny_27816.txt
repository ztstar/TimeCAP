Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City experienced a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually recovering in the afternoon. A significant increase in humidity, peaking at saturation, coincided with the coldest period, indicating the likelihood of fog or light precipitation during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the late night and morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief spike during the early morning hours, and wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a cold, moist air mass to a drier, more stable environment, likely resulting in improving visibility and mild conditions by late afternoon.
