Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a steady warming during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn before rapidly declining, suggesting the presence of nocturnal condensation followed by daytime drying. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before gradually declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and potential for fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with a brief increase in the early morning hours, followed by near-still conditions, while wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and light winds points to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable atmospheric conditions in the coming hours.
