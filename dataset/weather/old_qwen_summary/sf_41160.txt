Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with periods of near-saturation followed by sharp declines, indicating alternating influences of marine air and dry inland air. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly and northerly directions to more variable and stronger southerly and easterly flows in the late evening, possibly signaling a change in atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a drier, potentially windier environment, which may influence local coastal weather and visibility in the coming hours.
