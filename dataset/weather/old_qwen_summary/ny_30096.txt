Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City experienced a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal swing likely driven by clear skies and warming sunlight. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting overnight condensation and fog formation, before dropping sharply in the afternoon as air warmed and dried. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a weather system, possibly a cold front or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and eventually westerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, increasing wind speeds, and falling pressure suggests a transition toward unstable conditions, potentially leading to gusty winds and scattered showers in the coming hours.
