Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking sharply before dropping dramatically in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the early morning, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speed remained relatively low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly and northerly patterns, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These trends collectively point to a transition from a humid, cooler night to a drier, warming day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely resulting in improving conditions and clearer skies in the coming hours.
