Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in atmospheric pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a slight increase in the afternoon, suggesting a warming trend typical of the region’s diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly, particularly in the late evening and early morning, reaching near saturation, which enhances the perception of mugginess and increases the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds increased during the afternoon and evening, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, consistent with moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions collectively point to a high probability of thunderstorm development, especially overnight, due to the combination of rising instability, abundant moisture, and converging air masses.
