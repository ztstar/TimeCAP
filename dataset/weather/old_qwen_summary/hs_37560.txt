Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a persistent rise in temperature during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained near saturation for most of the period, with only brief reductions, suggesting high moisture content in the air and a strong potential for convective activity. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or a developing weather disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts reaching higher velocities and shifting direction toward the southeast and south, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined factors—rising temperatures, saturated humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds—point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms, especially later in the evening and overnight.
