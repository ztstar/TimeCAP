Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant overnight cooling phase likely influenced by marine layer development. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which coincided with dense fog and low visibility, typical of the city’s coastal climate patterns. A notable wind surge occurred during the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west, suggesting the arrival of a coastal onshore flow that likely contributed to the fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decline in the middle of the night before stabilizing, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems but consistent influence from local maritime conditions. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and intermittent wind shifts points to a persistent marine layer, which may continue to affect visibility and morning commutes.
