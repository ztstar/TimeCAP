Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and remaining low into the early morning hours before a slight recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation during the early morning. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which suggests the passage of a low-pressure system bringing unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to easterly, consistent with storm development and frontal passage. These combined factors point to a period of deteriorating weather, including potential for precipitation and reduced visibility, particularly during the overnight hours.
