Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the overnight and early morning periods, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or low clouds. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, stabilizing later, pointing to a possible passing frontal system or low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and later to easterly, suggesting changing air flow patterns associated with the atmospheric shift. These conditions collectively indicate a humid, unstable environment that could support the development of isolated thunderstorms, particularly during the late afternoon or evening hours.
