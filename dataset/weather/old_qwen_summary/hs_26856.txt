Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a period of stable to gradually increasing temperatures, with a notable rise in the afternoon hours, indicating warming trends during daylight. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, suggesting saturated air conditions that contribute to a muggy atmosphere and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed fluctuating patterns with a brief peak followed by a general decline, which may signal the approach of a weather system conducive to storm development. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with consistent easterly to southerly flow, reinforcing the transport of moist maritime air into the region. Combined, these conditions point to an environment ripe for thunderstorm formation, especially during the late afternoon and evening hours.
