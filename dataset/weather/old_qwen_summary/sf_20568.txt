Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily throughout the day, indicating a shift toward a more stable and moderately warmer atmospheric state. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a saturated air mass that could promote fog formation or persistent cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloudiness and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the day, especially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, which is typical for marine layer development and enhanced coastal mixing. Together, these trends point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern likely driven by an onshore flow, with conditions favorable for fog, cool temperatures, and potentially unsettled weather in the near term.
