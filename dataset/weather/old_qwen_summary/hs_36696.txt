Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with a slight rise in the late night and early morning, which may indicate the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing through the day, while wind direction showed a shift from predominantly north-easterly to more variable patterns, with a notable southerly influence in the late evening.
