Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures showing a steady decline during the night and early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A significant rise in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, particularly from the northeast, before subsiding later in the day, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined indicators point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment toward a drier, more stable daytime regime, signaling improving conditions with reduced potential for thunderstorms.
