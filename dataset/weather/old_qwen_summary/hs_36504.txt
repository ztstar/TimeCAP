Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nocturnal cooling event likely associated with clear skies and low humidity. A marked increase in humidity during the late night and early morning, coinciding with a sharp drop in air pressure, suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, with sustained gusts from the northeast and east, consistent with a frontal boundary approaching the region. The shift in wind direction from the north and west to the southeast later in the day points to the influence of a developing low-pressure system or moisture influx from the Gulf. These combined factors indicate a high likelihood of thunderstorms or showers in the near term, particularly as the system continues to organize over the region.
