Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then sharply decreased during midday, suggesting a drying trend associated with the front’s influence. Air pressure steadily increased through the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late hours, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the midday to late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction from northwest to northeast, reflecting changing synoptic-scale flow. Overall, the data indicate a transition from a cool, humid, and unstable environment to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming regime, likely leading to improved conditions for outdoor activities in the coming hours.
