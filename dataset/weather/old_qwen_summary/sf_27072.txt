Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping as temperatures rose, indicating a transition from a damp, foggy condition to a drier atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, but increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, which may signal a change in local airflow patterns. These combined shifts suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to a more stable, drier, and slightly breezier environment.
