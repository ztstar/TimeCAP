Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced consistently stable atmospheric conditions, with minimal variation across all measured parameters. Temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction have remained nearly constant, indicating a lack of significant weather systems or disturbances. The persistent low humidity levels suggest dry air, which may increase fire risk in nearby vegetation. The steady wind from a southeasterly direction likely contributes to the stable marine layer influence typical of the region’s coastal climate. This prolonged period of unchanging conditions implies limited near-term weather change, with no immediate precipitation or temperature shifts expected.
