Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend throughout the day, particularly noticeable during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moisture and a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable decline during midday, followed by a recovery and sustained increase in the evening, signaling a transition from a low-pressure system to a more stable high-pressure environment. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the clearing of clouds and the lowering of humidity. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather shift, with improving conditions and a likely transition to clearer, cooler, and more stable air later in the day.
