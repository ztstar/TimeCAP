Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent temperature indicates a lack of thermal variation, suggesting a stable air mass dominating the region. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk and reduced comfort for outdoor activities. Persistent light winds from a southerly direction (around 130 degrees) suggest a steady, unchanging airflow, likely influenced by a high-pressure system positioned offshore. Overall, the weather remains calm and dry, with minimal potential for precipitation or storm development in the immediate forecast.
