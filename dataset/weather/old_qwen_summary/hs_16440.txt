Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight downward trend in the late afternoon, suggesting possible weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that intensified slightly in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, drier day, with potential for developing convective activity later in the evening.
