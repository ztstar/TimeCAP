Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a sustained drop in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier air. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, fair weather. Wind speeds intensified through the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with the influence of an approaching cold front. These combined patterns suggest that a cold front has passed through, bringing cooler, drier conditions and setting the stage for clearer skies in the coming hours.
