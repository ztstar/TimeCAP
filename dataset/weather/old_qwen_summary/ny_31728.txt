Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend throughout the day, indicating a transition from a cold overnight period into a milder afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a marked decrease during the late night and early morning, reaching their lowest point before rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting dry air influx followed by increased moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, stabilizing at a high level, which typically correlates with clear skies and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts recorded, driven by a consistent wind direction from the northwest to west-northwest, indicating a possible influence from a developing high-pressure system. The combination of rising temperatures, low humidity, stable pressure, and strong winds points to a dry, cool, and breezy day with potential for improved visibility and reduced chance of precipitation.
