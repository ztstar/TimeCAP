Temperature trends show a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual回暖 in the morning hours, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the evening and remained elevated through the night, suggesting moisture-laden air masses were present, likely contributing to a high chance of fog or dew. Air pressure exhibited a slight drop during the night, followed by a recovery in the morning, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from east-southeast to south-southwest, hinting at changing air flow patterns. These combined conditions point to a transition period, potentially increasing the risk of scattered showers or thunderstorms as the system evolves.
