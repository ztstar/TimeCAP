Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, dropping sharply during midday as the sun rose, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight decline toward the evening, consistent with the arrival of a weak weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the breakdown of the marine layer and improved air circulation. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and then to southerly suggests changing atmospheric patterns, potentially signaling a transition in the local weather regime.
