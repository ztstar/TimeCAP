Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent clearing. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, stabilizing the atmosphere and likely suppressing cloud formation, though a brief spike in pressure later in the day may reflect a passing high-pressure ridge. Wind patterns showed a consistent shift from a stable northerly flow to occasional gusts from the south and east, with brief periods of calm, possibly due to localized topographic effects or sea breeze dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable regime, which may lead to clearer skies and warmer conditions in the coming hours.
