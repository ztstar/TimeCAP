Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture and favorable conditions for fog or dew formation. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stable, damp conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with calm or light winds, but increased in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment toward a more variable and potentially drier daytime regime as pressure stabilizes and winds pick up.
