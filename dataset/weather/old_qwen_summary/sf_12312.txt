Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable shift in atmospheric conditions, beginning with stable, cool temperatures and high humidity, followed by a significant warming trend during midday. A sharp drop in humidity coincided with rising temperatures and the arrival of stronger, more variable winds, suggesting the influence of a shifting air mass. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the early afternoon, peaking before a sudden decline, indicative of a passing weather front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to easterly directions, with strong gusts in the late afternoon, likely driven by local topography and pressure gradients. These changes point to the passage of a low-pressure system, bringing unstable conditions and potentially triggering brief showers or fog dissipation in the coastal areas.
