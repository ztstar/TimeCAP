Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather. Temperature trends show a significant warming during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a warm air mass moving in, likely ahead of the approaching front. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight and then dropped dramatically during the day, reflecting a shift from stable, moist conditions to drier, more unstable air as the system evolved. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, confirming the intensification of the system and potential for gusty conditions. The shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and then westward aligns with typical flow around a developing low-pressure system, pointing to the likelihood of storms or heavy showers in the near term.
