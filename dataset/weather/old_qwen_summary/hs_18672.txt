Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours and gradually declined into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of increasing surface heating and reduced moisture availability. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with the development of a strengthening onshore flow. These combined patterns point to a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, with increased chances of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
