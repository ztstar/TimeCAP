Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the overnight hours, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a slight increase overnight, followed by a decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable reduction during the early morning hours, while wind direction shifted from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in air mass flow. These conditions collectively suggest a developing low-pressure influence, raising the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
