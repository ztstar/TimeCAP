Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the approach and consolidation of a high-pressure system, which generally leads to stable, dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a northerly to a more southerly direction during the night and early morning, followed by a return to a southerly flow, consistent with onshore winds bringing moist maritime air. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and rising pressure points to a persistent marine layer that may have caused foggy conditions overnight, with a gradual clearing expected as the day progresses.
