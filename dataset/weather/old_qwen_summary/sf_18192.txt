Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before modest recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, indicating increased moisture in the air likely due to nighttime condensation or marine influence. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds remained light throughout most of the period, with a notable lull in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a shift in wind patterns. The wind direction shifted from a northerly to a southerly component over the course of the day, consistent with a change in synoptic flow that could influence fog development and coastal weather conditions.
