Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning a gradual decline, indicating a transition from a saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which suggests the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southerly to a more southeasterly and then easterly direction, with moderate to brisk speeds, likely contributing to the air mass change. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather shift, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions and increased chances of thunderstorms later in the day.
