Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture and a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, with a brief rise during the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weak high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southwest, which may have contributed to the mixing of air and evaporation of moisture. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward more stable, fairer weather, though residual moisture could still support isolated afternoon showers.
