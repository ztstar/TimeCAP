Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a notable warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of daytime heating and changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking at saturation, which suggests moisture-laden air masses and a heightened potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a significant spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sustained drop, signaling the passage of a weather system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and variable, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the development of localized convection. These combined factors point to an active boundary zone affecting the region, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term.
