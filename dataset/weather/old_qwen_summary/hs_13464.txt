Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating diurnal temperature variation typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of nocturnal dew formation and subsequent evaporation as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the period, particularly in the late evening and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, hinting at the influence of a developing circulation pattern. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
