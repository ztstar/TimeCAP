Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early hours before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation around dawn, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low clouds during the early morning hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rebound in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system that may have brought coastal fog and wind shifts. Wind speeds were generally moderate overnight but intensified in the late afternoon, with gusts from the northwest and west, contributing to the dispersal of fog and a return to clearer skies. The shift in wind direction from offshore to more onshore patterns late in the cycle hints at a possible re-establishment of marine influence, which could bring cooler, moist air back into the region.
