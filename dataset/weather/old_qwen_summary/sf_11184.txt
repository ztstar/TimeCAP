Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels exhibited extreme fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high humidity interspersed with sharp drops, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses and possible fog formation and dissipation cycles. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with a notable increase during the afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low, with a significant surge toward the end of the period, likely associated with a change in wind direction from westerly to more southerly or southwesterly, which could reflect the onset of a coastal breeze or pressure gradient shift. The consistent shift in wind direction during the late evening and overnight hours, particularly toward the south and southeast, may indicate the influence of regional topography and the development of a localized sea breeze pattern.
