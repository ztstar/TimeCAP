Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining into the early morning hours before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting moist air accumulation, which may have contributed to fog or dew formation. A notable rise in atmospheric pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and early morning, with stronger gusts originating from the north and northwest, likely due to a shifting pressure gradient. The change in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly suggests a transition in air mass, potentially signaling a shift toward drier and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
