Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking during the overnight period, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable low-pressure system passed through the region in the early hours, causing a temporary but sharp decrease in air pressure and intensifying wind speeds, particularly from the southwest. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northerly directions, suggesting changing air mass influences, possibly bringing cooler marine air inland. The return to higher pressure and stable wind conditions later in the day points to improving weather, though lingering moisture may support continued overcast skies or light drizzle.
