Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation before dropping sharply during the day, indicating the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying. A notable pressure spike occurred in the late night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable conditions and reduced wind activity. Wind patterns shifted from variable and light in the early hours to more consistent and stronger from the southwest, with gusts increasing in the late evening. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, potentially storm-prone environment to a drier, more stable atmosphere, reducing the immediate risk of thunderstorms but possibly increasing heat retention during the day.
