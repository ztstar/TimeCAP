Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a slightly milder day. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, reflecting dense fog or low cloud cover, which gradually decreased as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, signaling a change in airflow possibly linked to a coastal adjustment or sea breeze development. These conditions collectively point to a transition from foggy, damp overnight conditions to a more stable, gradually warming environment during the day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
