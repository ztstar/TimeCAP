Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping steadily through the night, indicating a transition from daytime heating to nocturnal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a period of high moisture followed by drying, likely due to a shift in air mass or wind pattern. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which is often associated with approaching atmospheric instability or a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, signaling a change in circulation that may have contributed to the drying trend. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather shift, potentially influenced by a passing front, which could result in unsettled conditions, including possible thunderstorms, in the coming hours.
