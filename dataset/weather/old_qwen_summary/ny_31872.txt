Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions during the early hours, before dropping significantly in the midday and afternoon. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that indicate changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition in weather patterns, potentially leading to unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, as the low-pressure system continues to influence the region.
