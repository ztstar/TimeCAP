Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, suggesting a shift from a stable, moist air mass to more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing and then slightly fluctuating in the afternoon, consistent with a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or frontal influence. These combined trends suggest a transition toward more unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the potential for localized thunderstorms later in the day.
