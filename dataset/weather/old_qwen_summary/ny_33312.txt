Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a cooling front passed through the city overnight. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night before declining, indicating possible precipitation or fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increasing wind speeds, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Winds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and west, which may contribute to further storm development. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and stronger, shifting winds points to an active weather pattern, likely bringing unsettled conditions such as rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
