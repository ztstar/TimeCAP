Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which is typically associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual warming throughout the day, suggesting a buildup of heat during the afternoon hours, likely due to solar radiation and reduced wind mixing. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which increases the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained gusts from the south to southwest, aligning with the storm's circulation and enhancing moisture transport. Combined with the persistent southerly wind direction and falling pressure, these conditions signal a high probability of precipitation, particularly later in the day or overnight.
