Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity remained near saturation through the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of stable atmospheric conditions conducive to fog or low clouds, which later decreased significantly as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the midday and evening, signaling the approach or influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the late evening, possibly indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing local circulation. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, drier, and more stable daytime pattern, likely leading to improved conditions for outdoor activities and reduced risk of precipitation.
