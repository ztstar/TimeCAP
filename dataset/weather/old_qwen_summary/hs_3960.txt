Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a transition from nighttime low temperatures to daytime heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking near saturation in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a trough before beginning to stabilize, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought moist, unstable air. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift from southerly to easterly and then northerly directions, signaling a change in air mass and potential for gusty conditions. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates a high likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly as temperatures rise and atmospheric instability increases.
