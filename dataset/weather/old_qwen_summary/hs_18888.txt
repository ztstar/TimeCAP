Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southwesterly, consistent with a changing pressure gradient and possible storm development. These atmospheric changes collectively point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with a heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms due to rising instability and moisture advection.
