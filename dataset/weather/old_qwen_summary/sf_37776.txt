Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching saturation during the early morning hours before sharply dropping in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. A significant drop in air pressure during the early hours indicated the influence of a low-pressure system, which later stabilized as pressure rose through the afternoon, signaling the system's dissipation. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and late afternoon, with strong southwest to south winds likely contributing to the cooling and moisture influx, while the shift to light easterly winds later in the day suggests a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns point to a dynamic weather transition likely associated with a frontal passage, resulting in cooler, moister conditions overnight and a gradual return to more stable, drier conditions by evening.
