Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the latter half of the period, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or precipitation as moisture-laden air accumulated. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, especially in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with frontal passage. These indicators collectively point to the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of rain or overcast conditions in the near term.
