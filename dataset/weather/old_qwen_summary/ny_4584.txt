Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels steadily increased during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, suggesting a moist air mass was present, which may have contributed to fog or low visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the evening, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly in the morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening and overnight, with a strong gust recorded in the final hours, driven by a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric conditions. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and strong winds suggests the potential for precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term, particularly as the system continues to evolve.
