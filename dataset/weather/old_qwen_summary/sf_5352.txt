Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, peaking near saturation during the night and dropping sharply in the mid-morning, suggesting fog formation followed by dissipation due to warming and wind. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, which typically correlates with fair weather and atmospheric stability. Wind patterns were initially light and variable, with a notable increase in speed and a shift toward westerly and southerly directions during the late afternoon, likely driven by a coastal breee system. The combination of rising pressure, clearing skies, and strengthening winds points to the end of a foggy, cool period and the onset of a drier, more stable, and potentially sunny day ahead.
