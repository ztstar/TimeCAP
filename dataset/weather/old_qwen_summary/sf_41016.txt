Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced drop in the midday and afternoon, indicating a drying trend likely due to a shift in wind patterns and reduced cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a brief spike in the early hours, suggesting a temporary influence of a high-pressure system, which may have contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the arrival of a sea breeze or a shift in regional airflow. The combination of dropping humidity, increasing wind speed, and variable wind direction points to a transition in local weather dynamics, possibly leading to more stable conditions later in the day.
