Temperature showed a steady increase throughout the day, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon hours. Humidity remained near saturation for most of the period, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or clearing conditions. Air pressure rose gradually and stabilized at a high level, which is typically associated with stable, fair weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of increased activity and directional shifts, including a sustained change toward the south and southeast in the evening, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and shifting wind patterns may indicate a transition from a damp, stable air mass to a drier, more variable one, with implications for local weather stability in the coming hours.
