Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with a notable dry spell in the middle of the night followed by a marked increase in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass succeeded by moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, indicating improving weather conditions and potential clearing skies. Wind activity was minimal overall, with a brief surge in gusts during the early morning hours, followed by calm conditions, which may have contributed to the temperature inversion and localized fog. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and easterly patterns hints at changing atmospheric circulation, possibly signaling the approach of a new weather system.
