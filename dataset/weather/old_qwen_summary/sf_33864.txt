Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. A significant increase in humidity occurred during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply dropping during midday, suggesting the presence of marine fog that likely dissipated with increasing solar heating. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, hinting at possible approaching atmospheric changes, though no major system was evident. Wind speeds remained generally low overnight, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a notable shift toward the southeast and later the northwest, which may reflect changing local circulation patterns. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable air mass—potentially signaling the end of a coastal fog event and the onset of clearer skies.
