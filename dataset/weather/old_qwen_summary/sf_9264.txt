Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking near the surface, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-day, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that brought increased moisture and instability to the region. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent easterly to a more variable direction, with a brief increase in speed and a change toward more southerly and westerly flows, indicating dynamic atmospheric adjustment. These conditions suggest a transition period marked by coastal fog, potential for light precipitation, and increasing wind activity, which may influence local travel and outdoor activities.
