Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight period, peaking during the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating potential fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid to late afternoon, which may suggest weakening high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased noticeably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and then the southwest, consistent with coastal breezes and possible marine layer movement. These conditions point to a typical San Francisco coastal pattern, with cool, foggy mornings and improving conditions by afternoon, although a return to lower temperatures and higher humidity is likely overnight.
