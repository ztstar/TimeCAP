Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning and remaining high through mid-morning, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further precipitation or unstable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase to strong levels in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, consistent with an incoming storm front. These combined patterns point to the arrival of a maritime weather system, likely bringing overcast skies, drizzle, or light rain in the near term.
