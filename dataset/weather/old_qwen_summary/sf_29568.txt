Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking during the early hours before dropping steadily, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased humidity, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, before increasing in the late afternoon, primarily from the west and south, likely due to the influence of coastal dynamics. These changes point to an approaching weather shift, potentially bringing more unsettled conditions, including possible fog or light precipitation, especially given the earlier high moisture content and pressure changes.
