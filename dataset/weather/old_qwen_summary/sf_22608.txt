Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early hours, remaining near 100% for an extended period, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, consistent with a stable marine layer. Wind speeds were generally low, particularly during the overnight hours, with calmer conditions and a shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest, reinforcing the influence of coastal maritime air. These conditions point to a persistent marine layer with foggy, cool, and damp weather typical of San Francisco's microclimate, especially during transitional periods between day and night.
