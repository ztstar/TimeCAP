Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred during the night, with winds transitioning from southerly to westerly and then increasing in speed and changing direction to northerly in the late evening, suggesting a change in air mass. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the night, culminating in a peak just before dawn, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to the influence of coastal upwelling and a strengthening marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, which may lead to continued foggy conditions into the early part of the next day.
