Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend began in the early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting a shift in air mass. A steady decline in air pressure occurred from midday onward, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily from the afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, reinforcing the influence of a developing frontal system. These indicators collectively suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially stormy weather, with the possibility of precipitation and stronger winds in the near future.
