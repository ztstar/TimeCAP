Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a cooler, more oppressive feel during the overnight period. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, aligning with the movement of a cold front through the region. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and a shift toward more northerly winds points to improving weather, with drier and more pleasant conditions expected in the coming hours.
