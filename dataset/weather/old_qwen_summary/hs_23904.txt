Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking during the early morning before declining steadily through the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and into the afternoon, reaching a high before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained light during most of the day, but increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These observations point to the influence of a developing weather front, potentially bringing unstable conditions and the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the evening or overnight.
