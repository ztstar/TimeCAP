Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching peak saturation in the early hours before stabilizing and slightly decreasing as temperatures climbed. A consistent drop in air pressure during the late night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloud cover and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to an active weather transition, with potential for unsettled conditions, including possible showers or thunderstorms, particularly in the overnight hours.
