Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increasing moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, culminating in a low-pressure system that may have contributed to unstable atmospheric conditions and the likelihood of precipitation. Wind patterns exhibited shifts in direction, especially around dawn, with a notable change from easterly to northerly and then southerly flows, which could signal the approach of a frontal boundary. Combined, these indicators point to a developing weather system that may bring overcast skies, increased chances of rain, and cooler conditions in the near term.
