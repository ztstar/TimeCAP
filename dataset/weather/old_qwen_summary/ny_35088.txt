Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward milder conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend during the early hours, reaching a low point before stabilizing and slightly increasing later in the day, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained light throughout most of the period, with a brief increase in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly and then toward the west-southwest, hinting at changing air mass influences. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a weakening low-pressure system, leading to a transition from cool, humid conditions to increasingly dry and mild weather in New York City.
