Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking at near-saturation, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture in the air. Air pressure remained stable or slightly increased through the morning, with a minor drop in the late afternoon, which may signal a weakening of a high-pressure system or the influence of a developing weather front. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the period, with a brief increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest a shift from a damp, stable nocturnal regime to a drier, more variable daytime atmosphere, with possible implications for fog dissipation and improved visibility later in the day.
