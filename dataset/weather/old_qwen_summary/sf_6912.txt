Temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of marine fog or dense low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, culminating in a notable rise by midday, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with near-calm conditions and variable directions, but increased slightly in the late afternoon, likely due to a shift in local wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, potentially breaking up fog and improving visibility in the city.
