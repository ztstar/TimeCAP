Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with high values in the early morning and late night, indicating fog formation and condensation, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring more unstable weather. Wind speeds increased substantially during the morning hours, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with marine layer dynamics and coastal breezes. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly sectors in the late evening hints at changing synoptic conditions, possibly signaling a transition in airflow patterns affecting coastal temperatures and fog persistence.
