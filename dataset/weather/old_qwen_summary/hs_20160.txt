Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a saturated atmosphere that may have contributed to reduced visibility and a muggy feel. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, correlating with increasing wind speeds and shifts in wind direction, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly directions, which may signal a change in air mass, potentially bringing in moisture-laden air. The overall pattern points to a developing weather instability, with conditions favorable for afternoon thunderstorms, especially as temperatures rise and atmospheric moisture persists.
