Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated before declining steadily through the afternoon, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure increased notably during the night, reaching a peak before gradually falling, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, increasing slightly overnight before subsiding, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns point to the dissipation of marine layer fog and the potential for clearer skies in the coming hours, though residual moisture may linger.
