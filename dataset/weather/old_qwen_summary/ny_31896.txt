Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining near saturation for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist during the overnight period. A gradual increase in air pressure was observed, particularly during the early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These trends collectively point to a transition from a damp, cool, and stable overnight period toward a gradually warming and drier afternoon, with improving visibility and conditions expected in the coming hours.
