Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight before sharply declining during the daytime, suggesting clearing skies and improved air circulation as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a consistent rise from the early morning into the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and again midday, with wind direction shifting from northerly to southerly and then toward the west and northwest, reflecting changing frontal influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cool, and breezy period to a drier, warmer, and more stable atmosphere, likely resulting in improving conditions for outdoor activities later in the day.
