Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping steadily during the day, indicating a transition from a moist maritime influence to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly from the northeast, signaling a shift in airflow that may be associated with a developing weather front. The combination of falling pressure, fluctuating wind direction, and variable humidity suggests a dynamic atmosphere likely to result in overcast skies and a potential for fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
