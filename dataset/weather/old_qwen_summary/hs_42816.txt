Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and increasing solar exposure. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, reducing visibility and creating a muggy feel. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no significant storm systems approaching. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction that may reflect the onset of a local circulation pattern or a change in large-scale airflow. These conditions point to a transition from a stable, humid night to a warmer, breezier day, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and instability continue to build.
