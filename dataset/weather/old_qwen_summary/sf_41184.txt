Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the mid-morning and early evening, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief intensification in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by localized pressure gradients. Combined, these patterns suggest the dissipation of marine fog and the onset of a more stable, sunnier regime, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal coastal weather cycle.
