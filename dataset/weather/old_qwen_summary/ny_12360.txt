Over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from stable overnight conditions to drier air. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point before a slight recovery, which may indicate the influence of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly including precipitation or a shift in temperature later in the day.
