Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight and early morning hours, reaching saturation before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point rise followed by daytime drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the day, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that has likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were initially moderate and variable, with a notable surge in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing flow patterns possibly associated with a passing frontal influence. Together, these trends point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, which may increase the risk of localized thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are re-introduced later in the day.
