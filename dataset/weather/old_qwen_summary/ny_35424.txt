Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool, stable conditions to a more moderate phase. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, potentially reducing visibility and increasing the perception of chill. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought overcast skies and precipitation. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and later toward the west-southwest, consistent with the movement of a frontal system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a lingering moist air mass, increasing the likelihood of continued drizzle or light rain in the near term.
