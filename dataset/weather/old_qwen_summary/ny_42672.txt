Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during nighttime hours, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that may contribute to fog or drizzle conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, culminating in lower values in the late evening, which often precedes approaching storm systems or unsettled weather.
