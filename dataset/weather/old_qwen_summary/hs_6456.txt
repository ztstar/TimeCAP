Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a steady rise into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a pronounced cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels climbed sharply in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or an approaching front. Wind speeds remained generally low during the day, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to westerly and then northerly, potentially indicating changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest an active weather shift, with the potential for afternoon thunderstorms or gusty conditions later in the day as the atmosphere destabilizes.
