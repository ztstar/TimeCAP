A significant temperature drop occurred during the early hours, followed by a gradual warming trend that stabilized in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to more moderate daytime temperatures. Humidity levels showed a sharp spike in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which dissipated as the day progressed, only to return later in the evening. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline during the overnight hours, followed by a slow recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric stability. Wind patterns were generally light and variable, with brief increases in speed and shifts in direction, particularly during the late night and early morning, possibly linked to local topographic influences. Overall, the data suggest a dynamic overnight transition, with conditions shifting from cool, foggy, and stable to warmer and more variable, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate behavior.
