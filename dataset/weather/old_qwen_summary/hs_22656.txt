Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, indicating a transition from a more humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more active daytime atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, suggesting changing flow patterns associated with the approaching high. These combined trends suggest improving weather conditions with reduced precipitation risk and increasing comfort levels as the high-pressure system consolidates.
