Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels peaked overnight and remained near saturation during the early hours, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist boundary layer that likely contributed to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing before a notable drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to stronger and more directional in the late afternoon and evening, with a marked increase in speed and a change in direction toward the west and south, possibly indicating an approaching frontal boundary. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, where a stable, humid air mass is being displaced by a more dynamic system, increasing the potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
