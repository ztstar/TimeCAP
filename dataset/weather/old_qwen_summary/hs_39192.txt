Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual rise. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours, reaching saturation and contributing to foggy conditions, which likely reduced visibility and created a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the evening and into the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, likely driven by a developing low-pressure feature or frontal boundary. These combined conditions—high humidity, decreasing temperature, and strengthening winds—indicate a transition period that may precede a shift toward more unsettled weather, including possible thunderstorms later in the day.
