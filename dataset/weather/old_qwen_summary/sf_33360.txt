Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining into the early hours before gradually warming again. Humidity remained high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon before rising again in the late evening, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking just before midday, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, driven by strong northwest winds, which likely contributed to the cooling and increased humidity, before subsiding toward the end of the period. The change in wind direction from the north/northwest to the west/southwest late in the cycle hints at the influence of a coastal breeze or a shift in synoptic-scale flow, potentially signaling the onset of more variable or unsettled conditions.
