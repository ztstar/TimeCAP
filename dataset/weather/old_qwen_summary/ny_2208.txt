Temperature trends show a gradual decline overnight, followed by a slight recovery in the early morning, indicating a cooling period likely due to nighttime radiative loss. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, peaking during the hours of lowest temperature, suggesting increased moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure exhibited a consistent drop throughout the night, stabilizing at a low level before a slight rebound, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest the presence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing overcast skies and a higher chance of precipitation in the near term.
