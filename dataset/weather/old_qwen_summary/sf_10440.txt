Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours, indicating increasing moisture availability and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts late in the cycle, notably from the southeast and northeast, which could signal shifting airflow associated with the evolving system. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind direction points to a transition toward potentially overcast or foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
