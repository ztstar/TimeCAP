Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation levels through the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog or low visibility. A gradual decrease in air pressure during the early hours, particularly in the middle of the night, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with changing weather conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly directions, accompanied by increasing wind speeds in the evening, signaling a dynamic atmospheric adjustment. These combined factors point to an active weather transition, potentially bringing precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
