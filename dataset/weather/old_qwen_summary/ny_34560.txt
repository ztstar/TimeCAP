Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before showing a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of moist air and potentially increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline during the night, followed by a steady rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified overnight, particularly from the southwest to west-southwest, with strong gusts by mid-morning, likely due to atmospheric instability associated with the passing front. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northerly and westerly in the morning suggests a change in air mass, possibly bringing drier and cooler conditions, with implications for improved visibility and reduced precipitation risk later in the day.
