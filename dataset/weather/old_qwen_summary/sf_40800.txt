Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clear skies and stable conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by consistent winds from the southwest, which may have brought in marine air and contributed to the cooling and fog development. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast in the afternoon suggests a possible onshore flow, which could signal the arrival of a new marine influence or a change in the larger-scale weather pattern.
