Temperature showed a nocturnal dip followed by a gradual rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooling overnight and warming during daylight hours. Humidity peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting overnight moisture accumulation, which then declined as temperatures rose, reducing relative humidity. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction, including a notable change from southwest to more variable and northerly flows. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a frontal system, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
