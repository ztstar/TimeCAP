Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that dissipated with warming and wind changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout much of the night but dropped notably in the early morning before rising again, pointing to a passing weather system or pressure trough. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but increased substantially in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly, potentially signaling a change in regional airflow patterns. These conditions together suggest a transition from a fog-prone, stable marine layer to a drier, more ventilated atmosphere, which may lead to clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
