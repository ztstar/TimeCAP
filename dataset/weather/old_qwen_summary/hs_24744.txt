Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and increased comfort levels before dawn. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours coincided with a shift in wind patterns, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or a weakening front. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and again at night, with directional shifts indicating a complex interaction of local and regional airflow, possibly linked to a developing convection or frontal activity. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable winds signals a potentially unstable atmosphere, raising the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
