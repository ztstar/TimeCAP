Humidity levels began high and dropped significantly during mid-morning before spiking again in the evening, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture front or localized precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the early hours, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system bringing unsettled conditions.
