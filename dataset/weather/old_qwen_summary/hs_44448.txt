Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, reaching a minimum in the early hours before rising again in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a shift toward more moist air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with stronger gusts observed in the early morning and later afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwest to northeast, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the data points to a transition from cooler, drier conditions to warmer, more humid air under the influence of an approaching high-pressure ridge, potentially leading to fair weather with a slight chance of afternoon thunderstorms if moisture continues to accumulate.
