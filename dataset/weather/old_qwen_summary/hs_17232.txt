Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nocturnal to daytime thermal conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which suggests a saturated atmosphere conducive to potential precipitation. Air pressure showed a slow but steady increase, particularly during midday and afternoon, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions in the morning and later veering to more easterly to northeasterly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. Taken together, these indicators point to a stable, humid air mass with diminishing instability, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms but maintaining a muggy, oppressive feel through the evening.
