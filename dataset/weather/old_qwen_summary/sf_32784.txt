Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual回升 in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning hours, indicating persistent marine influence, before declining significantly as the day progressed, suggesting a reduction in fog and low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the afternoon, followed by a sustained increase through the evening, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind patterns shifted from strong northerly and westerly flows during the night to more variable and weaker conditions in the afternoon, with a brief surge from the west-southwest in the late afternoon. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment toward a drier, more stable, and potentially sunnier regime later in the day.
