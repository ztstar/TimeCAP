Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity reached saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating dense fog formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp, chilly feel. A slight increase in air pressure in the afternoon suggests the onset of a more stable atmospheric condition, potentially signaling the end of foggy conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions in the evening, which may have played a role in dispersing fog. Overall, the pattern reflects typical coastal marine influence, with overnight cooling, fog development, and a gradual clearing trend as the day progressed.
