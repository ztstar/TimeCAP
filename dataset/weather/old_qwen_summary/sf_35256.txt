Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Wind speeds remained minimal through the night, with near-zero values suggesting calm conditions conducive to fog formation and retention. A shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly flow coincided with the temperature recovery and a slight rise in air pressure, signaling a potential stabilization of the atmospheric pattern. The combination of high humidity, low wind, and temperature fluctuations suggests a high likelihood of coastal fog persisting into the coming hours, particularly in low-lying and bay-adjacent areas.
