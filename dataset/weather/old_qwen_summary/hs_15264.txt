Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly as temperatures climbed, indicating a shift toward drier air. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night, with a slight rise in the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought relatively calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that shifted slightly more westerly in the late afternoon, likely contributing to the drying trend. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, stable night to a warmer, drier day, which may reduce the likelihood of precipitation but could increase heat discomfort during peak daytime hours.
