Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating diurnal temperature variation typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during midday, only to surge again in the late evening—suggesting the influence of a nocturnal boundary layer and possible moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight increase during the afternoon may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which could indicate a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, unstable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with potential for clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day.
