Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, indicating a period of moist air followed by drier conditions. A notable increase in air pressure was observed during the early morning, peaking around dawn, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, shifting from northerly to southerly and then to a strong southwesterly direction, which may have contributed to the drying trend and temperature rise. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more unstable environment, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
