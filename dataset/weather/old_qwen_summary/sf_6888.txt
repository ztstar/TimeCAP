Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which began to dissipate as temperatures rose and winds increased in the afternoon. Air pressure showed a slight decline during the night, followed by stabilization, consistent with a weak low-pressure system lingering offshore or a passing front. Wind speeds were minimal during the peak hours of fog formation, but increased notably in the late afternoon, likely aiding in the dispersion of fog and improving air circulation. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southwest to more variable and eventually southwesterly suggests changing airflow patterns, potentially signaling a transition in weather conditions.
