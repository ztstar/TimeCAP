Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed pronounced fluctuations, with sustained high values during the early morning and late evening, indicating periods of fog or low-level cloud formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable but exhibited a sharp rise in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the influence of an approaching high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases accompanied by shifts in wind direction, particularly from the southwest and west, which may have contributed to the movement of marine air into the region. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal marine weather pattern, with foggy mornings and clearing skies in the afternoon, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
