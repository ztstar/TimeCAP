Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, signaling possible storm development or approaching frontal activity. The wind shift to the southwest and sustained higher speeds in the late evening may indicate the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Overall, the combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind patterns suggests a heightened risk of thunderstorms or precipitation in the near term.
