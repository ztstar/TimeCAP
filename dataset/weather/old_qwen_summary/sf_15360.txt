Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from nocturnal to diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the early morning, followed by a sustained period of stable pressure, suggesting a high-pressure system influencing the area and contributing to the clearing skies later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly directions, with a marked increase in speed during the late afternoon, potentially signaling the arrival of a sea breeze or a change in synoptic conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, stable coastal environment to a drier, more ventilated atmosphere, which may lead to improved visibility and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
