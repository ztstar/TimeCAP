Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, stabilizing in the cooler range before gradually rising slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with notable spikes during early morning and midday hours, indicating prolonged moisture presence likely due to marine influence. Air pressure exhibited a slight upward trend during the night, suggesting the gradual approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, driven by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the west and northwest—consistent with coastal upwelling patterns. The combination of cool temperatures, elevated humidity, and variable but moderate winds suggests a persistent marine layer, contributing to foggy conditions and a generally damp, cool feel across the city.
