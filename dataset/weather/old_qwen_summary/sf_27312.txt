Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the early hours. A steady high-pressure system was evident through stable air pressure values, indicating relatively calm and clear conditions once the fog lifted. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the night and early morning, but increased slightly in the afternoon, possibly due to a shift in wind direction from the north to the east and southeast. These conditions suggest a transition from a cool, foggy night to a drier, more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s coastal microclimate.
