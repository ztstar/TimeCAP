Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature rise in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a significant warming trend that likely reflects the influence of daytime solar heating and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels showed a striking pattern, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours followed by a steady decline through the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure exhibited a dip during the mid to late night, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent stabilization. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially setting the stage for increased instability and the possibility of convective activity later in the day.
