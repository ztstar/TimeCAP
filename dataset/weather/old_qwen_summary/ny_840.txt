Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged sharply during the same period, indicating the arrival of moist air, likely associated with a frontal passage. Air pressure remained stable until late evening, when it began to rise, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds diminished significantly throughout the night, with calm conditions prevailing in the middle of the period, followed by a resurgence in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northwest. These changes collectively point to the passage of a weather front, currently transitioning into more stable and drier conditions, which could lead to improved visibility and a potential end to any lingering precipitation.
