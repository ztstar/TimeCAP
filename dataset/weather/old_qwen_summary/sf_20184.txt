Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, with values consistently near or at 100%, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation and reduced visibility, especially during early morning hours. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing in the afternoon, reflecting typical coastal cooling patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics. Air pressure remained stable with a slight upward trend toward the end of the period, suggesting the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases during midday and early evening, while wind direction shifted dramatically from northwest to southeast and back, signaling a change in air mass and possible onshore flow. These conditions point to a persistent marine layer with potential for fog development and mild temperatures, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly in the early morning and overnight hours.
