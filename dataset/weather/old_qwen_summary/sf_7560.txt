Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of significant weather systems passing through, consistent with a calm, high-pressure regime. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction midday that likely contributed to the dispersion of fog and the transition in air mass. Overall, the conditions reflect a typical stable coastal pattern, with nighttime cooling and fog formation giving way to clearer skies and warmer temperatures during the day.
