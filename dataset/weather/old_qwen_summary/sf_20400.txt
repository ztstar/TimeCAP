Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation in the early morning and persisting at near-100% through mid-morning, indicating prolonged moisture presence and potential for fog formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south and then to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in air mass flow. These conditions collectively point to a stable, moist, and cooling environment conducive to dense fog, especially in coastal and low-lying areas, which may impact visibility and travel.
