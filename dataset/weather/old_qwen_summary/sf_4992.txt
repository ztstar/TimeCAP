Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, commonly seen in the region during marine layer events. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system or the influence of a coastal front. Wind patterns were highly variable, with periods of calm and shifts in direction, particularly from westerly to southerly, which may have contributed to the transport of moist marine air inland. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and variable winds points to an active marine layer and potential for fog or drizzle, especially during early morning hours, which could affect visibility and commute conditions.
