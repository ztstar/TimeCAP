Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained persistently high, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog formation, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, reflecting dynamic atmospheric changes likely tied to the approaching weather system. These combined factors suggest the potential for continued foggy conditions and possible light rain, especially in the coastal and lower-lying areas, with a heightened chance of overcast skies through the night.
