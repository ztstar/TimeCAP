Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling event likely driven by clear skies and increased wind activity. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking near saturation during the late night and early morning, which suggests elevated moisture levels conducive to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a marked decline through the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late morning, a pattern often associated with the passage of a low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and overnight, with sustained gusts from the southeast to south-southwest, contributing to the cooling trend and potentially signaling dynamic atmospheric changes. The shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and later to northwest in the pre-dawn hours suggests a change in air mass, possibly indicating the arrival of a cold front or a shift in synoptic-scale flow.
