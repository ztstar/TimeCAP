Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning to decline, indicating the presence of marine influence and potential fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase during the night, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, clear conditions later in the day. Wind activity remained minimal until mid-morning, when sustained winds from the west-southwest began, likely driven by coastal dynamics, with stronger gusts observed in the late afternoon. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a high likelihood of fog or low clouds, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which could impact visibility and morning commutes.
