Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, remaining elevated through the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then dropped noticeably in the late afternoon before rebounding, which may signal the passage of a weak weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning hours, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, potentially indicating the influence of local topography and sea breeze development. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a likely foggy or overcast morning, transitioning into clearer, drier conditions by evening.
