Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the night and early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed slight fluctuations, suggesting minimal large-scale weather system movement, though a minor drop in the early morning may have coincided with the onset of fog. Wind speeds were moderate during the day but increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with consistent easterly to northeasterly flow, reinforcing coastal cooling and fog advection. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the early morning hours may signal the beginning of a change in air mass, potentially bringing warmer and drier conditions later in the day.
