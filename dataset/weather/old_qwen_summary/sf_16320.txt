Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s coastal climate characteristics. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the afternoon, suggesting the possible approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, which often correlates with marine layer development. The overall pattern reflects typical coastal dynamics, with nocturnal cooling, fog formation, and variable wind patterns reinforcing the region's temperate, maritime climate.
