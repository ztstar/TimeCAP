Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained low throughout the evening and early morning, increasing slightly during the late night and early morning hours before dropping again as temperatures rose, suggesting dry air infiltration. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the night and early morning, peaking mid-morning, followed by a gradual decline, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system moving out and a low-pressure system approaching. Wind speeds were higher during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to northwest and eventually northeast, indicating a change in airflow associated with the weather system transition. The combination of cooling temperatures, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests the arrival of a new weather system, potentially bringing clouds, precipitation, or stronger winds in the coming hours.
