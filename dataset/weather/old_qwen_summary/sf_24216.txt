Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-morning. Humidity levels showed marked variability, peaking in the early hours and then decreasing, suggesting the influence of a shifting moisture layer, possibly linked to fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure declined steadily through the evening and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system through the region. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and onshore flow patterns typical of the area. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, falling pressure, and strong, variable winds points to dynamic coastal weather conditions, likely contributing to foggy and breezy mornings, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
