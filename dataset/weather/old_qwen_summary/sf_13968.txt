Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, plummeting to very low values during the overnight period before spiking significantly in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a marine layer or fog formation as moisture returned. Air pressure fluctuated with a distinct peak in the middle of the night, followed by a drop and subsequent stabilization, signaling a passing weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns revealed a shift from light, variable winds to stronger, consistent flow from the west-southwest during the early morning, which likely contributed to the mixing of marine air and the formation of fog. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal transition in San Francisco, where maritime influences dominate, bringing cool, foggy mornings and warming afternoons, with potential for visibility challenges and cooler temperatures early in the day.
