Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before rapidly increasing in the morning, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar warming. Humidity remained elevated during the early hours, peaking during the night, then dropped sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the onset of drying conditions following a period of moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily declined through the late night and early morning, hinting at an approaching weather system, though it stabilized and slightly rebounded later in the day. Wind activity increased significantly during the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass influence, particularly from the southwest and later from the southeast. These combined indicators point to a transition from a stable, humid nocturnal regime to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially signaling a shift in weather patterns with implications for precipitation and comfort levels.
