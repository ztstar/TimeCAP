Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front and subsequent recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure during the night, particularly in the early hours, aligns with the arrival of a low-pressure system, likely contributing to the enhanced humidity and wind activity. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, coming from the south and west, which is typical of coastal upwelling and marine layer development. The shift in wind direction toward the northwest and northeast in the morning, accompanied by a return to stable pressure, signals the dissipation of the low-pressure influence and a return to more typical coastal patterns.
