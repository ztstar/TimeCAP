Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late evening, with sustained strong winds from the west and northwest giving way to calmer conditions and a change in direction toward the southeast and northeast. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the final hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from stable, fog-prone conditions to potentially more dynamic weather, possibly including rain or stronger winds later tonight.
