Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but generally remained stable, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a brief rise was observed midday. Wind conditions were mostly light with frequent periods of calm, except for a brief increase in speed and a shift in direction during the late afternoon, hinting at possible local circulation changes. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests the potential for foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
