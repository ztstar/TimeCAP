Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to elevated dew points and a muggy feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight drop toward the end of the period may hint at an approaching change in weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow during the night and early morning, shifting to more easterly and northeasterly directions in the late afternoon—potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the conditions suggest a warm, humid environment with stable atmospheric pressure and shifting wind patterns, which may lay the groundwork for potential afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient daytime heating and moisture convergence occur.
