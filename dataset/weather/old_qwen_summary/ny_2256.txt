Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours and remaining high through midday, indicating a saturated atmosphere that may have contributed to fog or low visibility. Air pressure followed a distinct pattern, rising through the night and early morning before steadily decreasing in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with stronger gusts during the early and late periods, particularly from the northwest and west, which likely enhanced cooling and influenced air mass movement. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south in the late afternoon points to a change in airflow, potentially signaling an oncoming frontal passage with possible precipitation later in the day.
