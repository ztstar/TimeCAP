Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling period overnight succeeded by daytime recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could have contributed to fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air from the Atlantic. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, possibly leading to the development of showers or scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
