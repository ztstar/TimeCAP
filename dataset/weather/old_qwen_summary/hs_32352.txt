Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the daytime, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, suggesting the presence of a persistent high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest and later northwest, signaling a change in airflow that may reflect the influence of a passing frontal boundary. This combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds points to a transition toward a more stable and potentially clearer afternoon and evening, with reduced chances of precipitation.
