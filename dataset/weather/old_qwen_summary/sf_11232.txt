Temperature trends indicate a significant cooling during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles and possible fog development. Humidity levels show a marked spike during early morning hours, aligning with the lowest temperatures and indicating conditions favorable for fog formation, which is common in San Francisco’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-afternoon before slightly declining, signaling a high-pressure system moving in and stabilizing conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight but intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast, potentially indicating a change in airflow due to evolving pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns suggests a likelihood of fog or low clouds persisting into the evening, particularly near the coast.
