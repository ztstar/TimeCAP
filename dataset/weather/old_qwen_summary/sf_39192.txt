Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with multiple periods of saturation, especially during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation and condensation events. A notable drop in air pressure occurred midday, coinciding with sustained high wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, signaling the passage of a weather front. The persistent high winds and changing wind patterns, particularly in the afternoon and evening, point to dynamic atmospheric conditions, likely driven by a coastal low-pressure system interacting with local topography. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, fog-prone humidity, dropping pressure, and strong, shifting winds—indicate an unstable and transitional weather regime, with potential for continued gusty conditions and localized fog through the remainder of the day.
