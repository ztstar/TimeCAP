Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and morning periods before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a higher level during the day, which is indicative of an approaching high-pressure system bringing stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, with a quiet period during the night and early morning, followed by a modest increase in the late afternoon, likely due to local thermal effects. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and potential influences from the Pacific Ocean, all contributing to the formation and dissipation of coastal fog.
