Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery during the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage followed by mild warming. Humidity levels remained low to moderate overnight, sharply increasing in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting a surge in moisture possibly linked to a shifting air mass. Air pressure exhibited a consistent rise, culminating in a significant spike midday, which typically signals the approach and passage of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a notable increase in the evening and a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and west, consistent with the influence of a developing high-pressure ridge. These patterns collectively suggest improving weather conditions, with drier, clearer skies likely ahead, reducing the risk of precipitation and enhancing overall comfort by late day.
