Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point in the early morning hours before gradually rising during the afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, which may have contributed to a noticeable dampness and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate to low, with a notable calm period around dawn, followed by renewed breezes in the late morning and early evening, particularly from the north and east sectors. The shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and then to southerly suggests a dynamic atmospheric adjustment, likely associated with the approach of a frontal boundary, which could signal a change in weather patterns in the coming hours.
