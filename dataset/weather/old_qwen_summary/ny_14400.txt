Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a gradually warming day. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting clearing skies and a diminishing chance of precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the early morning hours, stabilizing before rising further in the afternoon, which is typically associated with improving weather conditions and the movement of a high-pressure system.
