Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before sharply dropping, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a notable drop in the late evening, potentially signaling a changing weather system approaching the region. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These conditions point to a transition from a foggy, calm morning to a drier, breezier afternoon, which may contribute to improving visibility and a more comfortable overall feel despite the temperature rise.
