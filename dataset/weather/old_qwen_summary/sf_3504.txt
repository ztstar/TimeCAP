Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, peaking during early morning hours and plummeting in the afternoon, consistent with the dissipation of marine layer fog as temperatures rose. Air pressure exhibited a significant increase mid-evening, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the afternoon, possibly signaling changes in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a warmer, drier, and more stable atmosphere, typical of a typical San Francisco afternoon pattern.
