Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Temperatures showed a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a slow recovery in the afternoon, suggesting a stable marine layer influence. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a notable rise midday and subsequent drop, signaling the passage of a weather system, possibly a weak front. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, reinforcing the arrival of stronger onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern, with potential for fog, cool temperatures, and breezy conditions affecting visibility and outdoor activities.
