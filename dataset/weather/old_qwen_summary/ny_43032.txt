Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong warming trend likely driven by increasing solar insolation and changing air mass dynamics. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions, possibly linked to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, pointing to the influence of a low-pressure system or frontal passage that may have brought earlier precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the morning and early afternoon, with a shift in direction from easterly to southerly and later to westerly, indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow that could enhance warming and dispersal of pollutants. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and shifting wind direction suggests a transition toward clearer skies and potentially warmer conditions in the near term, which may influence urban heat perception and outdoor activity planning.
