Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or mist during the early morning hours, reducing visibility. Air pressure remained stable through the night, then began a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late afternoon, particularly from the northeast, possibly signaling a shift in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a growing likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
