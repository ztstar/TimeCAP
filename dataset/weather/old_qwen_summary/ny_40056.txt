Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and continued through the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or mist, reducing visibility. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds were initially moderate but intensified in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a change in air mass, possibly from the south or southwest. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable night into a warmer, drier, and more dynamic day, likely resulting in improved daytime conditions with clearer skies.
