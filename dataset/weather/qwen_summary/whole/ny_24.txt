Temperature showed a steady rise during the day, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining, indicating a warming trend followed by nighttime cooling. Humidity levels remained low in the early hours, then surged dramatically after midday, reaching saturation overnight, suggesting the onset of precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a gradual increase during midday, signaling favorable conditions for stable weather, though a slight drop later may indicate an approaching disturbance. Wind speed was minimal in the morning, increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, and then declined slightly, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and increasing wind suggests the possibility of inclement weather, including rain or overcast conditions, in the near term.
