Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, likely driven by nocturnal heat loss and changing air mass influences. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before gradually decreasing, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a downward trend in the middle of the period, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or front through the region. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with consistent easterly to northerly flow shifting toward more variable directions in the latter half, potentially indicating a change in synoptic-scale wind patterns. These combined factors suggest the weather has been trending toward more stable, moist conditions with possible implications for morning fog and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
