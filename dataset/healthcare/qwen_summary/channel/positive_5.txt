- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half, suggesting increasing respiratory influenza activity. A notable peak occurred in the most recent weeks, followed by a marked decline, indicating a possible waning phase of the current seasonal surge. This pattern implies a typical seasonal influenza trajectory, with implications for healthcare system preparedness and the timing of public health interventions.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a pronounced upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half of the period, suggesting a significant surge in influenza A activity. A clear peak was reached in the 18th week, followed by a substantial decline, indicating the potential waning of the current outbreak or the onset of a post-peak phase. This pattern reflects a typical epidemic curve, underscoring the need for sustained surveillance and preparedness to mitigate potential resurgence or secondary waves.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the final quarter, suggesting a rapidly growing influenza B activity. A notable inflection point occurs around week 13, followed by a peak and subsequent decline, indicating a possible epidemic peak and early signs of waning transmission. The magnitude of increase and the high levels observed in recent weeks highlight an urgent need for enhanced surveillance, public health preparedness, and potential intervention strategies.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the final months, suggesting a significant and escalating influenza circulation. A peak was reached in the most recent weeks, followed by a notable decline, indicating possible waning of the current wave or the onset of seasonal abatement. The pattern reflects a typical respiratory virus epidemic curve, with implications for healthcare preparedness and the need for continued surveillance to detect potential resurgences.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator has shown a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the final quarter, indicating a significant and growing burden of influenza A in respiratory specimens. A notable peak occurred in the most recent weeks, followed by a pronounced decline, suggesting the potential onset of a post-peak phase or the waning of the current wave. This pattern implies heightened transmission during the peak period, with possible implications for healthcare system preparedness and the need for continued surveillance to detect any resurgence.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a steady upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final seven weeks, suggesting a significant and sustained increase in influenza B activity. A sharp rise from mid-week 14 onward indicates the onset of a peak phase, likely signaling the height of the current influenza season. This trend underscores an urgent need for heightened surveillance, resource allocation, and public health messaging to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
