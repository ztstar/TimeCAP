Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early hours when temperatures were lowest. Air pressure exhibited a sharp decline in the early morning, followed by a dramatic increase, signaling the passage of a cold front that brought a rapid shift in conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the northwest to west sectors, consistent with post-frontal outflow. The combination of falling temperatures, high humidity, and strong winds likely led to cold, damp conditions and potential for wind chill, affecting outdoor comfort and travel in New York City.
