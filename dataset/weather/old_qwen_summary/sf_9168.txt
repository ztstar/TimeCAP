Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the cooler hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the potential for fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, with a notable rise in the mid-morning and again in the late afternoon, indicating shifting weather systems, possibly a high-pressure buildup influencing the area. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but increased slightly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, signaling a possible change in air mass. These conditions point to a transition from a damp, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable regime, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day.
