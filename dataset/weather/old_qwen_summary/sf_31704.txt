Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing and gradually rising again. Humidity remained near saturation during the early hours, indicating dense fog or low cloud cover, which gradually cleared as temperatures climbed and humidity dropped in the late afternoon. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the final hours, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable but predominantly westerly and southwesterly wind directions, consistent with coastal airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, stable maritime layer to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled atmosphere, possibly heralding shifts in weather later in the day.
