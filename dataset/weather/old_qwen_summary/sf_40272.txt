Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high until midday, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, then dropped abruptly in the mid-afternoon, indicating a possible change in weather systems.
