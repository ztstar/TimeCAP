Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a pronounced spike in the late morning, which may signal the approach or passage of a high-pressure system. Wind patterns were variable, with periods of calm and intermittent gusts, particularly from the southeast and southwest, potentially indicating shifting low-level wind dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition phase in Houston’s weather, with the potential for clearing skies later in the day but possible residual moisture that could lead to isolated showers.
