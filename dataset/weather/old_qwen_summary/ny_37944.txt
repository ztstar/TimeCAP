Over the past 24 hours, temperatures remained consistently low, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the night and early morning before declining sharply, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or precipitation event. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may signal a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, cooler air mass to a drier, stabilizing one, likely resulting in improving conditions with reduced chances of precipitation.
