Temperatures exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a gradual recovery during the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, then declined sharply as temperatures began to rise, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more settled conditions. Wind speeds remained low until mid-morning, when a brief surge occurred, followed by a return to lighter winds, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a drier, stable day, consistent with the arrival of fair weather conditions in New York City.
