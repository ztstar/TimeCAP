Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming day. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly in the overnight and pre-dawn hours, suggesting saturated air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend, with minor fluctuations, indicating steady atmospheric conditions without evidence of an approaching storm system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and afternoon, with sustained moderate to strong winds from the east and southeast, which may have contributed to the gradual temperature rise and enhanced air mixing. The shift in wind direction from the south and east toward the northeast in the evening suggests a possible change in air mass, potentially signaling the approach of a more dynamic weather pattern in the coming hours.
