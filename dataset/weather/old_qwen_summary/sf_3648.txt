Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the core nighttime hours, suggesting calm conditions, but increased in the late evening, particularly from the northwest and later the southwest, signaling a shift in wind patterns. The combination of dropping pressure, elevated humidity, and changing wind direction points to an ongoing transition toward potentially more dynamic weather, including the possibility of light rain or drizzle in the near term.
