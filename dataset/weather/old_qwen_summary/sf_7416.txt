Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures climbed. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, reaching a peak that coincides with the stabilization of weather conditions and a shift toward clearer skies. Wind speeds remained consistently low during the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a steady easterly to southeasterly wind direction, indicating a weakening of coastal upwelling. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a transient weather system, likely a shift from marine influence to more stable continental air, leading to improving visibility and warmer, drier conditions in the evening.
