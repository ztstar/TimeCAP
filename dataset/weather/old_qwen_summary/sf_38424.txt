Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating a saturated atmosphere likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. Temperature remained stable through the early morning hours before showing a gradual rise in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in thermal conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slight decline, signaling a transition in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were moderate to strong overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the afternoon, which may reflect changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. This combination of high humidity, rising temperature, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day.
