Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, with winds transitioning from a southerly to a northeasterly flow, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly during the final six hours, suggesting the approach of a more dynamic weather system. The rise in air pressure during the early part of the period and its stabilization later indicate a high-pressure influence, but the combination of variable winds, high humidity, and temperature fluctuations may signal an impending shift toward more unstable conditions.
