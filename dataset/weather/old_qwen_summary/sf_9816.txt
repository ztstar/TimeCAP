Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of higher activity, and wind direction shifted notably in the early morning, possibly signaling a change in airflow patterns. The combination of falling pressure, dropping humidity, and variable winds suggests an increasing likelihood of changing weather, potentially bringing cloud changes or precipitation later in the day.
