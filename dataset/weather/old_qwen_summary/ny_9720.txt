Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early and late hours, with a notable increase during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds varied, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted from northwest to southwest, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation and improving visibility in the coming hours.
