Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, paired with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, hinting at a change in air mass. These conditions point to a stable, dry, and gradually warming environment, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and favoring clear skies in the near term.
