Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the day, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more dynamic air. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally light during the early hours but intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the northeast and east, consistent with an approaching frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast and then to the southeast indicates changing air masses, potentially setting the stage for unsettled weather in the coming hours.
