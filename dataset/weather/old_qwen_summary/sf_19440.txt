Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating a saturated atmosphere likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Temperature remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the day, suggesting a slow warming trend as the sun rose and afternoon heating occurred. Air pressure showed a steady rise, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to more southerly and then westerly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns and possible katabatic or coastal influences. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy morning to a slightly warmer, drier afternoon, with improving conditions expected in the near term.
