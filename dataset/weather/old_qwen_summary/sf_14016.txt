Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a persistent cool and damp feel, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, suggesting the influence of a developing weather system, though pressure rebounded later in the evening. Wind activity intensified during the early morning and late afternoon, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and west, likely enhancing coastal fog dispersion and moisture transport. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating wind patterns, and lingering humidity indicates a transition toward more variable conditions, potentially signaling the arrival of a changeable weather pattern in the coming hours.
