Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining high, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or drizzle. A notable drop in air pressure occurred through the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then more northerly, consistent with changing storm dynamics. These combined indicators point to a developing weather pattern that may bring precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
