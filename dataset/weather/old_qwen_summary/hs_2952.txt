Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and elevated temperatures. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, starting moderate, dropping sharply during the midday, then rising again in the late evening, suggesting possible changes in air mass or localized moisture influx. A marked drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a sustained period of low pressure, which is often associated with unstable weather and potential for storm development. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a sudden shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating a possible frontal passage or changing circulation pattern. These combined signals point to an active weather transition, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or severe weather in the near term.
