Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours, with a sharp drop in moisture content during midday. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were lowest during the overnight hours, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly, potentially indicating a change in synoptic flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with implications for heat buildup and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
