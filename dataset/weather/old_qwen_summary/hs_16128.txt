Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly during the day, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and easterly patterns, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather feature. Overall, the data suggests a transition toward warmer, drier conditions with improving stability, though increased wind activity may contribute to localized heat dissipation and potential for gusty conditions.
