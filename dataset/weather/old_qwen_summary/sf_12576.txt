Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease in the midday, reaching a low before sharply increasing again during the night, indicating a change in air mass or the arrival of fog or marine layer conditions. Air pressure steadily rose, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, with stronger and more variable winds from the west and northwest, likely associated with offshore flow or a shift in regional wind patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy maritime influence to a drier, windier, and slightly warmer regime, typical of late morning to afternoon conditions in the city’s microclimate.
