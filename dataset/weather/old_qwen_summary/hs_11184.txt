Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. A significant drop in humidity occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon, suggesting potential moisture influx or localized convection. Air pressure exhibited a general upward trend, peaking in the late afternoon, which often signals improving or stable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with higher gusts and shifts in wind direction indicating possible changes in atmospheric circulation or the approach of a weather system. Combined with fluctuating wind directions and a sudden drop in humidity, these patterns may point to the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
