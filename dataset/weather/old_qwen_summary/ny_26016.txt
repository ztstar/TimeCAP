Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with a sharp rise during early morning hours followed by a gradual decrease, suggesting the influence of overnight condensation and subsequent drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cooler, moist night to a drier, more stable, and breezy day, consistent with improving conditions in New York City.
