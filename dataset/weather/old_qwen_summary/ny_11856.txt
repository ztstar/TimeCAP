Temperature trends indicate a steady overnight cooling followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the night and early morning, then began to rise again, indicating a drying trend likely associated with clearing skies. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night into early morning, followed by a stabilization and slight rise, signaling the aftermath of a low-pressure system moving out. Wind speeds decreased substantially overnight, with near-calm conditions during the early hours, but increased again in the late afternoon, likely due to a developing surface pressure gradient. Wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to a more variable pattern, reflecting changing air mass influences and potentially setting the stage for shifting weather conditions in the coming hours.
