Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming trend during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, then dropped during the day before increasing again in the late afternoon, suggesting possible moisture influx. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning hours, reaching a low before rebounding during the afternoon, which may indicate a passing weather system or storm front. Wind speeds intensified through the midday and early evening, with strong northerly and easterly winds coinciding with the pressure drop, likely contributing to cooler conditions and potential storm development. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind suggests an unstable atmosphere, raising the likelihood of precipitation or storms later in the day.
