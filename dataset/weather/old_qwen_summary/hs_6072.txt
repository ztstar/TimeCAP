Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating diurnal temperature variation typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a muggy feel and likely enhanced cloud formation. Air pressure showed fluctuations, with a notable drop during the early hours and a subsequent rise, suggesting possible passage of a weather system or front. Wind patterns were variable, with periods of calm and shifting directions, including a sustained southerly to easterly flow during the night and a shift toward more westerly and northerly winds in the late afternoon. These conditions together point to a transition period, possibly with the approach of a frontal boundary, which could lead to increased chances of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
