Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels surged to saturation in the early hours, suggesting dense fog formation, which likely persisted into the morning before dissipating as temperatures rose and winds shifted. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the final hours, hinting at a weak low-pressure influence approaching. Wind speeds increased during the early morning, particularly from a northwesterly direction, before weakening significantly by midday, with a notable shift in wind direction indicating changing flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and variable winds points to coastal fog and potentially cooler, damp conditions, which are typical of San Francisco’s microclimate but may impact visibility and outdoor activities.
