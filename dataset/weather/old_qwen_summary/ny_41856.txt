Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a milder day. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation just before dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass and possible influence from a developing weather system. These combined trends suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a moist, cool night into a more stable, moderately windy day, with conditions potentially conducive to clearing skies later in the period.
