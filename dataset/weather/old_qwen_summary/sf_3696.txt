Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the day warmed. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and midday, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which reflects the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system enhancing stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the night and early morning, decreasing during midday before increasing sharply in the evening, particularly from the southwest, consistent with a developing offshore flow. This combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates the clearing of marine layer conditions, leading to improving visibility and more stable, sunnier conditions approaching the evening.
