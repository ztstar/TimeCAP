Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more convective air. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with moist onshore flow that can fuel thunderstorm development. The combination of rising humidity, weakening pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened potential for afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the coming hours.
