Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation or low cloud cover. A gradual drop in air pressure throughout the night and into the morning suggests an approaching weather system, possibly bringing more persistent cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more westerly and northwesterly directions, consistent with marine layer dynamics. These conditions point to a strong marine influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and suggest the possibility of foggy or overcast conditions persisting into the next day.
