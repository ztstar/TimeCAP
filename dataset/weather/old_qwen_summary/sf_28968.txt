Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or dense moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with the observed increase in cloud cover and damp conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early hours, particularly from the southwest and south, then shifted to variable directions later, with a strong southerly component in the evening possibly bringing in maritime air. These combined factors point to a maritime influence typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with a high likelihood of foggy or overcast conditions persisting into the next period.
