Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening, particularly from the northwest and west, consistent with offshore flow or a developing sea breeze pattern. The shift in wind direction from westerly to northeasterly late at night suggests changing synoptic influences, possibly linked to a frontal passage or a shift in the coastal circulation.
