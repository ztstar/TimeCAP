Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels declined sharply through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before stabilizing at low levels, suggesting dry air dominance likely due to offshore flow or subsidence. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking mid-morning before gradually decreasing, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted notably around midday, with a strong increase in speed and a change in direction toward the southeast, potentially signaling the onset of a land-breeze or a shift in local circulation linked to the afternoon heating. These combined factors suggest a transition toward clearer skies and drier conditions, consistent with a strengthening high-pressure ridge influencing the area.
