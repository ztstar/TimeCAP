Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a slight increase in the afternoon, which may signal the influence of a developing high-pressure system, potentially bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds remained relatively moderate throughout, with a consistent northerly to easterly flow shifting toward a more southeasterly direction in the late afternoon, possibly facilitating moisture transport. These trends collectively suggest a transition toward warmer, drier conditions with improving air quality, though lingering humidity could support afternoon thunderstorm development.
