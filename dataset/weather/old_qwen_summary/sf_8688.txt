Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating the presence of moist air masses likely associated with marine influence. A notable spike in air pressure occurred midday, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then back to westerly, reflecting dynamic adjustments in local airflow. These conditions point to a mix of marine layer persistence and atmospheric stabilization, likely contributing to clear skies and mild temperatures in the city.
