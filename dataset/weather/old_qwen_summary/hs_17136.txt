Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated throughout the day, which contributes to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed minimal fluctuation, with a brief rise midday followed by a slight drop, suggesting the influence of a weak low-pressure system or minor atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather front. These combined indicators suggest a high likelihood of scattered thunderstorms or showers later in the day, particularly as moisture continues to accumulate and atmospheric conditions become more conducive to convection.
