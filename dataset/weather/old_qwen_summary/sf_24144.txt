Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, followed by a notable decrease in the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies or reduced moisture influx. A steady decline in air pressure during the early hours, followed by a rebound, points to a dynamic atmospheric system passing through, possibly associated with a low-pressure front. Wind speeds were highest during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, likely driven by coastal influences and topography. These combined factors suggest an active weather transition, with potential for fog dissipation and improving conditions later in the day.
