Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to potential fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure decreased steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and possibly the approach of a frontal boundary. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast, consistent with dynamic weather conditions associated with storm development or a passing cold front. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southeasterly and then to southerly suggests a change in airflow that could bring warmer, moister conditions, potentially leading to unstable weather later in the day.
