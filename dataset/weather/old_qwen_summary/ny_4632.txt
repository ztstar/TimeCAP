Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to a cold air mass moving into the region. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting atmospheric moisture accumulation. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening and overnight, with sustained stronger gusts, and wind direction shifted to more easterly and southerly sectors, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined factors point to the likelihood of precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term, particularly during the early morning hours.
