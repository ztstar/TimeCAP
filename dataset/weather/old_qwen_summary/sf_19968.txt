Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which suggests persistent moisture in the atmosphere and the potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained low and consistent, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing air flow patterns likely associated with the high-pressure buildup. These trends collectively point to a transition from foggy, cool, and moist conditions toward a drier, more stable, and gradually warming environment.
