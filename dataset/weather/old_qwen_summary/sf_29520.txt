Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before plummeting sharply, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the night but showed a notable increase in the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought drier, more stable air. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, with stronger gusts in the early hours, possibly driven by local topography and pressure gradients. These patterns collectively point to a coastal fog event that dissipated as the sun rose, leading to a warming trend and improved visibility, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
