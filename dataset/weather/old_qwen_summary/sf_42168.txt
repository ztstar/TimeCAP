Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation before declining in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that dissipated as the day warmed. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from strong westerly and northwesterly flows in the evening to more variable and weaker winds by midday, with a notable change to southerly and easterly directions in the late afternoon. These changes point to a transition from marine influence to more inland conditions, likely resulting in improving visibility and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
