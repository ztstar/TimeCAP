Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by clear skies and low wind speeds. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which suggests the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility during those times. Air pressure steadily increased through the early morning and into the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low at night, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly, possibly indicating a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and variable winds implies a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, though residual moisture could still support isolated showers later in the day.
