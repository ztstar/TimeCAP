Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler to warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, before sharply declining as temperatures rose. A notable pressure surge occurred in the late morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but began to increase slightly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and then later to the west and southwest. These combined patterns point to a gradual clearing trend and improved conditions, with the potential for partly cloudy skies and a more comfortable feel as the day progresses.
