Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure showed a complex pattern, with a notable drop in the early morning followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief bursts during the night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns, indicating changing airflow dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and low wind speeds points to favorable conditions for fog persistence, which may continue to affect visibility and commute conditions into the next period.
