Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable air conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the dissipation of coastal fog and improving conditions, consistent with a transition toward clearer skies and milder weather.
