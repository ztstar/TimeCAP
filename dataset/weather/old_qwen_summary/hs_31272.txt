Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to a damp and oppressive feel before a notable drying trend began in the late morning. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around dawn, with a sudden change in direction from southerly to westerly to northerly, accompanied by a brief spike in speed, indicating a possible frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime pattern, with potential for clearer skies and improved comfort as the system moves through.
