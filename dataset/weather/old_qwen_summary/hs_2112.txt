Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, reaching a low point before gradually rising, indicating the passage of a weather system, likely a frontal boundary. Temperature trends showed a nocturnal cooling phase followed by a gradual increase during the day, with a distinct temperature inversion observed overnight. Humidity remained elevated through the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which contributed to foggy conditions, before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly, consistent with the approach and passage of a cold front. These conditions collectively suggest the end of a humid, unstable period, with drier, cooler air now moving in, potentially bringing relief from previous heat and humidity.
