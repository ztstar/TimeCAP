Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend during the late morning and afternoon, followed by a return to cooler conditions in the evening. High humidity levels persisted through the night and early morning, reaching saturation and contributing to dense fog that likely reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and early morning, then increased again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more southerly and easterly. These conditions suggest a transition from a maritime-influenced, foggy environment toward a slightly drier and more variable regime, potentially signaling the approach of a changing weather system.
