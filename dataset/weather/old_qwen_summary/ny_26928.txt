Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked drop in temperature during the late evening and early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking before plummeting during midday, followed by a dramatic increase again at night—indicating possible precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a sustained decline through the night, stabilizing only in the early morning, which is consistent with low-pressure system influence and potential storm development. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, reinforcing the arrival of a frontal boundary. These combined signals suggest a dynamic and unstable atmosphere, with the potential for showers or thunderstorms, particularly in the overnight hours, warranting caution for outdoor activities and travel.
