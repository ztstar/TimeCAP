Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before stabilizing in the mid-evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the early morning hours, accompanied by consistent southerly to westerly wind directions, suggesting strong offshore flow that may have enhanced coastal cooling. Air pressure fluctuated with a distinct rise in the late evening, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, where marine air intrusion and topographic effects drive rapid changes in temperature, humidity, and wind.
