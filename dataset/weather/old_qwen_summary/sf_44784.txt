Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced consistently stable conditions across all key meteorological parameters. Temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction have remained virtually unchanged, indicating a prolonged period of atmospheric stagnation. The persistent low humidity and steady temperature suggest dry air with minimal thermal variation, characteristic of a high-pressure dome or subsidence inversion. The unvarying wind direction from the southeast implies a consistent airflow pattern, likely influenced by regional synoptic conditions such as a coastal high-pressure system. This lack of change in weather variables indicates a stable and settled weather regime, with little to no potential for precipitation or significant weather shifts in the near term.
