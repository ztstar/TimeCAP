Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Temperatures gradually declined through the night before stabilizing, suggesting a cooling trend associated with nocturnal radiative loss and marine air influence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the buildup of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly direction, with peak speeds observed during the late afternoon and early evening, possibly enhancing coastal upwelling and fog dispersion. These combined factors point to a transition from a foggy, cool maritime environment toward clearer skies and slightly more dynamic wind conditions as the high-pressure ridge strengthens.
