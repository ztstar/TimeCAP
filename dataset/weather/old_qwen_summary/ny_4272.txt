Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon. A marked increase in humidity occurred during the early hours, peaking around midnight before declining steadily, indicating possible moisture buildup and subsequent clearing. Air pressure showed a rise during the night, remaining elevated through the early morning, which suggests the influence of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds surged abruptly in the late night, with strong gusts from the northwest, tapering off by mid-morning and then reactivating in the afternoon, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. The erratic wind direction, particularly the shift toward northerly and westerly flows, combined with fluctuating humidity and pressure, points to a dynamic atmospheric transition that may precede changing weather patterns.
