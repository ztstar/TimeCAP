Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, likely due to the influx of cold air. Humidity levels showed a marked fluctuation, beginning moderate, dropping sharply in the early morning, then rising again, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible moisture accumulation. Air pressure rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking before stabilizing, which typically signals the approach and passage of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the northwest to west sectors, contributing to a chill factor and potentially increasing wind chill warnings. These combined patterns suggest a cold front has passed through, resulting in colder, drier, and windier conditions, which may lead to frost risk and discomfort for outdoor activities.
