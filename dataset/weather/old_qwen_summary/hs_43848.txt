Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during multiple periods, indicating the presence of moist air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from northeast to southeast and back, pointing to changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests a transition from a moist, unstable environment toward more settled weather, possibly reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
