Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high, hovering near saturation for much of the period, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a high likelihood of fog or drizzle during low-temperature phases. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northwestward in the early morning, indicative of a changing air mass and potential frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable conditions, but lingering high humidity and residual moisture could still support isolated showers later in the day.
