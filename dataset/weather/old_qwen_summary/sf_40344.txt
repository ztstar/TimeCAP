Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which suggests the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture advected from the Pacific. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a notable rise in the afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the influence of a high-pressure system approaching the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to southeast and then northwest, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition period in the weather, likely bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions by the coming day.
