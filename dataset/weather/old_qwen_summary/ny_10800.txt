Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual warming from early morning until midday, followed by a stabilization and slight decline, suggesting a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly in the early and late hours, signaling saturated air that may contribute to fog or drizzle. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late night, with sustained strong winds from the southwest and west, consistent with storm-related outflow. Combined, these indicators suggest a recent storm passage, with potential lingering effects such as overcast skies and a risk of light precipitation in the immediate hours ahead.
