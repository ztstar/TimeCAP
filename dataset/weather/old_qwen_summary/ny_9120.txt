Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced persistently high humidity levels, remaining near saturation for the first 14 hours before a significant drop, indicating a shift in air mass. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting a warming trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp drop in the late afternoon, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or frontal passages. Wind speeds remained low overall, except for a brief spike in the early morning, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and then southeasterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest the arrival of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing precipitation and unsettled weather in the near term.
