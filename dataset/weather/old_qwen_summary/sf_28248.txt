Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a notable fluctuation, peaking in the early hours and then declining, with a persistent drop during the late morning and afternoon. Air pressure exhibited a sharp drop in the early morning hours, followed by a prolonged period of low pressure, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind, and fluctuating humidity suggests the onset of a changing weather pattern, potentially bringing overcast conditions or light precipitation later in the day.
