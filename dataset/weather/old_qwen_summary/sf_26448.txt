Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a stark contrast, with high values in the early morning and late night, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the late evening, suggesting a cycle of fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning, then declined sharply in the afternoon—indicating a passing weather system that may have brought changeable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northerly and then easterly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather environment, likely influenced by marine layer movement and the interaction of onshore breezes with a developing low-pressure system.
