Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, suggesting the presence of nocturnal condensation and possible fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend overnight, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but increased in the afternoon, particularly from the east and southeast, which may have contributed to the warming trend and could indicate a shift in regional airflow. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly and then back to the east, hinting at a possible change in atmospheric circulation that might influence the development of afternoon thunderstorms.
