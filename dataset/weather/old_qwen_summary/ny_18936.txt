Temperature showed a steady increase throughout the day, indicating a warming trend that likely began during the night and continued through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaked in the late night, and then declined, suggesting a period of moisture accumulation followed by dissipation. Air pressure exhibited notable variability, with a sharp drop during the overnight hours, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined patterns point to a developing weather event, possibly a frontal passage, which could lead to unsettled conditions such as precipitation or storms later in the day.
