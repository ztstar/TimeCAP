Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near 100%, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight decline toward the end, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system that could allow for increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift to more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late evening, accompanied by a consistent northerly to westerly wind direction, typical of marine layer influence. These conditions suggest a persistent marine layer that is likely responsible for the cool, foggy mornings and stable, overcast conditions, with potential for continued coastal fog into the coming hours.
