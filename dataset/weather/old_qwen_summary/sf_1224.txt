Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of marine fog or low cloud cover typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the morning and late evening, with shifting directions suggesting variable flow patterns, possibly driven by local topography and sea-breeze effects. The combination of moderate warming, decreasing wind, and stable high pressure points to a transition toward more settled and potentially sunny weather in the coming hours.
