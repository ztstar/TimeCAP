Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the day but surged significantly during the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover consistent with the region’s coastal climate. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-day, particularly during the transition from night to morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and decreased substantially through the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and possible influence from local topography. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer to a drier, warmer, and more variable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
