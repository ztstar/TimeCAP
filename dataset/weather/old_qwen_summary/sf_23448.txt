Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual recovery, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained light to moderate, with a notable decrease during the night and a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, suggesting a change in airflow that may be linked to the high-pressure buildup. These patterns suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and moist period to a clearer and drier afternoon, characteristic of typical San Francisco microclimate behavior.
