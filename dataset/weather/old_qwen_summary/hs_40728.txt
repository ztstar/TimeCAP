Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly, indicating the influence of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing airflow patterns near the surface. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, with potential for clearing skies and improved air quality later in the day.
