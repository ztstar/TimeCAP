Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from a cold, stable air mass to a milder one. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with deteriorating weather. Wind speeds decreased substantially after midnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, suggesting a change in the steering flow of the system. These combined trends point to the arrival of a moist, unsettled weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
