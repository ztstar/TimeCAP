Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early and late hours, peaking in the early morning and mid-morning, then dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting a shift in air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a brief recovery, indicating possible atmospheric instability or the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially during the midday and late afternoon, particularly in the evening, with a marked shift in wind direction from west-southwest to southeast, hinting at a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the arrival of a maritime influence or a developing coastal low-pressure system, likely contributing to overcast conditions and a damp, cool feel across the city.
