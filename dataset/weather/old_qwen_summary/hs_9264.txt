Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and declined sharply during the afternoon before gradually increasing again in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass during midday hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a recovery later in the evening, which may signal the passage of a weather system or a developing low-pressure area. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with a brief increase in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then abruptly turned to northerly late in the evening—potentially signaling a change in air flow patterns. These combined trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric shift, possibly indicating approaching weather changes such as potential thunderstorm development or a frontal passage in the coming hours.
