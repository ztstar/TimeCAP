Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise in temperature through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, indicating the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation, likely due to overnight condensation and reduced mixing. A notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northerly sectors suggests the influence of a passing frontal system, accompanied by fluctuating wind speeds that intensified during midday. Air pressure showed a slight overall increase, with brief dips during periods of higher humidity and wind, consistent with dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These patterns point to a developing weather transition, potentially signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure system, which could lead to clearing skies and reduced humidity in the coming hours.
