Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that has since dissipated. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a steady decline, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night and early morning, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially stormy or unstable weather.
