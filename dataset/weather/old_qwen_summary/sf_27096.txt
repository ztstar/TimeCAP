Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the early hours of the day, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds in coastal areas. A notable rise in air pressure occurred mid-morning and again in the late evening, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief increase in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from offshore to more southerly and eventually westerly, suggesting a change in flow patterns possibly linked to coastal dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day, with reduced fog potential and improved visibility.
