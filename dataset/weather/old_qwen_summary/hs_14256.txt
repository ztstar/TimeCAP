Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a low-level moisture surge that may have contributed to increased fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a recovery, which may reflect the passage of a weak frontal boundary or a local pressure system influencing the region. Wind patterns were generally light and variable overnight, with a brief increase in gustiness in the late afternoon and evening, potentially indicating a shift in local circulation or a developing convection. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and increasing wind activity suggests a rising potential for thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
