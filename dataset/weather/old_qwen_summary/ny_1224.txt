Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping during midday, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a drier, more stable daytime pattern, likely leading to improved visibility and fair skies in the coming hours.
