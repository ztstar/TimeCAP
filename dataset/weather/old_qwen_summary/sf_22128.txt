Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly as temperatures increased and winds calmed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions, potentially linked to an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief period of calmness around dawn, and wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These trends point to a transition in the local weather regime, possibly signaling the arrival of a maritime influence or a change in the synoptic-scale pressure pattern.
