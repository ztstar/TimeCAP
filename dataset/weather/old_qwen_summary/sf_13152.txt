Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system, though a minor drop toward the end of the period may signal changing dynamics. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, then decreased to near calm conditions during the midday, before increasing again in the evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These trends suggest a coastal fog event that dissipated as the day progressed, consistent with San Francisco’s typical diurnal weather cycle, with potential for clearing skies and improving visibility in the coming hours.
