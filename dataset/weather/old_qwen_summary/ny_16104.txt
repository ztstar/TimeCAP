Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily rose from early morning lows to peak in the afternoon, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar radiation. Humidity levels exhibited a notable increase during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a significant drop during the day, suggesting a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating the absence of strong frontal systems passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Collectively, these patterns suggest a transition from a moist, cooler night to a warmer, drier daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the near term.
