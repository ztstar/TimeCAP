Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, then declined significantly through the day, suggesting a shift toward drier air as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no clear low-pressure system development, which implies mostly stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were light in the early period but increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow becoming more pronounced. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds may contribute to increased fire weather risk and could signal the approach of a drier, more stable air mass or a developing sea breeze circulation.
