Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by coastal fog dissipation and afternoon solar heating. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight and early morning hours, aligning with the temperature minimum, before plummeting dramatically as temperatures rose, suggesting fog or low cloud dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a gradual decline into the late afternoon, hinting at the possible influence of a weakening weather system or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in coastal airflow patterns. This combination of rapid temperature swings, dropping humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition from a foggy, marine-influenced condition to a drier, more stable afternoon regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
