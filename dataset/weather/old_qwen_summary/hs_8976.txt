Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which created conditions conducive to fog and low visibility. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to a more southerly direction in the late evening, possibly signaling a change in air mass, with wind speeds remaining generally light to moderate. The combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, cool overnight period to a warming, drier daytime pattern, with potential for clearing skies and improved conditions in the coming hours.
