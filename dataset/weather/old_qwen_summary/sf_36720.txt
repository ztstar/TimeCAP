Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in multiple periods, especially during the pre-dawn and mid-morning, indicating moisture-laden air associated with the system. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the early hours, with strong gusts from the northeast and east, suggesting frontal passage and potential for turbulent conditions. The temperature remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend during the night, consistent with cooling under overcast and moist conditions. These indicators collectively point to a weather event involving coastal fog, possible drizzle or light rain, and changing wind patterns typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
