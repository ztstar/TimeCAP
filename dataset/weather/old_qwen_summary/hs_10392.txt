Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend with limited daytime warming. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking near saturation, which suggests high moisture content in the air and favorable conditions for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, reaching a peak just before dawn, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief increases during the mid-morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction suggesting localized atmospheric adjustments. These combined patterns point to a transition toward clearer skies and drier air, though lingering moisture may still contribute to a muggy feel in the early hours.
