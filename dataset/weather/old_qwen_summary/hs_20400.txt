Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, indicating drier air, which may have contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, likely bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently strong, particularly during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast, suggesting a change in air mass flow. The combination of cooling temperatures, decreasing humidity, increasing pressure, and northeasterly winds points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, reducing the likelihood of precipitation or thunderstorms.
