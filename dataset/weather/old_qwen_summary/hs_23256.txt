Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nighttime to daytime thermal patterns. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before moderating, suggesting increased moisture availability that may contribute to potential afternoon cloud development or thunderstorm activity. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, implying a lack of strong frontal influence and a generally stable atmospheric environment. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction toward the southeast, which may indicate the onset of a sea breeze or localized convective circulation. Combined, these conditions suggest a high likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms, particularly given the warm, moist air mass and increasing wind energy.
