Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a maximum before declining during the afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and remained elevated, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to more southerly, consistent with inflow associated with a developing weather disturbance. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm development or precipitation in the near term, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours.
