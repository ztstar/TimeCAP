Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased sharply in the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing local circulation patterns, possibly linked to a coastal breeze cycle. These dynamics point to a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone environment to a drier, more stable regime, with implications for visibility, temperature comfort, and potential for developing afternoon sea breezes.
