Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking and remaining near saturation through the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling the absence of significant storm systems, though a slight drop toward the end of the period may hint at subtle atmospheric changes. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning and again in the late evening, with consistent westerly to northwesterly flow, reinforcing the dominance of coastal upwelling and maritime air advection. These conditions collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern—cool, foggy mornings transitioning into clearer, mild afternoons—favoring marine layer persistence and potential for afternoon cloud break.
