Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, particularly in low-lying areas and coastal zones. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, except for a brief spike in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a possible change in air mass. These patterns point to a typical coastal marine layer event, with cool, moist air dominating overnight and clearing partially during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
