Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing at lower levels. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early evening, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, which contributed to a more oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for cooler, drier air to move in. The combination of falling temperatures, rising pressure, and changing wind patterns points to a transition toward a more stable and less humid weather regime in the coming hours.
