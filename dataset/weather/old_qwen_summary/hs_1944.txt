Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting increased moisture accumulation during cooler periods. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend through the early morning, stabilizing and then gradually decreasing in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable lull around midday, and wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly and then to more easterly and southeasterly, indicating changing air mass influences. These patterns suggest a transition from a stable, dry nighttime environment to a more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity.
