Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, reaching a peak just before midnight, which may indicate the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, pointing toward a changing synoptic pattern that could bring in warmer, moister air. Taken together, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier afternoon, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms as instability builds during the day.
