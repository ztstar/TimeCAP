Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with multiple periods of near-saturation, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with brief spikes and drops, implying dynamic atmospheric changes, possibly linked to shifting weather systems or localized convection. Wind speeds increased substantially during late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with typical coastal breezes influenced by marine layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, variable pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to an active marine layer and potential for foggy or overcast conditions, especially in the coastal and low-lying areas of the city.
