Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the early morning hours, dropping sharply in the late morning and persisting at lower levels during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and the clearing of low clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage, potentially leading to changing conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong and consistent from the northwest, weakening in the late morning before increasing again in the evening, with directional shifts indicating possible changes in synoptic-scale flow. These combined trends suggest a transition from a stable, foggy coastal environment to a drier, more variable regime, with implications for visibility, comfort, and potential for developing storms.
