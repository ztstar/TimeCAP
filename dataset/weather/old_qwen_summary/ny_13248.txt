Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning hours. Humidity increased significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly, then rising again in the late afternoon, indicating moist air infiltration. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a developing frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind suggests a high likelihood of precipitation or stormy weather in the near term.
