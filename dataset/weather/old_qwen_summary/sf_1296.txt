Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, but increased notably in the late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northeast, potentially signaling a shift in wind patterns. These combined trends suggest a developing weather change, possibly leading to increased cloud cover or light precipitation in the coming hours.
