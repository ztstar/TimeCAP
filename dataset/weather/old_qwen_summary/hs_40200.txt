Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, potentially unstable one. Air pressure showed a significant rise during the midday and late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southeasterly, which may signal the approach of a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition phase in Houston’s weather, with potential for changing conditions later in the day, including possible thunderstorm development if moisture returns.
