Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from northerly to southerly and then easterly directions, implying changing air masses and potential for developing weather fronts. The overall pattern reflects a transition from a damp, cool overnight period to a drier, warmer day, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge that may bring stable and improving conditions.
