Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City followed a clear diurnal pattern, with a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual rise during the afternoon and evening. Humidity increased steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before modestly declining, indicating a buildup of moisture during cooler periods. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then experienced a significant spike midday, followed by a sustained drop, signaling a shift in atmospheric conditions possibly associated with a passing weather system. Wind speeds remained low until late afternoon, when they intensified, coinciding with a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. These trends collectively suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
