Temperatures declined steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early hours, reaching a low before rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend followed by moistening, possibly due to changing air masses. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front and the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a pronounced shift in wind direction indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of these factors suggests a transition from cold, dry conditions to a warmer, more stable environment, likely leading to clearer skies and improved weather conditions in the coming hours.
