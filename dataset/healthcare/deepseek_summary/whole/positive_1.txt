Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both Influenza A and B subtypes demonstrating sharp increases in positivity rates. The ratio of positive specimens has nearly doubled, reflecting a significant surge in circulation, particularly in the last 10 weeks, indicating the onset of a robust seasonal peak. Influenza A has consistently driven the increase in overall positivity, with its proportion of positive cases rising more sharply than Influenza B, suggesting a dominant role in the current outbreak. The recent doubling of positivity rates compared to earlier weeks raises concerns about potential strain on healthcare systems and the need for enhanced public health preparedness. These trends underscore the urgency for targeted surveillance, increased vaccination uptake, and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of the ongoing influenza wave.
