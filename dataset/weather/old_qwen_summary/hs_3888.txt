Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and into the evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase overnight, peaking during the early morning before plummeting during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure fluctuated throughout the period, with a notable rise in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind patterns were generally light and variable during the night, with a shift toward more consistent easterly and southeasterly flows in the late afternoon, possibly linked to a regional circulation change. These combined trends suggest the end of a period of moisture accumulation and the onset of drier, more stable conditions, which could suppress thunderstorm development in the near term.
