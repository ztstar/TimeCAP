Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual increase during the afternoon, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that may be bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which may signal the arrival of a change in air mass or the onset of a developing convective system. These combined factors—rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds—suggest an environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if moisture returns or instability increases further.
