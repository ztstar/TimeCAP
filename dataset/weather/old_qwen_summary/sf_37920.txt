Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, suggesting the formation of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rebound, indicating the passage of a weather system, likely a cold front or low-pressure trough. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a brief but strong gust from the southwest, contributing to the cooling and mixing of the lower atmosphere. These conditions point to a dynamic transition period, likely bringing cooler, more humid air and potentially increasing the chance of fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
