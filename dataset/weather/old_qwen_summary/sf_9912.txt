Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a stable temperature trend with a gradual increase during the day, indicating a warming pattern as daylight progressed. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the late evening before showing a slight decline, suggesting the presence of moist air masses. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speed remained nearly constant throughout the day, with winds consistently blowing from a northwest direction, consistent with typical coastal patterns influenced by the marine layer. Together, these indicators point to a stable yet evolving atmosphere, with increasing humidity and dropping pressure hinting at possible fog or light precipitation later in the day.
