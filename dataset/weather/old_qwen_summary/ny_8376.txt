Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before sharply declining, which suggests the dissipation of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure exhibited a notable low-pressure trough in the early morning hours, accompanied by sustained wind speeds and directional shifts, consistent with a passing storm system. Wind direction changed from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, reinforcing the influence of a frontal boundary moving through the region. The combination of these factors points to a recent weather disturbance that has cleared, leaving behind cooler, drier, and more stable conditions as the city transitions into a period of improving weather.
