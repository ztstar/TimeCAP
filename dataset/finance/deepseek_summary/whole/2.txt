Over the past 20 market days, equities across major global indices exhibited a generally bullish trend, with sustained upward momentum in the S&P 500 and robust gains in the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, signaling improving risk appetite. Despite a notable spike in volatility mid-period, the VIX displayed a clear downward trajectory toward the end, indicating decreasing fear and increasing market confidence. Commodity prices, particularly crude oil and gold, demonstrated strong upward momentum, reflecting growing inflationary concerns and demand optimism, with gold showing a marked breakout in the final stretch. Currency movements revealed a broad weakening of the U.S. dollar, as EUR/USD and USD/JPY both trended lower, while USD/CNY continued its gradual depreciation, suggesting potential shifts in global trade dynamics and monetary policy expectations. The confluence of rising equities, falling volatility, and strengthening commodities points to a risk-on environment, though the recent surge in oil and gold may warrant monitoring for potential overheating or inflationary pressures.
