Over the past 24 hours, a steady decrease in temperature was observed, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front and the onset of milder conditions. Humidity levels began high and declined sharply during the afternoon, correlating with the warming air and suggesting clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the northwest, likely due to the pressure gradient associated with the high-pressure buildup. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and persistent wind suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition to clearer, drier skies in the coming hours.
