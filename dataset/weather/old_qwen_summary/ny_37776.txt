Temperature has steadily declined over the past 24 hours, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to an approaching cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with multiple spikes suggesting periodic air mass changes, including a notable increase associated with a drop in temperature. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing slightly, which is indicative of a developing low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, consistent with the passage of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the onset of cooler, potentially stormy conditions, with increased risk of precipitation and gusty winds in the immediate forecast.
