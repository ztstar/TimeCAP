Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture accumulation, which likely contributed to the formation of low clouds and reduced visibility. A significant rise in air pressure occurred in the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, signaling a change in air mass and possible frontal passage. The combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and stronger northerly winds suggests the onset of a drier, cooler air mass, which may lead to improved conditions but also a risk of sudden temperature drops overnight.
