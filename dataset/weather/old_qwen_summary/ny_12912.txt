Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend followed by early warming. Humidity increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to stable atmospheric conditions and reduced mixing. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, then plateaued before a slight decline, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry weather. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in air mass flow that may precede a transition in weather patterns. The combination of declining temperatures, rising humidity, and stable pressure suggests the potential for fog or low clouds in the early morning, while the shift in wind direction may hint at an approaching change in weather conditions later in the day.
