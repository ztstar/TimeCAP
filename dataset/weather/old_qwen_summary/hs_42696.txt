Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly, indicating a shift in moisture dynamics. A pronounced increase in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, potentially signaling the approach of a new air mass. These changes collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a more dynamic and warming day, with possible implications for afternoon convective activity.
