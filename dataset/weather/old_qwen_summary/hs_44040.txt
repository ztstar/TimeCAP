Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels showed a pronounced decrease during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of drying air masses or increased mixing, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions despite rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward midday, reflecting the presence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed convective activity and contributed to clear skies. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from easterly to northerly and back, revealing a complex circulation pattern possibly tied to local terrain and synoptic influences. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving conditions for outdoor activities, though the potential for isolated afternoon thunderstorms remains if moisture advection increases later.
