Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Air pressure exhibited a significant spike in the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions and clearing skies. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and westerly directions in the evening to more easterly and southeasterly flow by midday, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined indicators point to a transition period, with the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day, though residual moisture may support isolated afternoon showers.
