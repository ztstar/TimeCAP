Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating a moist air mass that likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may signal changing circulation patterns influenced by coastal dynamics. These factors together point to a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment toward a drier, more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
