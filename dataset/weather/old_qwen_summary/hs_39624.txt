Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend during the early morning hours, followed by a stabilization and slight increase in temperature during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking during the night before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible passing frontal system or convective activity. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a notable rise in the midday hours, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with variable directions suggesting shifting airflow patterns, potentially associated with a developing boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions becoming less humid and more stable, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms but maintaining a moderate to warm feel during the day.
