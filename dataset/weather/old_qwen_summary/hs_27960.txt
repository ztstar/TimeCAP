Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, suggesting increased moisture availability during cooler periods, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, with sharp increases during mid-morning and late night, potentially signaling the passage of weather systems or frontal boundaries. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger gusts from the south-southwest, which could enhance mixing and reduce localized stagnation. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south in the late evening suggests a change in air mass, possibly bringing in warmer, moister air and setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day.
