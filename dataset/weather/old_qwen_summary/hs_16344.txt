Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the possible influence of a weak high-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from northeasterly to more southerly and easterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These conditions together suggest a transition toward a more humid and stable atmosphere, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
