Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling phase likely tied to nocturnal radiative loss. Humidity levels surged to saturation in the pre-dawn and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which later declined sharply, coinciding with increasing temperatures and wind activity. A notable decrease in atmospheric pressure occurred in the mid-morning, followed by a steady rise, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly, indicating a change in air mass and possible storm development. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather transition, with potential for afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and instability persist.
