Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels spiked dramatically in the early hours, remaining elevated through the night before dropping significantly in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from a saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest to west sectors, consistent with a developing frontal passage or outflow from a passing storm system. These combined trends point to a recent cold front passage, followed by clearing skies and improving conditions, likely leading to a cooler, drier, and more stable atmosphere in the coming hours.
