Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining, suggesting possible nocturnal condensation followed by drying air masses. Air pressure showed a general upward trend through the day, with a brief drop in the late evening, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system or a localized atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to northeast, indicating a change in the prevailing flow that could signal a front approaching or a developing sea breeze. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight environment to a drier, warming day, with conditions conducive to clear skies and potential for early afternoon convective development as temperatures rise.
