Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the midday, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more variable air masses. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around midday, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns showed a shift from predominantly easterly and northerly flows to more southerly and westerly directions, potentially enhancing onshore flow and contributing to coastal fog development. These combined dynamics point to an active and evolving weather pattern, likely influencing visibility, temperature stability, and the potential for fog or light precipitation in the region.
