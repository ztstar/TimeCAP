Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or drizzle. A notable drop in air pressure in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise, points to the passage of a weather front—likely a low-pressure system that has since passed, bringing unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night, particularly from the southwest, which contributed to the mixing of air and the spread of moisture. The consistent wind direction from the southwest in the latter half of the period suggests a shift toward more stable, high-pressure influence, leading to improving conditions and clearer skies by late evening.
