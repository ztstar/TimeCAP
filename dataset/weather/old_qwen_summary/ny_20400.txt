Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, then steadily declined as temperatures rose, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a significant decrease during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the cooler and more humid conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest, possibly signaling the approach of a weather front. Combined with a shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest, these changes suggest the potential for unsettled weather, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
