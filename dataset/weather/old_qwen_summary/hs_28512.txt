Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels began high and consistently high overnight, dropping sharply during the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more unstable condition. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, with a brief low point before recovering, signaling the passage of a weakening low-pressure system that may have contributed to the changing conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more consistent southerly to westerly flow, which likely facilitated the transport of warmer, drier air into the region. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight state to a warmer, drier, and slightly unstable afternoon, potentially increasing the risk for isolated afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
