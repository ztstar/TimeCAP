Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a daytime drying trend. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the midday hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon, which may indicate the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the south-southeast during the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the development of localized convection. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from stable, humid overnight conditions to drier, warmer daytime weather, with potential for isolated thunderstorms if moisture and lift continue to increase later in the day.
