Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a possible front passage or nocturnal cooling event. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining through the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then dropped in the late afternoon, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or low-pressure development. Wind speeds were light and variable overnight, increasing steadily through the afternoon with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east-southeast, consistent with a developing circulation or frontal influence. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather shift, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
