Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the overnight hours, indicating significant moisture accumulation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a gradual rise through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-morning and then dropping slightly, suggesting a transition in atmospheric stability. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly light and variable in the early hours to more consistent and southerly flow during the day, supporting the influx of warm, moist air. These conditions collectively point toward a high likelihood of increased cloud cover and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, especially as daytime heating intensifies.
