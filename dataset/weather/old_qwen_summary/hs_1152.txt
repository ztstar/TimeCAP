Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the day, indicating the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by daytime drying. Air pressure showed a slight decline during the night and early morning, with a brief drop coinciding with increased humidity, possibly signaling the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a boundary. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially drawing in moist air from the Gulf. Overall, conditions suggest a transition from stable, humid overnight air to drier, warmer daytime air, with the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day due to the combination of warming and moisture.
