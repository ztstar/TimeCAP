Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were high in the early hours, dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the late evening, indicating a shift in air mass and potential fog dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained gusts and variable directional shifts, particularly from the south and west, hinting at a developing coastal breeze pattern. These conditions collectively point to a transition from cool, moist conditions to a drier, windier, and slightly warmer environment, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal coastal climate.
