Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests conditions conducive to fog formation, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring extended overcast conditions or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable lull in the middle of the night, but increased slightly in the afternoon as wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly, possibly signaling a change in airflow dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the local weather, with lingering fog and cooler temperatures likely persisting into the next day, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas.
