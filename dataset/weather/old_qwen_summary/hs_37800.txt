Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to nocturnal condensation or a nearby moist air mass. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system followed by a strengthening high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from a consistent southerly to southeasterly direction, which may have contributed to the influx of warm, moist air. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and strengthening winds points to the potential for developing thunderstorms in the coming hours, especially if instability continues to build.
