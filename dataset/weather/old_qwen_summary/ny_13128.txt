Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a stable high-pressure system. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to a damp and muggy feel, though it decreased slightly during the afternoon. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and midday, culminating in a notable spike in the final hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, especially between midnight and early morning, with calm conditions and variable wind directions, implying weak synoptic forcing. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late evening may signal the approach of a change in air mass, potentially heralding a shift in conditions in the coming hours.
