Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature fluctuation. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air, likely from a nocturnal dew point rise. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a gradual increase, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system or a developing atmospheric instability. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with a sudden increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the high moisture content and wind shear, which could lead to localized heavy rainfall and gusty conditions later in the day.
