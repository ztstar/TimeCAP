Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing heat buildup. Humidity remained consistently high during early and late hours, suggesting saturated air conditions, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and increased discomfort. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend toward the end of the period, hinting at possible approaching weather changes or a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition period, possibly preceding a shift in weather such as thunderstorm development or a front passing through the region.
