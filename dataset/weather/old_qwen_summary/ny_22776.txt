Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation and possible condensation, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, reaching a peak before gradually declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low and consistent through the night, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly during the morning, potentially indicating a change in airflow due to the high-pressure influence. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and light winds suggests a high likelihood of lingering fog or low visibility during the early hours, with improving conditions as the day progresses.
