Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure showed a notable dip in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a transient weather system, possibly associated with marine layer dynamics. Wind speeds were initially strong and consistent, shifting to lighter and more variable patterns overnight, with wind direction transitioning from westerly to southerly and later to more variable and easterly components, indicating changing airflow patterns aloft. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal marine influence, with a deepening marine layer overnight followed by a gradual clearing and warming trend as the day progresses.
