Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply, peaking at saturation, which significantly increased the likelihood of fog formation and reduced visibility, especially during the early morning. Air pressure steadily decreased, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring prolonged overcast conditions and potential precipitation. Wind speeds gradually intensified throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward stronger southerly and westerly winds that could enhance coastal moisture advection. The combination of near-saturation humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a high probability of persistent fog and possibly light drizzle, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
