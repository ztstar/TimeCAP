Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated through mid-morning, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist air mass. Air pressure remained relatively constant throughout the night and early morning, then increased slightly during the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions and variable wind directions, but strengthened significantly in the afternoon, suggesting increasing atmospheric instability. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, stronger southerly and easterly winds, and a slight pressure rise points to the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
