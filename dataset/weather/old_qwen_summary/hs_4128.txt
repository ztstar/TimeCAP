Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects afternoon heating and increasing solar exposure. Humidity levels remained high during early morning and overnight hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a more saturated air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery, which may signal the influence of a developing low-pressure system or shifting frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with sustained southerly to southeasterly flow, consistent with warm air advection and potential for unstable air masses. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and persistent wind patterns suggests conditions favorable for the development of convective activity later in the day.
