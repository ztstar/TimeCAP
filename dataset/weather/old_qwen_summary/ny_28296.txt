Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime recovery. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, suggesting a period of moisture saturation likely linked to condensation or fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, with a brief increase in the early morning and late evening, while wind direction displayed frequent shifts, particularly in the pre-dawn and late-night hours, indicating changing air mass influences. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a moist, stable night into a gradually warming and drier day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
