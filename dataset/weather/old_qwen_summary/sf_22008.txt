Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before slightly rebounding in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, suggesting an approaching weather system, which may bring additional precipitation or changing conditions. Wind speeds increased during the evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly and then westerly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow likely tied to the frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition period, potentially leading to overcast skies and a higher chance of drizzle or light rain in the near term.
