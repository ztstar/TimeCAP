Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, with temperatures dropping through the night and rising again in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or mist, reducing visibility and creating a muggy feel. Air pressure showed a complex pattern, with a sustained high-pressure build-up overnight, followed by brief fluctuations, suggesting a dynamic atmospheric adjustment likely linked to shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, remaining near calm conditions, but increased in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
