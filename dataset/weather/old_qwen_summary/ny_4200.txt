Temperature showed a steady decline throughout the 24-hour period, indicating a persistent cold trend, likely driven by a sustained influx of Arctic air. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours but sharply increased in the late night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air, possibly from a passing frontal system. Air pressure steadily dropped, reaching a minimum around mid-morning before beginning a slight recovery, a classic sign of an approaching low-pressure system associated with stormy conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast to northeast sectors, indicating strong dynamic forcing and potential for gusty conditions. Combined, these trends point to an active weather system bringing colder temperatures, rising humidity, and increasing wind, likely resulting in overcast skies and possible precipitation in the near term.
