Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight increase in the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were strongest during the overnight hours, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow that helped maintain cool, moist conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the morning hours and the subsequent drop in wind speed may signal the weakening of a coastal onshore flow, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
