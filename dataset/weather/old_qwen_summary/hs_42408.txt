Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to nighttime radiative cooling and possibly a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling the approach and presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, with gusts reaching strong levels, likely driven by a developing thermal gradient and frontal influence. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly patterns may indicate the passage of a cold front, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions, including the possibility of thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift remain.
