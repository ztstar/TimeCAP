Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, indicating a strong cooling trend, likely due to an approaching cold front. Humidity levels began high and steadily declined, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting a drying air mass moving in. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking in the last several hours, which is a strong indicator of improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds showed variability, with a notable increase during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northwesterly, consistent with changing storm dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from muggy, unstable conditions to cooler, drier, and more stable weather, likely resulting in clear skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
