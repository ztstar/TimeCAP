Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the period, suggesting a stable atmospheric regime with no strong weather systems passing through. Wind speeds were consistently low and unvarying, while wind direction shifted gradually from the west-southwest to the south-southeast, hinting at subtle changes in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer event, with coastal fog and cool, damp air dominating the overnight and early morning periods, which is common in San Francisco during the summer months.
