Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained high overall, with notable fluctuations that suggest intermittent air mass changes, possibly linked to localized convection or shifting wind patterns. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased instability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts observed, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and southeasterly directions, which is typical of warm, moist inflow. These combined factors suggest a growing potential for thunderstorm development, particularly during the night and early morning hours, due to amplified instability and moisture convergence.
