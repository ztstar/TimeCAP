Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity remained relatively high during the early hours, gradually decreasing through the day, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift toward more northerly and westerly wind directions in the late night and early morning, consistent with a high-pressure buildup. The combination of dropping temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing pressure indicates a drying and stabilizing atmosphere, likely leading to clear skies and comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
