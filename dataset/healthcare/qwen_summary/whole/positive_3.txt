Influenza activity has shown a sustained and steep upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with both Influenza A and B positivity rates rising sharply in recent weeks. The overall positivity ratio has more than doubled, indicating widespread circulation and increasing community transmission. Influenza A has consistently been the dominant strain, contributing the majority of positive cases, although Influenza B has shown a marked increase in recent weeks, suggesting co-circulation at elevated levels. The rate of increase in positive specimens now exceeds the rate of specimen testing, signaling that the virus is spreading more rapidly than testing capacity can keep pace with. These trends point to a significant and growing influenza burden, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the urgency for public health interventions.
