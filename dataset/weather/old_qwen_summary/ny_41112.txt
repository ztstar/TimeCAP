Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from damp to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase during the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system.
