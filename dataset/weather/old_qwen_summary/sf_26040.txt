Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a sharp rise during the night, peaking near dawn, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, reaching a peak just before sunrise, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds intensified during the mid-to-late afternoon, particularly in the evening hours, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest, potentially facilitating the inland movement of marine air. The shift in wind direction from coastal to more southerly and westerly patterns suggests the influence of a local sea breeze or synoptic-scale flow, which may have played a role in moderating temperatures and dispersing fog.
