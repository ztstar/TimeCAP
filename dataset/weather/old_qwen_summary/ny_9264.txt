A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the arrival of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before rising slightly in the late morning, reflecting the influence of the approaching system. Humidity levels peaked during the same period, suggesting saturated air and the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained moderately consistent, but a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast coincided with the pressure drop, signaling a change in air mass. These combined indicators point to an active weather front moving through the region, increasing the likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
