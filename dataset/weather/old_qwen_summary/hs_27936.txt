Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation in multiple periods, particularly during the night and early morning, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. A significant drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger winds from the southeast to south-southeast, indicating potential storm development or frontal activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind speeds suggests a heightened likelihood of scattered thunderstorms, especially during the evening hours.
