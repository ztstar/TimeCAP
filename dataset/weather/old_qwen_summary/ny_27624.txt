Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual回暖 in the morning hours, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions and increased precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely associated with the intensification of the low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest and then to the west suggests a change in airflow consistent with a developing storm system affecting the region.
