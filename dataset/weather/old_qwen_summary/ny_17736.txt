Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn and remaining high through mid-morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a slight decrease overnight, followed by a modest recovery, suggesting the influence of a passing weather front. Wind patterns shifted from moderate westerly and southerly flows to stronger easterly and northeasterly gusts in the late afternoon, particularly from the northeast, which may signal the arrival of a more dynamic weather pattern. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind speeds points to a potential for precipitation or stormy conditions later in the day.
