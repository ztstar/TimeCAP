Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity remained low during the early hours, spiked significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, and then dropped again, suggesting a possible transition in air mass or localized moisture influx. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and later toward the southwest, hinting at changing circulation patterns. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting winds suggests a transition toward more stable and potentially warmer conditions in the coming hours.
