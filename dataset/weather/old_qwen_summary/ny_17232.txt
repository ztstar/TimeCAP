Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the night, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply decreasing in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the evening, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system and potential for unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These combined trends point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with the possibility of precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
