Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature increase during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the onset of a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with multiple periods of saturation followed by sharp declines, indicating alternating episodes of moisture influx and dry air advection, possibly linked to shifting wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined in the final hours, signaling a potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light during the early morning but increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with a changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined trends suggest a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with a heightened risk of thunderstorms as the system consolidates.
