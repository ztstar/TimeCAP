Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, reaching saturation and remaining near maximum, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature suppression. A notable increase in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions, though the persistence of fog may delay full clearing. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then to the west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal patterns influenced by the marine layer. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and moderate winds points to a persistent marine influence, likely maintaining cool, foggy conditions through the night and into the early part of the next day.
