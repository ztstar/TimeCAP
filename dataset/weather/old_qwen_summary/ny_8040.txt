Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred midday, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Temperature trends show a steady decline during the early hours, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of warm air advection after the system passed. Humidity levels remained persistently high in the morning, dropping sharply during the afternoon before rebounding, which aligns with the arrival and departure of precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly, signaling a change in air mass. These indicators collectively suggest a dynamic weather pattern involving a passing storm system, with potential for lingering damp conditions and variable winds in the immediate aftermath.
