Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist, stable nighttime condition to a drier, more unstable daytime atmosphere. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the night, stabilizing around mid-morning before slowly decreasing, suggesting a weakening high-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted significantly, starting from a northwesterly flow at night, transitioning to southerly and easterly directions by midday, which likely facilitated the influx of warmer, moister air. These combined trends point to a developing diurnal cycle typical of late spring or early summer in Houston, with potential for afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and instability continue to increase.
