Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal phase into a gradually heating daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during those hours. A prolonged decline in air pressure, particularly through the mid-to-late night, points to an approaching low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts increasing from moderate to strong, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—indicate a high likelihood of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term across New York City.
