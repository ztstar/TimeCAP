Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before steadily decreasing during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist maritime air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend, with a steady increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and eventually toward the southeast, hinting at changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a coastal fog event that dissipated during the day, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimates, and suggest improving conditions with clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
