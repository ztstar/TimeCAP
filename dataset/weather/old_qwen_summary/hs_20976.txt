Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing during the night and early morning before stabilizing. Relative humidity remained near saturation levels throughout, indicating a persistent moist air mass that increases the likelihood of fog or drizzle, especially during the cooler hours. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate and relatively constant, with wind direction shifting subtly from northeasterly to more easterly, indicating a stable flow aligned with the developing high. Combined, these patterns suggest a transitioning weather regime marked by increasing stability and reduced convective potential, reducing the threat of thunderstorms but maintaining a damp, cool feel during early morning hours.
