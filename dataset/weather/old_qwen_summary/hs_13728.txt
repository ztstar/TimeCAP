Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, consistent with the influence of a developing weather front. These combined trends suggest the potential for thunderstorms or showers later in the day, particularly if moisture continues to accumulate.
