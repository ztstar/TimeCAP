Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with values consistently at or near 100% during the early morning hours, indicating strong moisture presence and potential for fog formation. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before rising slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a cooling trend associated with marine influence. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and into the early afternoon, followed by a slight decline, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of changing weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift toward more westerly and northwesterly directions in the evening, consistent with typical coastal flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and stable pressure trends points to persistent fog and overcast conditions, likely affecting visibility and creating a cool, damp atmosphere across the city.
