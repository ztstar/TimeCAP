Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation and remaining at maximum levels, indicating a high probability of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent, gradual increase, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal throughout, with wind direction shifting from southwest to more southerly and then turning slightly westward, consistent with a coastal influence and possible onshore flow. These patterns collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather scenario: cool, foggy mornings transitioning into clearer, mild afternoons, driven by marine layer dynamics and stable atmospheric conditions.
