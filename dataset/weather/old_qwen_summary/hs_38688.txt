Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained low during the early and mid-night hours, indicating dry conditions, but sharply increased in the late morning, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the evening, peaking in the early morning, which typically signals improving weather and clearer skies. Wind speeds showed moderate variability, with gusts increasing during the overnight and early morning periods, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly, consistent with an approaching frontal influence. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and changing wind patterns indicates the potential for developing clouds and possible afternoon showers later today.
