Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to fog formation, consistent with the city’s microclimate. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early hours was followed by a return to higher pressure, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought in moist, maritime air and influenced wind patterns. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a shift in direction from westerly to southerly and easterly, indicating changing synoptic influences, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or frontal passage. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and variable winds suggests a high likelihood of fog and overcast conditions in the morning, with clearing skies and milder temperatures expected later in the day.
