Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the sun intensified. Air pressure consistently decreased throughout the day, signaling a possible approaching weather system or low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and declined through the night, with a shift in wind direction from west to south and then to the northeast, potentially indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition period likely associated with the arrival of a maritime air mass, which may bring overcast conditions and a higher chance of fog or drizzle later in the day.
