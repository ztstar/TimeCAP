Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. A pronounced increase in humidity, reaching saturation levels during the early hours, suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure rose sharply during the early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions and reduced wind speeds. Winds intensified in the late morning and afternoon, particularly from the west and northwest, aligning with typical maritime influences and possibly bringing in cooler marine air. The combination of rising pressure, persistent humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
