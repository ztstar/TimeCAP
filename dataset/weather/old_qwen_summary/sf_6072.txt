Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low stratus clouds, common in the region during transitional periods. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a recovery, potentially signaling the passage of a weak weather front or shifting pressure systems near the coast. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief period of stronger winds in the early morning and late afternoon, and directional shifts indicating changing airflow patterns from offshore to onshore influences. These conditions collectively point to a coastal microclimate influenced by marine layer development, with potential for foggy mornings and clearing skies later in the day.
