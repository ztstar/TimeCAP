Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point just before dawn, which may indicate the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more variable and westerly directions, with a notable increase in speed in the late evening, potentially signaling changing synoptic conditions. These combined factors suggest the approach of a weather front, possibly bringing unsettled conditions, including the potential for showers or thunderstorms, later in the day.
