Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, beginning high and dropping sharply in the early hours before rebounding in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a marine layer dissipating and then re-forming. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but dropped significantly in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought cloud cover and cooler conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. These conditions point to a dynamic coastal weather system, likely involving fog and variable winds, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
