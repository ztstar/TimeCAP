Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of a stable, moist air mass that likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the night, reaching a low point just before dawn, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted notably around dawn, with a change in direction from southeasterly to more northerly and easterly, coinciding with the drop in temperature and humidity spike. The combination of these factors—cooling, high moisture, and shifting winds—points to a nighttime radiative cooling event potentially enhancing the risk of fog and discomfort during early morning hours, with a gradual transition toward drier and slightly warmer conditions later in the day.
