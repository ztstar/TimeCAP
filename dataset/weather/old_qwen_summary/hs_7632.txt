Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and a transition toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels began high, dropped significantly during midday, and remained low in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a drying trend likely due to a shift in air mass or subsidence. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the morning, peaking in the afternoon, which typically signals the approach of stable, high-pressure control and clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to northerly in the late evening, hinting at a change in circulation patterns that may influence storm development. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, potentially stormy environment toward drier, more stable conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
