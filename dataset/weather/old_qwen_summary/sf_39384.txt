Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels began at saturation, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which remained high through the early hours before sharply decreasing as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds showed marked variability, with strong gusts in the overnight hours followed by a shift to lighter, more variable winds later in the day, particularly after midday. The wind direction transitioned from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics consistent with coastal influence and potential onshore flow.
