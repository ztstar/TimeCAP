Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in humidity, peaking near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of condensation and potential for precipitation. Temperature fluctuations showed a cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming, suggesting the influence of cloud cover and moisture retention. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, potentially indicating a change in atmospheric flow and a possible weakening of any incoming storm systems. Collectively, these trends suggest a transition toward more stable, humid conditions with reduced wind and a lower immediate risk of severe weather, though lingering moisture could support afternoon showers.
