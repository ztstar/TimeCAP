Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced overnight drop followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily during the early morning hours, peaking in the late morning and remaining elevated into the afternoon before decreasing, suggesting a shift in moisture content in the boundary layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then began a sustained decline, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and finally to more northerly, which is consistent with frontal passage dynamics. These combined trends point to the arrival of a weather system that may bring changing conditions, including potential precipitation and cooler air in the coming hours.
