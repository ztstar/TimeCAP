Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage during the early hours. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the night, reaching their lowest point in the early morning before rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting a dry air mass had moved in and was subsequently replaced by moister air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, peaking in the mid-day hours, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system dominating the region and bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light except for a brief spike in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. The combination of falling temperatures, decreasing humidity, rising pressure, and shifting winds points to the clearing of a previous weather system and the establishment of drier, more stable conditions favorable for fair weather in the coming hours.
