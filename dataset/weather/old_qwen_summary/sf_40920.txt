Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, then dropped significantly during midday, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as daytime heating increased. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, pointing to a passing weather system that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more variable and stronger winds, likely due to a pressure gradient associated with the approaching system. The wind direction shifted from northerly and easterly to more westerly and southerly, indicating a change in airflow patterns that could signal the arrival of different air masses, potentially bringing more stable or transitional weather.
