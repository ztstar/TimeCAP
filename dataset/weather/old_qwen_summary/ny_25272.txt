Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and remained elevated throughout the night, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to overnight cooling and potential fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the middle of the night followed by a recovery and stabilization, signaling a passing frontal system that may have brought the earlier precipitation or cloud cover. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow associated with the passing system. Overall, the data points to a transition from a moist, cooler, and unstable period to a drier, more stable afternoon, with a potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
