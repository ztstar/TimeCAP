Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more convective one. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early hours but began a consistent decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, which often precedes frontal activity. These combined trends point to a transition in weather conditions that may lead to increased chances of thunderstorms later in the day.
