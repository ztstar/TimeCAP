Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal air masses. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase midday, peaking before a sharp decline in the evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or a shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and late evening, with gusts reaching higher levels, particularly from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with onshore flow and maritime influences. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the late evening suggests changing synoptic conditions, potentially setting the stage for altered weather patterns in the coming hours.
