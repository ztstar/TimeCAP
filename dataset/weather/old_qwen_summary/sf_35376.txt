Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Temperatures remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight, which contributed to a damp, foggy atmosphere, a hallmark of the city’s microclimate. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the west-southwest, consistent with onshore flow typical of coastal weather patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more dynamic weather, potentially including stronger winds and a higher chance of precipitation later in the period.
