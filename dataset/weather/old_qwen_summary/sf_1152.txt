Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as solar heating increased. Air pressure steadily rose, peaking in the late afternoon, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable and generally dry conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the midday and early evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating a transition from onshore to offshore flow, potentially enhancing coastal fog dissipation. The overall pattern reflects a typical San Francisco weather regime, with a cool, foggy morning giving way to a warmer, clearer afternoon under strengthening high pressure.
