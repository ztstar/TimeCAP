Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout, peaking in the early morning and persisting into the midday, indicating a moist air mass influence. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, culminating in a peak before a slight decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly during the afternoon, indicating changing synoptic conditions. These patterns point to a transition phase in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day.
