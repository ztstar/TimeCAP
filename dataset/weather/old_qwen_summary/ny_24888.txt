Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low around dawn before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation before sharply dropping in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a brief spike followed by a slight drop, indicating a transitioning weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly during the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the west-northwest to the southwest and then back to the west, hinting at a change in airflow. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a weather front, likely bringing cooler, drier air and potentially improving conditions in the coming hours.
