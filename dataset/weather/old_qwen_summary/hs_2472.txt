Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend during the day, particularly in the afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels reached saturation early in the period and remained high, contributing to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during the early morning and midday. Air pressure steadily declined, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, signaling a possible approaching weather system or storm development. Wind speed increased significantly in the evening, peaking during the late night hours, with consistent southerly to southeasterly winds suggesting a potential influx of moist air from the Gulf. The combination of rising temperatures, persistent high humidity, falling pressure, and strong winds points to a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity, particularly during the night and early morning hours.
