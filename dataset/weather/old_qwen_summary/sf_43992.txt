Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a notable spike during the early morning hours followed by a sharp drop, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass or a shift in local wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, culminating in a rise at the end of the period, which is indicative of a high-pressure system building in and leading to stabilizing weather conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing synoptic influences, possibly from coastal and valley breezes. Overall, the data points to a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, likely reducing the chance of fog or precipitation in the near term.
