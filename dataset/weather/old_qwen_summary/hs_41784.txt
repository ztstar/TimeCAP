Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the early morning hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. Wind speeds were modest during the night but intensified in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for the development of convective activity or a shift in precipitation risk later in the day.
