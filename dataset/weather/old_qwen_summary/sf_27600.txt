Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising during the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early hours, indicating fog formation or dense low cloud cover, which persisted through much of the night and early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought strong wind shifts and possible storm development. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night and early morning, with a marked change in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then westerly, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing overcast conditions and potential precipitation later in the day.
