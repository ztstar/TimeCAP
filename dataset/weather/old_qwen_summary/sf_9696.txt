Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds common to the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the mid-afternoon, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief increases during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly sectors, potentially indicating a change in local airflow patterns. These combined trends point to the dissipation of marine layer conditions and the emergence of clearer, drier air, consistent with the onset of a sunny and mild day.
