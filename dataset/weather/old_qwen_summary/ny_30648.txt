Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely influenced by changing air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise, which is indicative of a passing low-pressure system and potential storm development. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with frontal passage and enhanced atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more southerly sectors reflects dynamic changes in the pressure gradient, signaling ongoing weather system movement that could bring precipitation or clearing skies in the near term.
