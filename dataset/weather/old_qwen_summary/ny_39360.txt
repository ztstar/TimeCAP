Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold night followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours but surged dramatically in the early morning, suggesting the onset of fog or precipitation, which persisted through mid-morning before clearing. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend after midnight, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and later to the southwest, indicating changing airflow patterns likely associated with a passing weather front. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cold, damp, and stable night toward a clearer, slightly warmer day, with conditions conducive to improving visibility and milder temperatures later in the 24-hour period.
