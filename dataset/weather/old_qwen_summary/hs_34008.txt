Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating moist air advection. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of solar heating and potential destabilization of the lower atmosphere. A notable drop in air pressure during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, points to the approach of a weather system, possibly a front or developing storm. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing pressure, and consistent wind activity increases the likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day. These conditions collectively highlight a transition toward more unstable and potentially severe weather in the region.
