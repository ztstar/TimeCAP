Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before showing a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought in moist air and triggered the fog. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with a change in direction and an increase in speed during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition in air mass, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a period of unstable, foggy conditions with potential for localized precipitation, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
