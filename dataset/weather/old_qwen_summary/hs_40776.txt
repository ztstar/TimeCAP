Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a saturated air mass that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the day, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to more variable directions, with increased speed and a change in direction during the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a frontal boundary. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
