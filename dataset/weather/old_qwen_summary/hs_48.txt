Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, before dropping dramatically during the late afternoon as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may be bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential later in the day.
