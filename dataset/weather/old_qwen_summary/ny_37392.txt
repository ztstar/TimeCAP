Temperature declined steadily throughout the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning, peaking in the late morning and remaining high, indicating the presence of moist air masses. Air pressure initially rose, suggesting stable conditions, but then dropped significantly in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northeast, likely driven by the developing low-pressure system. These combined trends suggest a transition toward unsettled weather, with potential for rain or overcast conditions in the near term.
