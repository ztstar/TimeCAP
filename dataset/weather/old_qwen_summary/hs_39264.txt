Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of nocturnal dew formation or low-level moisture convergence, increasing the likelihood of fog or mist in the early hours. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system or a potential frontal boundary. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast, which may have contributed to enhanced moisture advection and the potential for isolated thunderstorms. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind activity points to an elevated risk of convective activity later in the evening or overnight.
