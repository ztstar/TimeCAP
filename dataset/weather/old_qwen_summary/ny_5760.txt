Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady and significant rise, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with multiple periods of saturation followed by sharp declines, suggesting intermittent precipitation or foggy conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased, particularly in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increased chances of rain and gusty winds in the near term.
