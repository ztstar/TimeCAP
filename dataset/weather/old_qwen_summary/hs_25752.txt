Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting potential for fog or mist formation. A sustained increase in air pressure during the mid-to-late morning coincided with a shift to more stable conditions, while a brief drop in pressure later in the day may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind patterns exhibited a shift from predominantly southerly and easterly flows in the early hours to more variable, sometimes stronger, winds from the northeast and southwest in the evening, possibly indicating changing frontal influences. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a more dynamic system, potentially increasing the risk of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
