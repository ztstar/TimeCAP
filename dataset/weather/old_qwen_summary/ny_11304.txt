Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that could have contributed to fog or mist formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These indicators together suggest the influence of a cold front moving through the region, potentially leading to clearer skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
