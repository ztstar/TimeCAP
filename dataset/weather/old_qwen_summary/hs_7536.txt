Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and the likelihood of fog or overcast conditions during the early hours. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, transitioning from southerly to more easterly and then to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds remained generally low except for brief spikes in the late afternoon, which may have contributed to minor air mixing and slight dispersion of moisture. Combined with rising pressure in the early morning and sustained high humidity, these conditions point to a stabilization of the atmosphere, reducing the immediate risk of thunderstorms but increasing the chance of persistent fog or low clouds in the coming hours.
