Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture, consistent with the region’s marine influence. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, with a slight drop toward the end of the period, potentially signaling the approach of changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more westerly direction, indicating possible changes in synoptic flow. These patterns collectively suggest the ongoing influence of coastal fog and a transition toward slightly more dynamic air movement, which may affect visibility and temperature stability in the coming hours.
