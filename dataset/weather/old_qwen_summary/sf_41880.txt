Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually warming through the day, indicating a persistent marine influence. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds typical of the region’s microclimate. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a rebound, likely signaling the passage of a weather front associated with changing wind patterns. Wind speeds surged dramatically during the early morning hours, shifting from strong westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, which may have contributed to the mixing of air layers and the clearing of fog. The consistent presence of high humidity and variable wind flow underscores the influence of coastal dynamics, with potential for recurrence of foggy conditions overnight.
