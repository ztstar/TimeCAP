Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure showed a slight but steady increase, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling improving atmospheric stability and potential clearing skies. Wind speeds remained generally low overnight, with a notable shift to more sustained breezes in the late afternoon and evening, possibly driven by a change in local wind patterns. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest suggests the influence of a developing onshore flow, which may bring cooler marine air and further contribute to fog formation or persistence.
