Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting frequent fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature minimums. A significant drop in air pressure during the late afternoon and evening coincided with a shift in wind patterns, including stronger and more variable winds, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to southeasterly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and possible influence from marine layer dynamics. These conditions point to a dynamic coastal atmosphere, with potential for fog dissipation in the late afternoon and increased wind activity later in the day.
