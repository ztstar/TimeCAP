Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred around dawn, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and a rise in wind speed, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system. The wind intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, shifting from a southerly to a westerly and then a northerly direction, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These conditions suggest the onset of a marine layer event, with potential for persistent fog and cool, damp conditions in the coming hours.
