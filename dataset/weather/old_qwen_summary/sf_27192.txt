Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, coinciding with a significant increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the passage of a weather front. The strongest winds, reaching near gale force, were observed in the late evening, likely driven by a developing low-pressure system, which may bring further instability. These conditions point to an active weather pattern, possibly heralding overcast skies, fog, or even light precipitation in the coming hours.
