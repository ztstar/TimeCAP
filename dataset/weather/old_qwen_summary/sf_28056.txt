Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating a possible fog formation and dissipation cycle typical of coastal conditions. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere and contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low during the night but intensified during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and eventually the northeast, indicating a change in prevailing air flow. These patterns suggest a transition from coastal marine influence to more inland air movement, which could signal a shift in weather conditions, potentially leading to drier and warmer conditions in the coming hours.
