Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining significantly during midday, suggesting the dissipation of nocturnal moisture and a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend through the early morning, reaching a peak before gradually decreasing, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for clearing skies later. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions—particularly from the southeast and later the northeast—indicating possible changes in air mass or local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic afternoon, potentially leading to improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
