Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly through the night before beginning a gradual rise in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high during the early and middle hours, indicating persistent moisture, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in the early morning. A notable increase in air pressure occurred throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that has suppressed cloud development and promoted clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and early night, coming from the northwest and southwest, before subsiding and shifting direction significantly in the early morning, suggesting a change in local wind patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, declining humidity, and a shift in wind direction from the west to the southeast points toward a transition from coastal marine influence to more inland conditions, potentially leading to a drier and warmer afternoon.
