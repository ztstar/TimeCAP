Temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a steady回暖 during the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing cold front. Humidity levels remained low in the early hours before sharply increasing during the night, peaking in the early morning, which may have contributed to fog or low visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the day, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate early in the night, decreased during the early morning, and picked up again in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from cooler, damp conditions to clearer, drier air later in the day, with favorable weather expected in the coming hours.
