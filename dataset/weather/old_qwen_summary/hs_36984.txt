Temperature showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise during midday, indicating a significant diurnal pattern likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels remained low during the night and early morning, spiking during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the influence of evaporative processes or changing air masses. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend throughout the day, culminating in a low point in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system. Wind speed increased notably in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southwesterly, consistent with the movement of a boundary or frontal feature. These combined indicators suggest the onset of a warm, humid, and potentially unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the Houston area.
