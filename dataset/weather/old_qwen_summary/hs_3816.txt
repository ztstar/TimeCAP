Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming trend in the afternoon, indicating the influence of daytime solar heating and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking above 90%, suggesting the presence of moist air, likely from a low-pressure system or nocturnal dew point rise, which increased the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding in the late afternoon, signaling the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow and potentially indicating the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined conditions suggest an active weather transition, with heightened potential for unstable air, localized precipitation, and gusty winds—key factors for assessing public safety and preparedness.
