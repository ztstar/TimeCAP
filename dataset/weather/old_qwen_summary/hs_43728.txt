Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that later dissipated. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight rise in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were low overnight, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air flow, possibly from a southerly to a more easterly or northeasterly source. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, more variable daytime regime, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential if sufficient instability develops.
