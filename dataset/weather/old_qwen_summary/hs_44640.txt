Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the overnight hours, sustaining near-100% throughout the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or heavy dew. A gradual drop in atmospheric pressure in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to westerly, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities, potentially enhancing heat dissipation and contributing to unstable air conditions. These combined factors—high moisture, weakening pressure, and variable winds—create favorable conditions for the development of thunderstorms, particularly during the late evening and overnight hours.
