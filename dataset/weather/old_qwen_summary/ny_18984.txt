Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely due to a cold air mass advancing into the region. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours before sharply increasing in the late evening, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air, possibly associated with a developing weather system. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning, followed by a sudden drop, which signals the approach of a low-pressure system bringing potentially unstable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated with higher intensities during the early morning and late night, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, consistent with changing frontal boundaries. These combined indicators point to an active weather transition, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and overcast skies in the coming hours.
