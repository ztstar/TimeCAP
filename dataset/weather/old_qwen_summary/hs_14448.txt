Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during midday, followed by a sharp drop in the early morning hours, indicating a significant diurnal swing likely driven by changing cloud cover and wind patterns. Humidity levels remained high during the initial and late phases of the period, suggesting moist air masses were present, with a marked decrease during the afternoon, possibly due to increased wind mixing and reduced near-surface moisture. Air pressure steadily declined through the afternoon and early evening, reaching a low point before recovering slightly, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speed increased significantly in the early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a strong northerly component, hinting at a frontal passage or cold air advection. These combined dynamics suggest the end of a period of unstable, humid conditions, with a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable air, potentially signaling clearing skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
