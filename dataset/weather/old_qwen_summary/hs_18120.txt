Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline in the latter half of the period, particularly during the late evening and early morning, pointing to a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow that may enhance moisture transport. These combined trends imply a rising potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially as warmth and moisture reaccumulate, highlighting the need for weather vigilance in the coming hours.
