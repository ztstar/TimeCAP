Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and early afternoon, stabilizing around midday before slightly declining, which may signal the approach of a weak low-pressure system later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly direction, with increasing gusts in the late evening, potentially signaling a frontal influence or changing atmospheric circulation. Overall, the combination of rising humidity, shifting wind directions, and pressure changes suggests a transition in weather conditions that could lead to isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
