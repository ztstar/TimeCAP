Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense morning fog and reduced visibility. A sustained period of high air pressure in the early morning hours suggests stable atmospheric conditions, but a notable drop later in the day may signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased steadily after midday, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the west to the southwest, pointing to a change in air mass flow. These combined factors suggest the arrival of a maritime influence, potentially bringing cooler, moister air and increasing the likelihood of overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term.
