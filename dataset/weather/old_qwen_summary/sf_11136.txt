Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in thermal patterns likely tied to diurnal cycles and coastal influences. Humidity levels exhibited sharp increases during nighttime and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which then cleared during the day, consistent with typical marine layer behavior. Air pressure showed moderate fluctuations, with a notable rise midday and sustained higher values in the late afternoon, hinting at the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may be stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind conditions were generally light and variable overnight, with a significant increase in speed and a shift in direction toward the south and southwest during the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the onset of onshore flow. These combined trends suggest a transitioning weather pattern, with clearing skies and improving conditions likely ahead, though residual fog and cool temperatures may persist into the early morning hours.
