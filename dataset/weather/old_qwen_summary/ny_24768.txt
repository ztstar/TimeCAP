Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the morning and midday, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, then sharply decreasing through the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as air warmed. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight rise during midday followed by a gradual drop, potentially signaling a weakening high-pressure system or approaching weather change. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift toward more westerly and southerly directions, hinting at a developing airflow pattern. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier afternoon, with increasing wind activity that may influence incoming weather systems in the coming hours.
