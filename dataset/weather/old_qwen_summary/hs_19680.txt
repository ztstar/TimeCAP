Temperature trends indicate a steady cooling overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually warming in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that may have contributed to fog or dampness. Air pressure showed a gradual increase during the night, peaking in the early morning, which typically indicates improving weather and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and relatively consistent, with a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions in the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and stable night to a warming, slightly drier day, with signs of an approaching weather shift.
