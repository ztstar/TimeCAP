Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and mid-morning periods, which suggests increased moisture availability, likely due to marine layer development. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the late evening, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with a notable lull around dawn, but increased later in the day, particularly in the afternoon, consistent with the development of onshore breezes driven by temperature gradients. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests changing airflow patterns, potentially indicating the influence of synoptic-scale systems or local topography on the city’s microclimate.
