Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained largely stable through most of the day, with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light, with a minor increase during the night and early morning, and winds predominantly from the northeast, suggesting a stable boundary layer with minimal convective activity. These conditions, combined with high humidity and a stable atmosphere, indicate limited potential for thunderstorms or significant weather changes in the near term.
