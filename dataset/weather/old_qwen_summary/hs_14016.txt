Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and late night hours, peaking significantly in the pre-dawn period, which may have contributed to foggy or damp conditions. A distinct drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a recovery and stabilization, suggesting possible passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind activity was minimal during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and southeasterly directions, potentially signaling the arrival of moist air from the Gulf. These combined factors—rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns—point to an evolving weather system that could increase the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
