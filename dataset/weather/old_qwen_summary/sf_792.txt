Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-to-late morning, then dropping sharply during the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting possible fog dissipation and reformation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase until midday, followed by a sharp decline, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with a marked calm in the early morning hours, but increased significantly during the late evening and overnight, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that point to a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone maritime environment to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime.
