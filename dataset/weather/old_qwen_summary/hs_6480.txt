Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant cooling overnight. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking in the early morning hours before gradually decreasing, suggesting increased moisture availability likely due to nocturnal condensation or a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early hours, followed by fluctuating but generally stable readings, with a sustained low in the late evening—consistent with the approach of a weak low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to more persistent southerly and easterly flows during the night, then weakened and became more variable in the morning, hinting at changing boundary layer dynamics. Together, these trends point to a transitioning weather regime, potentially increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms as daytime heating interacts with lingering moisture and atmospheric instability.
