Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to a progressively warmer day. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, remaining elevated before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that has since dissipated. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early afternoon, peaking before a sharp drop, which may signal the influence of a passing weather front or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in airflow patterns, possibly linked to the evolving pressure system. Collectively, these trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, with potential for instability and developing thunderstorms later in the day as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
