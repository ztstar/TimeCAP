Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent temperature suggests a lack of major air mass changes, indicating a persistent stable air layer, likely due to a high-pressure system maintaining control over the region. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, increasing the risk of rapid fire spread and contributing to discomfort for residents. The steady wind from the southeast has provided minimal turbulence, reinforcing the stability of the atmosphere and reducing the likelihood of precipitation. Together, these conditions suggest a prolonged period of clear, dry weather with minimal convective activity, typical of a summer high-pressure ridge over the coastal area.
