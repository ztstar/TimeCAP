Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels dropped sharply after midday, transitioning from near saturation to very dry conditions by late evening, which may increase fire risk and affect outdoor comfort. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, with a notable increase in the early morning and late night, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially signaling the approach of a high-pressure ridge that could lead to prolonged sunny and warm weather in the coming days.
