Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a strong overnight low. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a persistent fog or mist condition during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast, signaling a shift in air flow possibly associated with a change in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and changing wind patterns suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, but with potential for localized showers if moisture continues to accumulate.
