Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with a significant drop in the early hours and a subsequent rise, signaling possible passage of a low-pressure system followed by a temporary high-pressure build-up. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and east, potentially enhancing mixing and dispersing moisture. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by instability, increasing the likelihood of scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
