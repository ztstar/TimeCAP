Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night, peaking in the early hours before decreasing during the day, suggesting the influence of marine air infiltration and possible fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late evening, followed by a recovery and a slight dip later, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to unstable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and late evening, with a shift from westerly to more variable directions, consistent with a sea breeze cycle and changing pressure gradients. These patterns collectively point to a dynamic coastal weather system, likely enhancing fog and cool conditions in the morning and bringing a gradual warming trend through the afternoon.
