Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting the onset of a drying phase. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then stabilized and slightly declined in the late afternoon, reflecting a high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with strong northerly and easterly flows, which likely contributed to the cooling and increased humidity, while winds diminished in the afternoon. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly in the late afternoon hints at a change in air mass, potentially signaling the approach of a more humid and unstable airmass, which could pave the way for afternoon thunderstorms.
