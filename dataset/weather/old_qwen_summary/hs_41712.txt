Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dew and a damp, muggy feel, before gradually decreasing as temperatures climbed. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend during the day, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing steadily through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more variable and eventually northerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, with reduced potential for precipitation in the immediate future.
