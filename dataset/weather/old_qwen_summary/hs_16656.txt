Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, suggesting nocturnal moisture accumulation, and then declined through the day, which could signal clearing skies or increased air mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the late afternoon, hinting at the influence of a weak high-pressure system that may bring drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions, potentially indicating a change in circulation patterns that could support moist air advection. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a warmer, drier, and more active wind regime, which may contribute to the development of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
