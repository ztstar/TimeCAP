Temperature steadily declined throughout the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking near dawn before dropping slightly, suggesting a period of condensation or fog formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, with a sharp spike in the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a brief intensification in the early hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, consistent with a changing weather front. The combination of rising pressure, falling temperatures, and increasing humidity points to a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day, though residual moisture may lead to morning fog or drizzle.
