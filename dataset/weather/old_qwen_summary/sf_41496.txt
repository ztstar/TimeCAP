Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually rebounding in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical of the region’s coastal climate. A notable increase in wind speed occurred around midday, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, indicating a possible change in atmospheric flow. Air pressure fluctuated with a low point in the early morning, followed by a sustained rise, signaling the influence of a passing weather system. These combined factors suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone maritime air mass to a more variable and slightly drier regime, potentially leading to clearing skies in the coming hours.
