Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a mild increase in heat. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a damp and chilly feel. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, with winds turning from southerly to westerly and later to a more northerly flow, signaling a change in air mass and potential clearing conditions. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the afternoon, consistent with improving weather as a high-pressure system moved in, reducing the likelihood of precipitation. The combination of increasing temperature, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests that the city is transitioning into a clearer, more comfortable weather regime following a period of damp and cool conditions.
