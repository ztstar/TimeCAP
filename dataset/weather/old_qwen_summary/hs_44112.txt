Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly around dawn. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred, with sustained southerly and easterly winds in the early hours followed by a reversal toward the northeast and east in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but declined slightly in the late afternoon, indicating possible approaching weather systems. These combined factors—high humidity, temperature inversion, and shifting wind direction—point to a transitional weather phase, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
