Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, coinciding with the peak humidity and fog, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system or marine layer development. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, facilitating the inland movement of cool, moist marine air. By midday, wind patterns shifted and weakened slightly, accompanied by a return to lower humidity and clearer skies, signaling the dissipation of the marine layer and the onset of a more stable, sunnier afternoon.
