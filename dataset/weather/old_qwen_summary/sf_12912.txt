Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained high overnight, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the late evening, suggesting the presence and breakdown of a coastal fog layer. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, peaking in the midday hours, then a sharp drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and early evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest, contributing to the dissipation of fog and mixing of the atmospheric boundary layer. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast in the late evening hints at a changing synoptic pattern, potentially bringing more variable conditions in the coming hours.
