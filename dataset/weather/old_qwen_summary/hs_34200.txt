Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation in the early morning hours and remaining elevated through midday, suggesting a high likelihood of moisture-laden air capable of supporting thunderstorm development. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the latter half of the period, particularly during the late evening and overnight hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly and northerly, potentially indicating the onset of a changing weather regime. The combination of rising temperatures, sustained high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened risk of convective activity, particularly during the late night and early morning hours.
