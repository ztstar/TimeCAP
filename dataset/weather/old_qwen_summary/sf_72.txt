Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, a common feature in the region during transitional periods. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a rapid rebound, indicating the passage of a brief but intense weather system, possibly a cold front or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light except for brief periods of stronger gusts, with wind direction shifts suggesting changing air masses, particularly a shift from offshore to onshore flows that may have brought in moist marine air. These patterns collectively point to a dynamic coastal environment where marine influences dominate, with conditions favorable for fog and variable winds, especially during the overnight and early morning periods.
