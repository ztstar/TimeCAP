Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine fog conditions to clearer, drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, then intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, indicating a change in atmospheric flow likely tied to a coastal breeze or synoptic-scale adjustment. These patterns collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern: cool, foggy nights giving way to warmer, sunnier afternoons under a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
