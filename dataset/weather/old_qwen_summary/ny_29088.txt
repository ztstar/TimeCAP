Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a persistent cold trend, likely due to a sustained influx of cool air. Humidity levels began high and gradually decreased, suggesting a drying trend that may have followed the passage of a cold front. Air pressure showed a notable rise, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late evening and early morning hours, with stronger, more sustained winds coming from the northwest and west, consistent with a developing northerly flow. Combined, these indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a damp, cool environment to a drier, colder, and more stable atmosphere, likely leading to clear skies and chilly conditions in the immediate forecast.
