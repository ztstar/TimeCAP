Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, particularly in the early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system influencing coastal conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, shifting direction consistently from west to northwest, with a notable change toward the southeast in the late afternoon, possibly reflecting a change in synoptic flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier, and slightly warmer weather, consistent with the typical afternoon subsidence of coastal fog in San Francisco.
