Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northwesterly, reflecting changing flow patterns consistent with a developing high-pressure influence. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
