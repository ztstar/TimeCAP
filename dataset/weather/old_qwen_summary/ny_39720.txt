Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, increasing significantly in the late morning and early evening, suggesting a shift toward more moisture-laden air. Air pressure steadily increased overnight, peaking in the mid-afternoon before beginning to drop slightly, indicating a transitioning weather pattern possibly influenced by a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the evening and a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, which may signal the approach of a change in air masses. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cool, dry, stable night to a warmer, moister, and potentially more unsettled day ahead.
