Over the past 24 hours, a distinct temperature trend emerged, starting with a gradual cooling through the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more dynamic air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity, though a brief dip occurred during the overnight hours, possibly signaling a minor disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier afternoon with strengthening winds, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather system.
