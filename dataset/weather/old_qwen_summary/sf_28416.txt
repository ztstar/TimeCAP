Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning and again in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and contributed to clearing skies. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief intensifications aligned with shifts in wind direction, particularly from the west and south, which may have facilitated the movement of marine air. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy or overcast conditions in the coming hours.
