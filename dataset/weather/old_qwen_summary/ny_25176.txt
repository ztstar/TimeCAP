Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching saturation around dawn, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline during the early morning hours, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late evening, particularly from the northwest and west, suggesting the influence of a strengthening frontal boundary. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, stagnant air mass to a cooler, drier, and more dynamic atmosphere, which may bring clearer skies and a risk of gusty winds in the coming hours.
