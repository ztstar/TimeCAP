Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during the midday hours, particularly in the afternoon, indicating drier air as temperatures rose, which may have contributed to reduced fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a strong peak in the early to mid-afternoon, followed by a significant drop and fluctuation, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching high levels, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to more northerly and easterly, indicative of dynamic atmospheric changes. These patterns collectively suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially bringing cooler, windier, and more variable conditions to the region.
