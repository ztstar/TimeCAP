Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that likely formed during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies as a high-pressure system dominated the region. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, which may indicate a change in local airflow patterns. Together, these trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and humid night toward a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer morning, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
