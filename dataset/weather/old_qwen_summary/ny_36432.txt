Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then exhibited a gradual increase, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light overnight but intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, signaling possible changes in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a cool, damp, and stable night into a drier, slightly warmer, and more dynamic afternoon, with potential for clearing skies as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
