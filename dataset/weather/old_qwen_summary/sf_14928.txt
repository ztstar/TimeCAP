Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining high through the morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely from marine influence. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, persistent winds from the west-southwest, consistent with a coastal breeze or synoptic-scale wind event. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and strong winds points to a transition from foggy, damp conditions toward a drier, windier, and potentially clearer period in the coming hours.
