Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to a muggy feel and increased comfort challenges. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were low and variable overnight, but intensified in the late morning and afternoon, particularly from the northeast and east, likely due to a developing surface wind shift associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation and improved air quality as the high-pressure system consolidates.
