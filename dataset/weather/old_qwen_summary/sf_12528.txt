Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and low visibility conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but dropped significantly in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing weather. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, driven by onshore flow, then diminished to near calm conditions during the late night and early morning before picking up again in the afternoon, indicating shifting boundary layer stability. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and easterly patterns suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the arrival of a marine influence or a frontal boundary that could lead to precipitation later in the day.
