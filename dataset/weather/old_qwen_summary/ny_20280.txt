Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery later in the day, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air and potential for fog or light precipitation, which diminished slightly in the afternoon. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cold, humid, and potentially overcast period toward a drier, more stable, and moderately cooler forecast in the coming hours.
