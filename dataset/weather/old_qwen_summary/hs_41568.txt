Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining persistently high through midday before beginning a noticeable decline, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that started to dissipate. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, and maintained elevated levels with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, potentially indicating a developing onshore flow. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more active daytime regime, with the potential for clearer skies and increased wind as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
