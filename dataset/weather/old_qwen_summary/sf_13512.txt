Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels dropped significantly in the early hours, suggesting a drying effect possibly linked to offshore wind conditions, before rising again in the late morning and remaining elevated through the evening. Air pressure increased steadily through the midday and early evening, peaking in the late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and high-pressure dominance. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning hours, driven by a shift to strong westerly to southwesterly flow, likely due to pressure gradient changes, before subsiding to light conditions during the late evening and overnight. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and stable humidity suggests a transition toward calmer, more settled conditions, possibly indicating the end of a short-lived marine influence and the onset of a more stable air mass.
