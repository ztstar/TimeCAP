Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure exhibited a notable surge in the early morning, likely due to a passing weather front, followed by a sustained period of high pressure that stabilized conditions through midday. Wind speeds declined substantially in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more variable directions, hinting at weakening synoptic forcing and the influence of local topography. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to clearer, drier conditions, which may enhance daytime heating and reduce coastal fog in the coming hours.
