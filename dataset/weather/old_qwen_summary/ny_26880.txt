Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-night, followed by a sharp rise in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought precipitation earlier in the period. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly, hinting at shifting atmospheric dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transitioning weather system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible rain or storms, in the coming hours.
