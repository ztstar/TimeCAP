Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility in coastal areas. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished to near calm levels during the night and early morning, then picked up slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns. The shift in wind direction from southwest to southeast indicates a change in airflow, possibly due to the evolving pressure gradient, which may signal the approach of a new weather pattern.
