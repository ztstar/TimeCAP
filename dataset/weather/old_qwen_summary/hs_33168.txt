Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and peaked mid-morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a morning fog or low-level moisture buildup that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a gradual rise through the morning and early afternoon, peaking midday before dropping steadily into the evening, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a shift in regional airflow. Wind speeds remained low and relatively stable throughout the day, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from southeast to northeast in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a change in air mass or boundary layer dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable morning environment to a drier, warmer afternoon, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
