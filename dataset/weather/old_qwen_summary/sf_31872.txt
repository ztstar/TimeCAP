Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of marine layer formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with prevailing winds from the west to southwest, consistent with typical coastal upwelling patterns. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly sectors later in the day may indicate a change in synoptic flow, potentially leading to variable conditions in the coming hours.
