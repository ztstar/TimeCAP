Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels spiked during the overnight hours and again in the late afternoon, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely due to nocturnal condensation and afternoon convective activity. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southwest, hinting at the influence of a developing or passing frontal system. Combined with fluctuating wind directions and elevated humidity, these conditions suggest a transition period conducive to thunderstorm development, particularly in the evening hours.
