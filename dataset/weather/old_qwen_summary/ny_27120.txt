Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, with temperatures rising steadily during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward milder conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early and middle portions of the day, then declined significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with changing air masses. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased markedly in the latter half of the period, peaking in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and southwesterly, consistent with storm development. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a dynamic weather front, potentially bringing precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
