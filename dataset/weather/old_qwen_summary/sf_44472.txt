Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent maritime influence, likely driven by the prevailing coastal breeze pattern. The unchanging humidity levels indicate dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk in nearby vegetation. With steady air pressure and minimal wind variation, the region has been under a stable high-pressure system, suppressing storm development and maintaining clear skies. This prolonged stability points to a sustained period of mild, dry weather typical of San Francisco’s microclimates, with limited potential for sudden weather changes.
