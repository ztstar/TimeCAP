Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could contribute to fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through, but sustained high pressure may have contributed to the stagnant conditions overnight. Wind speeds were generally light, with the most consistent breezes occurring during the early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted notably through the night, indicating changing airflow patterns. These conditions imply a cool, damp, and calm evening and morning, with potential for low visibility and a lingering chance of light precipitation as the city transitions into the next phase of the day.
