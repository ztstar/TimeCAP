Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight, peaking in the early hours, then dropped significantly during the daytime, indicating a drying trend as the atmosphere warmed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and improving conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, with sustained stronger gusts later in the day, likely due to a developing pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition from a cold, humid overnight period to a drier, windier, and improving daytime scenario, with potential for clearer skies and a gradual stabilization of weather conditions.
