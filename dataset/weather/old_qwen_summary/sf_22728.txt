Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco exhibited a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, which may indicate the onset of a change in synoptic flow. These trends collectively suggest a transition period with possible clearing skies and increasing wind, potentially bringing more variable conditions to the region.
