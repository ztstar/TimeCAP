Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to the formation of fog or dew, particularly in low-lying areas, before declining rapidly as temperatures climbed. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, peaking midday, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weakening frontal system or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds remained low and variable throughout most of the day, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with high moisture content and fluctuating pressure potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
