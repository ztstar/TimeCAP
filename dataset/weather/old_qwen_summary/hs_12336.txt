Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly through the day, indicating the influence of daytime heating and possibly a developing high-pressure system. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting nocturnal moisture accumulation, followed by a gradual decline, which may reflect drying air as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then westerly, consistent with a change in pressure gradient and possible frontal influence. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, with increased risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
