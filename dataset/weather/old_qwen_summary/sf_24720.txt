Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature swing, with a sharp drop during the night followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, remaining high during early morning and evening hours, then plummeting during midday, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and subsequent drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout, with a sustained high-pressure regime indicating generally fair conditions, though minor fluctuations were observed during transitional periods. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with the development of onshore flow typical of coastal fog dynamics. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, combined with rising humidity and cooling temperatures, points to the likely onset of fog or low cloud cover, especially near the coast, which could affect visibility and local microclimates.
