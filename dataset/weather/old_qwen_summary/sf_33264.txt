The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has remained exceptionally stable, with no variation in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. This consistent pattern suggests a prolonged period of atmospheric equilibrium, likely under the influence of a stable high-pressure system. The steady wind from the southwest indicates a persistent flow, typical of marine layer conditions common in the region during summer months. The unchanging humidity and temperature levels point to a well-mixed, cool maritime air mass dominating the area, contributing to the characteristic fog and mild temperatures. Overall, the lack of change signals favorable, predictable conditions with minimal risk of storms or sudden weather shifts.
