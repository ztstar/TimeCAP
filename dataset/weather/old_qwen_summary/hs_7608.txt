Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a significant warming phase during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture front or convective activity. A notable pressure increase occurred in the early morning, reaching a peak just before midday, which likely signaled the passage of a high-pressure system bringing drier, more stable air. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in large-scale flow patterns. These combined indicators suggest a transition from humid, unstable conditions to a drier, more settled regime, with potential implications for afternoon thunderstorm development and overall heat stress.
