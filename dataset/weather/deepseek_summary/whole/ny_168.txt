Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity peaked during the early morning hours and then steadily decreased, suggesting the dissipation of moisture as air temperatures increased. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a sustained high-pressure system, which typically correlates with stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, tapering off significantly during the midday hours before increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northerly to southerly and then back to easterly, indicating a possible change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and diminishing winds suggests improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures in the near term.
