Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a sharp drop overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by solar heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels climbed steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then plummeted dramatically in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend possibly linked to a shift in air mass or convective activity. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp decline later in the evening, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system, potentially including a front or storm. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with a gradual shift in wind direction from near-north to east and then southeasterly, hinting at changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, with potential for instability and localized precipitation as the dry, high-pressure air mass gives way to a more humid and unstable environment.
