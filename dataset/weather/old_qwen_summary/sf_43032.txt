Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, with multiple instances of saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the early morning, stabilizing midday before a gradual decline, which may reflect the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind activity was subdued overnight, with near-zero speeds at dawn, then picked up in the afternoon, with directional shifts from northwest to more variable, including southerly and easterly components, hinting at changing airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a coastal weather regime typical of San Francisco, with marine layer influence, fog development, and wind shifts likely contributing to the region’s characteristic microclimates.
