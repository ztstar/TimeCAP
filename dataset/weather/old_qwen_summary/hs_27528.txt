Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery later in the day, indicating a nighttime cooling event possibly linked to clear skies and minimal cloud cover. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or mist, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a cool, damp feel. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, reaching a peak before declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low until late afternoon, when they intensified and shifted from northerly to southerly directions, potentially indicating the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in regional airflow. Overall, the data reflects a transition from stable, cool, and humid conditions to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime, warranting attention for possible precipitation or changing conditions in the near term.
