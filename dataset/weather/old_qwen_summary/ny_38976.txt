Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure indicates the approach of a strong low-pressure system, likely bringing stormy conditions. Temperature remained consistently low, especially during the early morning hours, reflecting a prolonged cold front that has dominated the region. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged saturation followed by brief drying phases, suggesting intermittent precipitation and possible fog formation. Wind speeds increased sharply in the late evening, peaking during the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with storm development and passage. These combined factors point to a dynamic and potentially hazardous weather pattern, including high winds and heavy precipitation, particularly in the overnight and early morning hours.
