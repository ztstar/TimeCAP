Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-saturated humidity, with levels consistently near or at 100%, indicating the presence of fog or dense moisture in the atmosphere. Temperature showed a gradual decline through the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a cooler, foggy night into a milder, more stable daytime condition. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring ongoing cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the east-southeast, which likely contributed to the mixing of marine layer air and the dissipation of fog. The combination of persistent high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds suggests the possibility of continued overcast conditions and potential for drizzle or light rain in the near term.
