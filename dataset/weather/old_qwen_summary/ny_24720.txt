Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend occurred during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift from a stable nocturnal pattern to increasing solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, potentially clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable through most of the period, with a slight drop in the late evening, hinting at possible approaching changes in weather systems. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing substantially in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and later to the southwest, indicating a change in local atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest that a frontal influence may be approaching, potentially bringing dynamic weather changes later in the day.
