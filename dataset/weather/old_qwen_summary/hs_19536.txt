Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting possible moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, indicating a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, signaling a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest the onset of a more dynamic weather regime, potentially leading to unstable conditions and a higher chance of thunderstorms later in the day.
