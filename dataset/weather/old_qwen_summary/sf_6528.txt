Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, then sharply declined in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from moist marine conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a sustained period of low pressure, suggesting the influence of a weakening weather system or low-pressure trough. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but increased in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and eventually to a more easterly quadrant, hinting at changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from marine-influenced, fog-prone weather to a drier, slightly more unstable regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies later in the day.
