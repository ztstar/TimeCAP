Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and carrying over into the midday, indicating moist air saturation. Air pressure showed a significant rise, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night and into the morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable air mass to a drier, more settled atmosphere, likely reducing the chance of precipitation and improving overall comfort in the coming hours.
