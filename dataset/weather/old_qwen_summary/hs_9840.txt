Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with nighttime temperature lows. Humidity levels were consistently high, particularly during the early morning and late night, reaching saturation multiple times, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during these periods. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light during the night but increased significantly in the final hours, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and then to a strong southerly flow, indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined conditions point to the possibility of developing thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near future, particularly as moisture-laden air continues to move into the region.
