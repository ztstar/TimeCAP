Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before rising again in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or increasing moisture content. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, which is indicative of a high-pressure system moving in and bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning, then weakened in the midday before picking up again in the evening, with wind direction shifting from west-southwest to northeast, hinting at a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a more stable, dry, and gradually warming air mass, likely leading to improving weather conditions and clearer skies in the coming hours.
