Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, which suggests the influence of a cold air mass moving into the region. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping, signaling a possible transition from a moist air mass to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend toward the end of the period, reflecting the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels and shifting direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicating changing wind patterns consistent with a cold front passage. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from mild, humid conditions to cooler, drier, and potentially gusty weather, likely resulting in improved visibility and a noticeable drop in overall comfort levels.
