Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night, indicating a strong nocturnal temperature drop likely due to clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly during the evening and overnight hours, reaching near saturation, which contributed to the formation of dense fog, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the late evening followed by a minor decline, suggesting a stationary weather pattern with no major frontal systems influencing the region. Wind speeds were moderate during the day but dropped to near-zero during the early morning hours, coinciding with the peak fog conditions and indicating weak atmospheric mixing. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly suggests a complex interaction between coastal breezes and regional pressure gradients, reinforcing the persistence of marine layer conditions.
