Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front that brought lower temperatures during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, consistent with the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and then northeast in the afternoon, signaling a change in airflow associated with the front’s passage. These conditions point to a transition from a damp, cool, and stable environment to a drier, warmer, and more stable regime, with potential for clearer skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
