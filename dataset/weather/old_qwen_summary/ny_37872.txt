Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by a modest stabilization. Humidity levels exhibited a notable increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning period, which may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with consistent easterly to southerly flow in the early hours that shifted to more variable directions later, indicating changing synoptic influences. The combination of falling temperatures, rising humidity, and increasing pressure points to a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable weather, likely resulting in improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
