Temperature showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity remained stable during the night but surged significantly in the early hours, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to cooling air near saturation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with directional shifts from west to northwest to north-northwest, hinting at a change in upper-level flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds in the late morning, and a moderate temperature rebound suggests improving weather conditions and a likely transition to fair skies in the coming hours.
