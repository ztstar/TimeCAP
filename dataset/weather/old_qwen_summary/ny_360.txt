Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend. Humidity decreased significantly overnight, stabilizing at lower levels during the day, which suggests the arrival of drier air following a period of higher moisture. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the early and late hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds exhibited notable variability, with a peak in the early afternoon followed by a sharp drop, indicating fluctuating atmospheric stability and possible localized turbulence. Wind direction remained predominantly from the west and northwest, consistent with a shift in air flow associated with the advancing high-pressure influence, likely contributing to improving weather outlook.
