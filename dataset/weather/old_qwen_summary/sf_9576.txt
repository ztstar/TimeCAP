Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds decreased substantially after midday, with near-calms observed in the late evening, likely due to reduced pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted dramatically from northerly during the night to southerly in the afternoon, reflecting a change in local circulation patterns, possibly linked to the coastal thermal regime.
