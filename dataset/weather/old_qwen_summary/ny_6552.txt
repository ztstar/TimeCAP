Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures stabilizing after an initial drop, suggesting the influence of a cooler air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with repeated spikes indicating intermittent moisture influx, likely tied to passing cloud cover or localized precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally correlates with improving and drier conditions. Wind speeds showed marked variability, with stronger gusts in the late evening and early morning hours, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing atmospheric dynamics near the surface. These combined trends point to a transition toward more stable and settled weather, with reduced precipitation risk and clearer skies likely developing in the coming hours.
