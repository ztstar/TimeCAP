Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s coastal microclimate. A sharp and sustained drop in air pressure occurred around the same time as the humidity spike, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought moist, unstable air into the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the early hours, with strong southwest to west winds shifting toward the northwest later in the day, indicating a change in atmospheric flow associated with the frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a period of inclement weather, likely including fog, light precipitation, and cooler conditions—typical of San Francisco’s transitional coastal weather patterns.
