Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the influence of nocturnal cooling and subsequent daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, indicating potential fog formation or low-level moisture accumulation. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred during the early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in weather front. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, hinting at dynamic circulation changes near the coast. These combined factors suggest a transition period with increasing instability, potentially leading to overcast conditions or light precipitation in the near term.
