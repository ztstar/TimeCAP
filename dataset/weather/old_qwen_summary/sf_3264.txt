Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual回升 in the morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining, indicating a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate overnight, with a marked reduction in wind activity during the early hours, followed by a resurgence in the late evening, particularly from the southeast and east sectors. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and easterly patterns may signal the influence of a developing coastal breeze or frontal passage, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation in the coming hours.
