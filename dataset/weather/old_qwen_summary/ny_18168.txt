Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking during the early hours, which suggests increased moisture in the atmosphere and potential for fog or mist in the morning. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night, stabilizing in the early morning before slightly rebounding, pointing to a weakening low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west-southwest, which may have contributed to the mixing of air layers and the dispersal of moisture. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors indicates changing air mass dynamics, potentially signaling the approach of a cold front or transitional weather conditions.
