Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nocturnal temperature dip likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which coincided with fog formation and reduced visibility. A marked increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest during the night suggest the arrival of a strong onshore flow, consistent with a marine layer surge. This shift was accompanied by rising air pressure, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may inhibit precipitation. Overall, the data points to a classic coastal weather pattern: cool, foggy nights followed by clearer, milder daytime conditions as the marine layer interacts with surface heating.
