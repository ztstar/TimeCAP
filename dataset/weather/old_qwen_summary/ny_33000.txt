Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the night, reaching a low around dawn before rising steadily through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, then dropped significantly during midday, suggesting a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, implying shifting wind patterns possibly associated with a developing frontal system. The change in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast and then to the east suggests the approach of a weather front, which could bring precipitation later in the day.
