Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures showing a consistent decline during the late night and early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and gradually decreasing as the day progressed, indicating a persistent moist air mass. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, suggesting the approach of a dynamic boundary or frontal system. Overall, the combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind activity points to a transition toward drier and more stable weather, though lingering moisture may still support isolated showers.
