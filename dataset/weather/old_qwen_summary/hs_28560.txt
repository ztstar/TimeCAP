Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking during the hours of lowest temperatures, indicating strong moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the cooling and increased stability. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the mid-to-late morning and persisted at moderate to strong levels through the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northeasterly to southeasterly, implying potential moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors—cooler temperatures, high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing southeasterly winds—point to a transition toward a more stable, humid, and potentially unsettled weather regime, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
