Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of nighttime condensation and possible fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night and early morning, then stabilized, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system that may have influenced moisture influx. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south-southwest, which likely contributed to the warming trend and dispersion of moisture. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly suggests a change in air mass, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air—consistent with conditions favorable for afternoon thunderstorms.
