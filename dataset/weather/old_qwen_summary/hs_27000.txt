Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night, suggesting the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, indicating saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp spike before stabilizing, which may signal the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly during the early hours, potentially marking the onset of a changing air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a more variable and potentially clearer daytime outlook, with implications for afternoon heat accumulation and storm development.
