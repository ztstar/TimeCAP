Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained low during the day but surged dramatically overnight, peaking at near saturation, suggesting the development of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night, followed by a notable drop in the early morning, indicating the passage of a weather front, likely associated with the fog formation. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the evening to stronger and more variable in the late morning and afternoon, with increasing wind speeds coinciding with the clearing of fog and a return to drier conditions. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind directions points to a coastal fog event driven by marine air advection, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
