Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the midday hours, indicating drier air likely due to offshore winds and reduced marine layer influence. A pronounced rise in air pressure occurred during the early morning, coinciding with a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions and a decrease in wind speeds. Wind patterns were predominantly from the northwest to west-southwest, consistent with a prevailing onshore flow that weakened during the day, possibly due to the development of a high-pressure ridge. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and sustained winds suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely reduction in fog and overcast skies in the coming hours.
