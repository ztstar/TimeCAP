Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early dawn, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and likely suppressed temperature increases during the day. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring more stable and drier conditions later. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, then intensified in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest and south, which could signal the onset of a change in air mass. The shift in wind direction from the southeast and east to the southwest and west, combined with rising pressure and increasing wind, indicates a transition toward a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially leading to scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
