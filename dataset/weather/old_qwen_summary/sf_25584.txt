Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal marine effects. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture in the early morning and late night, peaking during fog-prone hours, while a sharp drop occurred midday, suggesting clearing conditions. Air pressure decreased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with strong gusts observed during the night and early morning, particularly from westerly to southwesterly directions, consistent with onshore flow typical of coastal upwelling. The sudden shift in wind direction to the southeast in the late evening, combined with rising humidity and falling pressure, suggests the potential for developing fog or light drizzle, especially near the coast.
