Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from stable nighttime conditions to drier, more convective daytime air. Air pressure showed a notable drop mid-evening, reaching a minimum before rebounding later in the day, which may signal a passing weather front or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, especially from the southwest to south-southeast, accompanied by consistent wind direction changes that align with a developing circulation pattern. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds—suggest an elevated risk of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight, particularly if instability continues to build.
