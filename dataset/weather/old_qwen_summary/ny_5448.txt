Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and sustaining near 100% for a prolonged period before plummeting abruptly in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or precipitation event. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and remained elevated, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that likely brought clearing skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, but a resurgence of light to moderate winds in the late afternoon may have contributed to the drying trend observed in humidity. The shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable and then southerly sectors indicates a change in air mass, potentially bringing milder conditions and influencing the transition from damp, overcast weather to clearer skies.
