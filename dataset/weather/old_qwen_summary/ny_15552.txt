Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed, beginning in the early morning and reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began a steady decline in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a weather system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and eventually northerly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to the arrival of a frontal system, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler, more unsettled weather in the coming hours.
