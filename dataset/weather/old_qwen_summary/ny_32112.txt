Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating a high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or dew, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning but intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, suggesting a change in air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a cooler, moist, and calm nighttime period to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime pattern, consistent with the arrival of a stable high-pressure ridge over the region.
