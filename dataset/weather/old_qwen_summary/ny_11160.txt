Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly in the last 6 hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring stormy conditions. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting a warming trend, but remained below freezing for much of the period, indicating persistent cold conditions. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with sustained high values in the second half of the day, increasing the likelihood of precipitation or fog. Wind patterns revealed a shift from consistent southerly to westerly flow, with recent calm conditions followed by a resurgence of stronger winds from the southwest, potentially enhancing storm development. Combined with the pressure collapse and rising humidity, these trends suggest a high probability of snow or freezing rain in the near term.
