Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature trends showed a cooling pattern during the early morning hours followed by a gradual increase, suggesting a nocturnal temperature inversion that stabilized later in the day. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning and again in the late evening, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, increasing the potential for fog or mist formation. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly sectors, consistent with frontal passage dynamics. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, likely involving thunderstorm development or a passing front, which could lead to heavy precipitation and gusty winds in the near term.
