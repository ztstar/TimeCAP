Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to their lowest during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight period, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, stabilizing at a high level before gradually declining, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with gusts from the southwesterly to westerly quadrant, suggesting strong onshore flow typical of coastal fog events. These conditions collectively point to a classic marine layer setup, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely resulting in cool, foggy mornings and a gradual clearing as the day progressed.
