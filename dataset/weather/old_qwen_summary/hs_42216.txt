Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then steadily declined through the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to more easterly and northerly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. These conditions suggest the potential for developing instability, possibly leading to thunderstorms or showers later in the day.
