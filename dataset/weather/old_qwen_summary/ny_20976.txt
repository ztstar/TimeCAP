Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a sustained cooling trend, likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels initially remained high, then dropped significantly during the afternoon and evening, suggesting drier air has moved in behind the front. Air pressure increased consistently throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds gradually intensified, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with the passage of a cold front. These combined factors point to the recent arrival of a cold, dry air mass, likely resulting in crisp, clear weather with a noticeable drop in perceived temperature.
