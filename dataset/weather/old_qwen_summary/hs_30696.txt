Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling event. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation and potential for fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline in the early morning, reaching a minimum before rebounding, which is characteristic of a passing frontal system or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief period of calm conditions in the early hours, followed by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, consistent with a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, which likely brought cooler, moister air and may have increased the risk of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
