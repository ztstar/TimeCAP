Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a significant warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting a shift from a moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the early hours, reached a peak in the mid-morning, and then declined slightly later in the day, signaling a possible passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained low and consistent through most of the night and early morning, with a brief intensification in the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the east-northeast, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These trends collectively suggest the arrival of a cold front, with clearing skies expected and a potential for cooler, drier air later in the day.
