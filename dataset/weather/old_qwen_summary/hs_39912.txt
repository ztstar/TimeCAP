Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and suppressed temperature rise during the day. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts approaching from the west and southwest, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or a shift in airflow patterns. The shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and northerly angles may indicate changing synoptic conditions, possibly setting the stage for a transition in weather, including potential for thunderstorm development later in the day.
