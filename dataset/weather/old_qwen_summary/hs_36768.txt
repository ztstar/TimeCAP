Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a rising daytime heat profile. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could contribute to oppressive conditions and potential for thunderstorm development. Air pressure showed a generally increasing trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring more stable, drier conditions in the coming hours. Wind speeds were moderate overall, with shifts in direction indicating variable flow, including southerly and westerly components, which may have facilitated moisture transport into the region. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating wind patterns, and a rising pressure system suggests the possibility of isolated thunderstorms later in the day, especially if daytime heating intensifies.
