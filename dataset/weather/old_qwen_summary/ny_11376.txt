Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the arrival of a cold air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high until mid-morning, after which a sharp decrease suggests a shift in air mass, possibly due to drying winds. Air pressure declined notably around the same time, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels and changing direction, indicating active atmospheric instability. These combined factors suggest a developing storm system or frontal passage, likely leading to precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
