Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. A prolonged period of near-saturated humidity occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to a noticeable chill. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning, then sharply declined in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly, suggesting an inflow of warmer, moister air. These combined indicators point to a developing weather front, potentially leading to precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
