Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more unstable daytime condition. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained consistently strong, particularly during the night and early morning, with prevailing winds from the northwest and west, which likely contributed to the cooling and mixing of air masses. These combined factors suggest a dynamic atmospheric setup, increasing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms as daytime heating intensifies, especially given the low humidity and strong wind shear observed.
