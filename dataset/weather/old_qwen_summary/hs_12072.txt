Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass moving in. Air pressure showed a slight decline during the late night and early morning, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, which may indicate the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly in the early hours to more westerly and northerly directions by late evening, with a period of calm conditions midday and increased wind speeds in the late afternoon, likely associated with a changing synoptic pattern. These combined factors suggest that Houston transitioned from a moist, stable night into a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for improving conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
