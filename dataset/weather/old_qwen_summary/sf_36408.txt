Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool, stable conditions to warmer, more dynamic weather. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum before dissipating as the day progressed. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a gradual increase, hinting at the passage of a weather front that brought cooler, moister air and later stabilized conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the west and southwest, suggesting marine air intrusion typical of coastal San Francisco patterns. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and then back toward the west aligns with the influence of coastal upwelling and the development of a sea breeze, reinforcing the likelihood of continued cool, foggy mornings and warmer afternoons.
