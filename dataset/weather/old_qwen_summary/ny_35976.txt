Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a slightly milder phase. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the pre-dawn hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a damp feel. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning, culminating in a sharp rise late in the period, signals the passage of a weather front—likely a low-pressure system that has now moved out, replaced by a more stable high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted notably, with a consistent westerly flow early on giving way to more variable and weaker winds, including a brief northerly shift, which may have influenced the movement of moisture and temperature changes. These conditions point to a recent weather disturbance that has cleared, leaving behind cooler, drier air and improving conditions for the coming hours.
