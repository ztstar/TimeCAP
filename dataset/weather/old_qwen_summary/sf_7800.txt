Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which is consistent with fog formation common in the region during this season. A notable increase in air pressure occurred around midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in local wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and declining humidity in the evening suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, typical of a clearing weather pattern in the Bay Area.
