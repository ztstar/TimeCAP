Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a low point during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, remaining extremely high through the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted notably in the late morning, with winds increasing in speed and changing direction from southerly to more easterly, suggesting a transition in airflow. This combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and changing wind dynamics suggests a likely continuation of overcast or partly cloudy conditions with minimal chance of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
