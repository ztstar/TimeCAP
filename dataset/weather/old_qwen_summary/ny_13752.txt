Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating and changing air mass characteristics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining through the midday, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system approaching the region, which may signal the potential for unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from moderate northerly to easterly and then to calm conditions before returning to light westerly flows, reflecting changing frontal dynamics and possible storm development. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, with increasing instability and a likely risk of precipitation in the near term.
