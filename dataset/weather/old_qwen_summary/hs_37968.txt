Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours, suggesting the potential for fog or mist formation, which may have impacted visibility. Air pressure steadily declined during the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a developing sea breeze or frontal influence. These combined trends suggest that Houston may be entering a period of unstable weather, potentially leading to localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
