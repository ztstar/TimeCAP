Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool nocturnal phase to increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of dew formation or fog, likely contributing to a damp and oppressive feel during the early morning. A steady drop in atmospheric pressure during the late night and early morning, combined with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, points to the approach of a low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained generally light but increased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, especially from the southeast and south, which may have facilitated moisture advection and enhanced instability. These conditions collectively create an environment conducive to the development of thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if solar heating intensifies and further destabilizes the lower atmosphere.
