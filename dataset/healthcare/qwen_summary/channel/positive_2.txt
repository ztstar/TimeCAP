- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, reflecting a progressive increase in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. The growth rate intensifies significantly in the latter half of the period, with a sharp acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a potential surge in influenza activity. This pattern indicates growing community transmission and may signal an impending or ongoing seasonal influenza wave, warranting heightened surveillance and preparedness efforts.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a clear and sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in growth during the final quarter of the period, suggesting a rapidly escalating influenza A activity. The data reveals a significant deviation from earlier levels, transitioning from moderate baseline positivity to exceptionally high values, which indicates a potential surge in community transmission. This pattern strongly implies a seasonal or epidemic wave is underway, warranting heightened surveillance, resource allocation, and public health preparedness to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a consistent upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a pronounced acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapidly escalating influenza B activity. A significant deviation from earlier levels emerges in the latter half of the period, indicating a possible outbreak or surge in transmission that may strain healthcare resources. This sustained increase, particularly in the most recent weeks, underscores the need for heightened surveillance, public health preparedness, and targeted interventions to mitigate potential community spread.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final eight weeks, suggesting a rapid increase in influenza activity. The sharp rise from moderate levels to significantly elevated positivity rates indicates a possible peak in the current influenza season, consistent with epidemic thresholds. This pattern underscores the need for heightened public health surveillance, increased clinical preparedness, and targeted interventions to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked inflection point occurring around week 13, transitioning from moderate levels to rapidly increasing positivity rates. The most recent weeks show exceptionally high values, indicating a significant surge in influenza A activity that likely reflects the peak phase of the current seasonal outbreak. This sharp escalation suggests widespread circulation of the virus, potentially overwhelming healthcare systems and underscoring the urgency for enhanced surveillance, public health messaging, and preparedness for increased clinical demand.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, indicating a sharp increase in influenza B positivity. The data reveals a significant jump from moderate levels to a peak, suggesting the onset of a strong seasonal influenza B surge. This rapid rise points to heightened transmission activity and underscores the need for increased surveillance, public health preparedness, and timely implementation of preventive measures.
