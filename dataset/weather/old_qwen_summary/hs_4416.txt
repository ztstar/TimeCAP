Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a noticeable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a marked drop during the early night, followed by a recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning hours, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in air mass and possible front passage. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially heralding scattered showers or thunderstorms in the coming hours.
