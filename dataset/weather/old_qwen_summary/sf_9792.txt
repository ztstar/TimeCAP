Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during nighttime hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure declined steadily, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring further cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases and variable directions, though a recurring easterly to northerly component was observed, consistent with maritime influence. Combined, these patterns point to a damp, cool maritime climate with potential for foggy conditions and mild precipitation as the low-pressure system continues to affect the region.
