Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a warming trend after a cooler night. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining high through mid-morning before gradually declining, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a sharp increase in the early hours, followed by a stable plateau, which is often associated with the passage of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low and consistent during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime condition to a drier, more variable daytime atmosphere, likely resulting in improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation.
