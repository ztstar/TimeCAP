Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning, peaking at dawn, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation. Air pressure has shown a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds have generally been moderate, with a noticeable decrease in the early morning hours, while wind direction shifted from northerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable conditions, likely resulting in clear skies and comfortable daytime temperatures in the near term.
