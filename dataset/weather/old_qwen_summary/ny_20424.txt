Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp rise in the late night and early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, culminating in a notable spike during midday, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system moving in, likely bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively consistent throughout most of the period, with a slight reduction during the early morning and a minor increase in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted gradually from northwesterly to more westerly, aligning with the approaching high-pressure system. These combined trends point to a transition from cold, damp conditions to drier, more stable weather, likely resulting in improved visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the coming hours.
