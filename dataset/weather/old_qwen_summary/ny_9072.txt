Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, indicating stable, moist air conditions that likely contributed to foggy or overcast skies. A significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours was followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front or shift in air mass. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sharp rise in the late night and early morning, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout most of the period, except for a slight increase in the final hours, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating a shift in airflow. These combined factors suggest that the city transitioned from a cool, damp, and stable period toward a more dynamic and potentially improving weather regime.
