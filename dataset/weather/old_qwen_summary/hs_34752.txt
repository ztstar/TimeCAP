Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary, potentially linked to the increase in cloud cover and precipitation risk. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to southeasterly in the early morning, then veered to the west and north by evening, reflecting changing air mass dynamics and possible storm development. These conditions together imply a transition from stable, humid overnight air to a more dynamic, potentially storm-prone environment during the upcoming day.
