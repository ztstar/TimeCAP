Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual warming, especially during the daytime hours, suggesting increasing energy in the atmosphere. Humidity levels reached near saturation during the early morning and late evening, which correlates with the development of fog and the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northeast, consistent with storm-related wind patterns. Combined with shifting wind directions toward the north and northwest, these indicators suggest the city is experiencing the onset of a storm front, increasing the likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
