Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the midday and into the evening, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to stronger, more consistent winds from the northwest, which likely contributed to the breakdown of the marine layer and improved air circulation. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable coastal environment toward a drier, windier, and clearer afternoon and evening pattern.
