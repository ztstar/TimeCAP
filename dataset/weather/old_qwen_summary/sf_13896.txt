Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the night and early dawn, suggesting the formation of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable drop in air pressure occurred overnight, coinciding with the highest humidity and lowest wind speeds, hinting at the influence of a low-pressure system or marine layer development. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, transitioning from strong westerly to near-calm conditions, then reactivating with variable but generally southerly winds, which may signal changing synoptic conditions. These observations point to a strong marine influence, with nocturnal cooling, fog formation, and wind variability characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, potentially leading to continued overcast or foggy conditions in the near term.
