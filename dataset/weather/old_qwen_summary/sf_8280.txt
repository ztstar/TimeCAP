Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of low-level atmospheric stability, marked by consistently high humidity levels that peaked at near saturation, particularly during the early morning hours. A notable shift in air pressure occurred mid-cycle, with a sharp rise followed by a prolonged high-pressure plateau, indicating the arrival and persistence of a stable air mass. Temperature trends revealed a gradual cooling overnight, with the lowest values recorded in the early morning, followed by a slow recovery during the day, reflecting typical coastal marine influence. Wind speeds remained minimal through the night and early morning, suggesting weak synoptic forcing, but increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to localized thermal effects or changes in pressure gradients. The wind direction shifted significantly during the night, transitioning from a southwest to a more westerly and then southerly flow, which may have contributed to the influx of moist air and the development of foggy conditions in the early hours.
