Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent and gradual cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a modest warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout most of the day, peaking in the early hours and gradually declining, indicating a stable marine influence. Air pressure showed a slight drop in the latter half of the period, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. Wind speeds were uniformly low and unvarying, pointing to a period of calm atmospheric conditions with minimal turbulence. Wind direction shifted significantly from northwest to northeast and then to southeast in the morning, potentially signaling the arrival of a coastal breeze pattern typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
