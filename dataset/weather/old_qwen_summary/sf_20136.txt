Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a persistent marine layer with near-constant high humidity levels, indicating stable, moist air near the surface. Temperatures remained consistently cool throughout the period, with minimal variation, reflecting the influence of coastal fog and the moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend in the late evening, suggesting a weakening of the high-pressure system that typically dominates the region, potentially allowing for increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted significantly in the early morning hours, indicating a change in local airflow likely driven by thermal or synoptic-scale influences. These conditions point to a prolonged period of overcast, damp weather with limited wind, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the summer months.
