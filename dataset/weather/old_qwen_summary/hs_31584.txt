Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning before a gradual increase, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system approaching the region. Wind speeds were low during the overnight hours, with a shift toward more consistent easterly to southerly winds in the afternoon, which may have facilitated the movement of moist air into the area. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and changing wind patterns indicates a potential for developing afternoon thunderstorms, particularly in the late afternoon to evening hours.
