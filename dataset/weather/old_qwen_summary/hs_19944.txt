Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in atmospheric pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained consistently high, frequently near saturation, which enhances the perception of mugginess and increases the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the final hours, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, signaling a change in air mass and potential storm development. These combined conditions suggest a high probability of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, requiring heightened awareness for residents.
