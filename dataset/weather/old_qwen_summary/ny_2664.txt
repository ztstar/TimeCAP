Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels dropped sharply overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before beginning to rise again, suggesting the influence of drying air masses. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a low level before showing a slight recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably after midday, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by cooling, drying, and strengthening winds, likely associated with a cold front moving through the region, which may bring clearer skies but cooler conditions in the near term.
