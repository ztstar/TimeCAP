Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a drying trend. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, which was followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather system, possibly a front. Wind speeds decreased substantially after midnight, with calm conditions prevailing during the midday hours, though wind direction shifted dramatically, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable coastal air mass to a drier, more variable regime, potentially signaling the end of foggy conditions and the arrival of clearer skies.
