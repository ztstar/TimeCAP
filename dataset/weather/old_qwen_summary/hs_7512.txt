Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual回升 in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture availability that likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then rose notably in the mid-morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but increased significantly in the evening, accompanied by a marked shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, suggesting a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stagnant overnight period to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with potential for improving visibility and reduced cloud cover in the coming hours.
