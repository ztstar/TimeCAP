Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and beginning to recover in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation before gradually declining, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were variable, with strong gusts in the early morning followed by calm periods, especially during midday, which may have contributed to the development and persistence of fog. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly sectors hints at changing atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the onset of a coastal weather pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics.
