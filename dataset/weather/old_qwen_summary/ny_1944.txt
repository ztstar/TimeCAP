Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the early morning, indicating a transition from a cooler nighttime period to a milder daytime condition. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then dropped sharply during the late morning and early afternoon before increasing again in the evening, suggesting a possible influence from a passing weather system. Air pressure exhibited a continuous downward trend, reaching its lowest point in the early afternoon before stabilizing slightly, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the afternoon, peaking in the midday hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, consistent with the development of a frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest the city experienced the arrival of a storm system, likely bringing unsettled conditions, including precipitation, and a noticeable drop in temperature later in the day.
