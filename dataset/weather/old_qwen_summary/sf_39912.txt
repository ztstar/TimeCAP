Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually recovering in the afternoon. A sharp increase in humidity during the early morning hours coincided with a notable drop in wind speed, suggesting the presence of fog or low-lying stratus clouds, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a temporary dip during the early hours followed by a sustained rise, indicating a shift from a weak low-pressure system to more stable, high-pressure conditions. Wind patterns showed a strong westerly component in the evening and night, shifting to variable but generally light winds in the morning, with a notable surge in speed and a shift to a southerly direction in the late afternoon. These conditions point to a transition from a foggy, cool overnight period to a clearer, milder afternoon, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics and onshore breezes.
