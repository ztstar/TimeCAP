Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the day, indicating the passage of a moist air mass. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, signaling a change in air flow that may precede a change in weather patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with potential for continued fair weather in the near term.
