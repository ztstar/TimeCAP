Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels were initially high during the early morning hours, then steadily declined, indicating a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential for improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and overnight hours, particularly from the south and southeast, which may have contributed to the cooling and drying trend. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors suggests a change in air mass, possibly bringing drier and more stable air, which could lead to clearer skies and reduced fog in the coming hours.
