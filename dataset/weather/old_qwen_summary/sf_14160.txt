Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a marked diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with periods of very high moisture followed by sharp drying, suggesting the influence of both marine air intrusion and inland air mass changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with minor fluctuations that did not signal a strong weather system passage, though a brief increase in pressure coincided with the coolest temperatures. Wind speeds were generally light, with calm conditions during the early morning and a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing airflow patterns, possibly due to local topography. These combined dynamics point to a typical coastal microclimate scenario, with sea breeze effects playing a key role in shaping daily conditions.
