Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the early hours and a modest rise later in the day, indicating persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, peaking mid-morning before a sharp drop in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, signaling a change in airflow. These patterns suggest the arrival of a developing low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather, including potential precipitation, in the coming hours.
