Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, indicating possible fog formation, which was confirmed by near-zero wind speeds and stable conditions. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a brief recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought cloud cover or light precipitation. Wind patterns shifted dramatically in the late afternoon, with strong northerly winds giving way to calm conditions and then a resurgence of light, variable winds, likely due to changing pressure gradients. These conditions—combined with elevated humidity and temperature fluctuations—point to a dynamic coastal atmosphere typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, potentially influencing visibility and local air quality.
