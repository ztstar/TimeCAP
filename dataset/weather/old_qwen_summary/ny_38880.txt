Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rise, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity increased sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation levels, which suggests the likelihood of fog formation or precipitation during the early hours. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night, with a notable drop in the early morning, signaling the approach of an advancing low-pressure system. Wind speeds fluctuated, with a brief surge in the late evening and sustained moderate to strong winds from the northwest and west, consistent with a frontal passage. Combined, these indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, likely bringing overcast skies, possible drizzle or fog, and a chance of light precipitation in the coming hours.
