Temperature showed a steady increase throughout the day, indicating a warming trend that suggests the approach of a more stable air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late afternoon and evening, peaking during nighttime hours, which may contribute to fog formation or reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited a gradual rise, culminating in a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds declined sharply in the early morning, followed by a return to moderate levels in the late evening, with wind direction shifting from west-northwest to south-southeast, signaling a possible change in air flow. Overall, the data suggests a transition from cooler, drier conditions to a more humid and stable environment, potentially leading to partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
