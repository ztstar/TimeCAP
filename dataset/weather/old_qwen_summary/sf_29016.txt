Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. A notable pressure rise in the early morning hours signaled the approach of a high-pressure system, likely leading to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from strong westerly to more variable directions, with a marked decrease in speed during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a weakening of coastal influence. These changes indicate a transition from a damp, cool marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, typical of late summer conditions in the region.
