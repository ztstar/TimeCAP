Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. A consistent drop in air pressure during the late night and early morning indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, possibly signaling a shift in atmospheric dynamics. The wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly, aligning with the movement of a frontal system that may bring changing conditions later today.
