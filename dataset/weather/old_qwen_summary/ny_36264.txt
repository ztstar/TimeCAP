Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before beginning a slow recovery. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping during midday, indicating alternating air mass influences. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and late evening, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, indicating dynamic airflow patterns likely driven by pressure gradients. These combined trends point to a transition toward more settled and dry weather in New York City, with improving conditions expected in the near term.
