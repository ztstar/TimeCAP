Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a brief drop in the early hours, followed by a sustained increase, which may indicate the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the overnight and late afternoon periods, with shifts in wind direction reflecting changing air flow patterns, including a prominent shift toward southerly and easterly flows in the late afternoon. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool marine layer to a drier, warmer, and more stable air mass, consistent with the typical afternoon clearing seen in San Francisco’s microclimate.
