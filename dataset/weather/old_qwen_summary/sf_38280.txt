Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, peaking during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable pressure increase in the late afternoon indicates the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with stronger gusts observed during transitional phases, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon, possibly linked to localized sea breeze or drainage flow. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then to more variable patterns reflects dynamic atmospheric adjustments, likely associated with the interaction of marine layer processes and changing pressure gradients.
