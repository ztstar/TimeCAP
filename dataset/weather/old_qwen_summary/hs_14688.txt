Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, reaching near-saturation conditions before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture-laden air mass followed by drier air advection. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds remained low overnight, increasing in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, implying a change in air mass flow. These patterns point to the transition from a moist, unstable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
