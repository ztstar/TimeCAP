Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, indicating a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a sharp decline during the night, followed by a rapid rebound and sustained high pressure in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and late evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then toward the south-southwest, aligning with changing pressure gradients. These patterns point to a dynamic atmospheric transition, likely involving the influence of a coastal storm system that brought moisture and strong winds, followed by clearing skies and drier, more stable conditions.
