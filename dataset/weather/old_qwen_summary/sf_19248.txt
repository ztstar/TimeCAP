Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced consistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Temperature trends show a gradual decline through the night, followed by a slight recovery in the early morning, suggesting the influence of marine layer dynamics. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the approach and establishment of a stable high-pressure system, which typically brings calm and clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a strong southwest to west flow during the night transitioning to more variable and weaker winds in the morning, possibly indicating a weakening of onshore flow. These conditions point to a stabilized marine layer, with potential for fog persistence into the morning hours and a likely improvement in conditions later in the day as the pressure continues to rise.
