Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the day, indicating a transition from damp, cool conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, particularly from the northwest and south-southeast sectors, possibly due to localized coastal dynamics. The overall pattern points to a cooling nocturnal phase followed by a warming trend under a strengthening high-pressure influence, consistent with typical San Francisco maritime climate behavior.
