Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady but gradual increase, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels reached near saturation in the early morning hours and remained extremely high, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may contribute to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily declined over time, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained relatively consistent with a slight increase during the early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly, indicating a change in airflow associated with the developing system. Combined, these indicators point to the likelihood of continued overcast conditions and a potential for light precipitation as the low-pressure system moves closer to the region.
