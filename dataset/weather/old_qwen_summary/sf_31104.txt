Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, peaking before dropping significantly through the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure fluctuated with multiple sharp drops and sustained high readings, pointing to the influence of shifting weather systems, including a possible passing front. Wind patterns revealed a shift from southerly and westerly flows in the early hours to more variable and stronger easterly winds later, potentially driven by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition period marked by coastal fog dissipation, increasing sunshine, and the potential for stable conditions in the coming hours.
