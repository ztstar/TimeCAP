Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a milder afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation for extended periods, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere and increasing the likelihood of fog or light precipitation. Air pressure showed a marked rise during the evening, peaking in the late night and early morning, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system, leading to more stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early and late hours, with strong, shifting winds from the northwest and northeast, potentially contributing to turbulent conditions and localized storm development. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating wind patterns, and pressure changes implies a dynamic weather environment, with elevated potential for thunderstorms or sudden weather shifts in the near term.
