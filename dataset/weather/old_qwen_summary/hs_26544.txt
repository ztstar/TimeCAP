Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels surged overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, before sharply declining in the afternoon as the air warmed and dried. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were moderate to low during the night and early morning, but intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east, possibly signaling a shift in air mass or the influence of a developing circulation. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, more variable afternoon, with potential for increased comfort during the day but lingering risks of sudden weather changes due to shifting wind patterns.
