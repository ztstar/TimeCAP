Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible fog formation. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased through the night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, which likely contributed to the mixing of air and the dispersion of moisture. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northeasterly in the afternoon may signal the influence of a coastal breeze or a change in the synoptic pattern, potentially affecting visibility and temperature stability.
