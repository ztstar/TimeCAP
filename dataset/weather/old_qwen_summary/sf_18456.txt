Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight drop in the early hours, suggesting the influence of a weak low-pressure system or marine layer development. Wind speeds were consistently low, with near-zero gusts during the early morning, but wind direction shifted dramatically, transitioning from westerly to southerly and then to a more easterly flow, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. These conditions point to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with strong potential for fog and cool, damp conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
