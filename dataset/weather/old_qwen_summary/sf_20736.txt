Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly, indicating the presence of persistent moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend, particularly in the early morning, which may suggest the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with minor increases during the night and early morning, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the northeast to the east-southeast, hinting at changing local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition period with increasing moisture and potential for fog or overcast skies, especially during the early morning hours.
