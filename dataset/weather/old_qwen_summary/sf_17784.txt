Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a maritime air mass and possible fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase later in the day, indicating the approach or passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions around dawn, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, likely due to a developing sea breeze. Wind directions shifted dramatically from northerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics and potential impacts on coastal fog patterns and local microclimates.
