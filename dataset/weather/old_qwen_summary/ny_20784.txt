Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a distinct pattern, starting high, decreasing during the overnight period, and spiking again in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of moist air. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the latter half of the day, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the morning and remained elevated through the day, with winds shifting from the southeast to a more northerly direction, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from unstable, cool, and moist conditions to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming environment, likely leading to improving weather in the near term.
