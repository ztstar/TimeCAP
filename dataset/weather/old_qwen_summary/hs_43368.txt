Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the day, culminating in a slight peak before declining again, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system that may have brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, potentially signaling a shift in air mass or the onset of convective activity. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates a transition phase that could lead to isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
