Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early hours, suggesting moist air accumulation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation in the pre-dawn period. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a recovery and sustained higher pressure later in the day, hinting at the passage of a weather system that may have brought brief instability. Wind speeds remained low except for a notable increase in the late morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling the influence of a developing sea breeze or a changing pressure gradient. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable high pressure suggests improving conditions toward fair weather, with reduced risk of precipitation in the near term.
