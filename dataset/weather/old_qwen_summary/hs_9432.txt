Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly throughout the day, peaking near saturation, which suggests increasing moisture content in the atmosphere and a higher likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily decreased, especially in the last 12 hours, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system, which could bring stormy conditions. Winds remained moderate and consistently from the southeast to east-southeast, shifting gradually to the east-southeast and then to the southeast later in the period, consistent with a developing storm track. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and steady wind patterns—indicate a high probability of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
