Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting a clear diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly through the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, then dropped sharply in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no signs of an approaching low-pressure system or storm front. Wind speeds were low during the early morning hours, increasing steadily through the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, which may signal the influence of a developing sea breeze or local thermal circulation. These combined patterns suggest a high likelihood of afternoon thunderstorm development, particularly given the moisture buildup and rising wind speeds.
