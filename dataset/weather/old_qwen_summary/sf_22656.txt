Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning, persisting near 100% for over 10 hours, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover typical of the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the suppression of precipitation. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that gradually shifted toward the west-southwest, reinforcing the onshore breeze pattern. These conditions suggest a persistent marine layer with limited mixing, supporting cool, foggy mornings and relatively mild afternoons, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
