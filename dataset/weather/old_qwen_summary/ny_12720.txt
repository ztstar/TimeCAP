Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before stabilizing, indicating a prolonged cold trend likely driven by a persistent cold air mass. Humidity levels exhibited a moderate rise during the early hours, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a drying trend possibly linked to sinking air or a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reaching a peak in the late evening, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds showed a notable surge in the late night and early morning, with higher gusts from the northwest and north-northwest directions, likely associated with a strengthening gradient from the high-pressure system. The combination of cooling temperatures, falling humidity, rising pressure, and variable but generally strong winds points to a dry, crisp, and stable weather regime, favorable for clear skies and potentially frosty conditions during the overnight hours.
