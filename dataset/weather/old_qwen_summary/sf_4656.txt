Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, indicating the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a general upward trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts during the early morning and late afternoon, and wind directions shifted from westerly to more variable or calm, implying a weakening of coastal flow. These conditions point to a transition from a foggy, cool marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to improved visibility and warmer daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
