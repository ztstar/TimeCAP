Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold nighttime phase to a milder daytime period. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation around dawn, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clearing conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and then back to northerly, hinting at changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cold, moist, and potentially foggy night into a clearer, milder, and more stable day, favorable for outdoor activities later in the day.
