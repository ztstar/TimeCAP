Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a rebound in the afternoon, indicating changing air mass dynamics. Air pressure rose consistently throughout the period, peaking midday and remaining high, signaling the influence of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast across the day, suggesting a transition in atmospheric flow. The combination of falling temperatures, rising pressure, and shifting winds points to the passage of a cold front, likely resulting in clearer skies and cooler conditions for the remainder of the day.
