Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from damp, foggy conditions to drier air. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with a strong gust observed toward the end of the period, suggesting the influence of shifting pressure systems. Air pressure showed a brief dip in the midday hours, followed by a steady rise, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure ridge bringing clearer skies. The combination of rising winds, falling humidity, and warming temperatures suggests a transition from coastal fog and cool conditions toward more stable, sunny weather by the end of the period.
