Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling trend. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, particularly from the northeast, which may have brought drier air and potential clearing. These changes collectively point to the transition from a marine-influenced, foggy regime to a drier, potentially clearer pattern, with the possibility of improved visibility and warmer temperatures later tonight.
