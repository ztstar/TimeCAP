Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend during the night and a return to milder conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout, peaking during the overnight hours and contributing to a noticeably damp and muggy feel, which could influence comfort levels and potential for fog formation. Air pressure held relatively stable during the early to mid-period, with a slight drop in the latter half of the day, suggesting the possible approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a consistent shift toward the northwest in the afternoon and evening, which may have aided in dispersing moisture but also contributed to cooler surface conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition period with lingering dampness and cooling, possibly leading to overcast skies and a higher chance of light precipitation later in the day.
