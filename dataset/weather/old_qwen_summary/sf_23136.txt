Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the final hours, indicating a possible approaching low-pressure system that may bring further changes in weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, increasing steadily through the day, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions collectively point to a maritime influence and the potential for overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term.
