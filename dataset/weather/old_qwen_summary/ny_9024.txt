Over the past 24 hours, temperatures fluctuated significantly, with a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a possible transition in air mass. Air pressure showed a marked drop during the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which was followed by a slow recovery, implying stabilization in the weather pattern. Wind speeds increased in the early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the east-northeast to the southeast, consistent with a developing front. These combined indicators suggest a period of unstable weather, likely bringing overcast skies and potential for scattered showers or light rain in the near term.
