Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, with a brief increase in the late afternoon that may signal the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, then gradually increased through the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may indicate a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, slightly more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially leading to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
