Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the night and early morning, coinciding with a significant rise in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, suggesting the arrival of a marine influence. The air pressure steadily declined through the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increased wind and moisture. A pronounced wind burst occurred around dawn, driven by strong southwest winds, which may have facilitated coastal fog formation and enhanced mixing in the lower atmosphere. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward more unstable and potentially foggy conditions, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate.
