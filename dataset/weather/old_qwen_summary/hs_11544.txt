Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature increase during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the onset of a warming trend likely influenced by daytime solar heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained relatively high overnight and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition to drier conditions as a warm front moved through. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the unstable conditions and increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, with sustained stronger winds from a southerly to westerly direction, consistent with an approaching weather system. These combined patterns suggest a shift toward potentially unsettled weather, including the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
