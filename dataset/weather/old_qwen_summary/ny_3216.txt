Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, beginning high and dropping sharply during the afternoon, correlating with a significant decrease in cloud cover and increased solar exposure. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds intensified in the midday hours, peaking in the late afternoon before subsiding, with wind direction shifting from northeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. Collectively, these indicators suggest the city transitioned from a cool, damp, and unstable regime to a drier, more stable, and clearer environment, likely resulting in improved visibility and comfortable conditions by evening.
