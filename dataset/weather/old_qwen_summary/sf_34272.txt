Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping significantly overnight. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a sustained high before declining in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent decline, particularly in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to more southerly and westerly sectors, consistent with a strengthening onshore flow. These patterns collectively point to the arrival of a moist, maritime air mass, likely bringing overcast conditions and a heightened chance of fog or light drizzle, especially during the early morning hours.
