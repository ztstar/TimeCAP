Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation for extended periods, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, reaching its lowest point in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the midday and evening, with stronger gusts observed in the late afternoon, likely driven by the developing low-pressure system. The wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly and northerly, indicating a change in airflow that could facilitate storm development or the arrival of cooler air, increasing the likelihood of rain or thunderstorms.
