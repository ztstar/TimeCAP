Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, then declined through the day, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure remained nearly stable throughout the night and early morning, then showed a gradual decline in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southeasterly, which may indicate the onset of a change in air mass or local circulation patterns. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating wind patterns, and a weakening pressure gradient suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, particularly during the afternoon hours.
