Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating dense fog formation, which rapidly cleared as temperatures rose and wind speeds increased. A significant shift in air pressure occurred around midday, with a sharp rise followed by a drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought gusty conditions and changing wind patterns. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the midday and early evening, with strong gusts from the northwest and north, likely contributing to the dissipation of fog and dispersal of moisture. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable wind direction points to a dynamic and transitional weather period, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal microclimate and frequent fog events.
