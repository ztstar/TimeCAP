Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling front that has since begun to retreat. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early hours, then plummeted during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system, which has since stabilized, contributing to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally low during the midday and late night, but strong gusts occurred in the early morning, associated with shifting wind directions from the south and southeast. The combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and stable wind patterns points to improving weather conditions, with the potential for sunny, comfortable days ahead.
