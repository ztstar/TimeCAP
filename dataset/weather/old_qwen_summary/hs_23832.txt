Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooldown during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating the presence of moist air masses. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more easterly over the day, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These combined trends suggest an evolving atmospheric setup that could lead to unstable conditions, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
