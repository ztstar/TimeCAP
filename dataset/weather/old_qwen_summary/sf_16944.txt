Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, which significantly enhances the perception of chill and supports fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase from mid-morning onward, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were low and variable during the night, intensifying slightly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, consistent with onshore flow typical of marine layer dynamics. Collectively, these conditions point to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to fog and cool, damp conditions, especially in low-lying and coastal areas.
