Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A significant increase in wind speed occurred during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, indicating a dynamic change in air mass movement. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the influence of coastal fog dissipation and inland air advection. Air pressure showed a general rise through the night, culminating in a high-pressure buildup before a brief drop in the late afternoon, which may have contributed to the wind surge. These conditions collectively point to a coastal transition period, likely driven by marine layer dynamics, with implications for visibility, temperature stability, and wind exposure across the region.
