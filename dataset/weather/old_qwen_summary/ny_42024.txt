Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then steadily declined in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with a developing frontal boundary. These indicators collectively suggest the onset of a transition period, with potential for increasing cloud cover and a higher chance of precipitation later in the day.
