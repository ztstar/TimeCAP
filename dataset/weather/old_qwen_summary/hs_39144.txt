Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which persisted until mid-morning. Air pressure showed a slight decline through the night, followed by a modest rise in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system and a subsequent stabilization. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the south and southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could bring moisture and potential for isolated showers. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the latter part of the day signals a change in air mass, potentially introducing warmer, moister conditions that may influence overnight cloud cover and the risk of thunderstorms.
