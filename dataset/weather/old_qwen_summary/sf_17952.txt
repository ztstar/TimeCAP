Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog formation and persistent dampness, consistent with the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially before a gradual increase, indicating the potential approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies later. Wind speeds were low overnight, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then to the south-southeast, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow likely tied to a developing or shifting weather front. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to the presence of a marine layer, which may continue to influence conditions with cool, foggy mornings and limited daytime warming.
