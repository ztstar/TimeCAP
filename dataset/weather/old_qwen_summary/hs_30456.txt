Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained high in the initial phase before sharply decreasing, suggesting the arrival of drier air, possibly associated with a passing front. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, peaking in the late morning, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably late in the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in circulation patterns, potentially linked to a cold front moving through the region. These combined signals suggest a transition from warm, humid conditions to cooler, drier weather, with the potential for improved air quality and lower chances of precipitation in the near term.
