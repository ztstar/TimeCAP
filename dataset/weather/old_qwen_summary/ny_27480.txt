Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity surged to saturation levels during the early hours, likely triggering fog or mist, before decreasing significantly as the day progressed, suggesting clearing conditions. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise slightly, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with shifts in direction indicating changing wind patterns, possibly due to the influence of a weather front. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cold, damp, and windy night to a gradually warming, clearing day, with potential for improving visibility and more stable conditions later in the day.
