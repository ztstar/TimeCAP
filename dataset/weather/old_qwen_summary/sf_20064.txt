Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a persistent and stable atmospheric pressure, indicating a lack of significant weather systems passing through the region. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a slow warming during the day, suggesting a stable marine layer influence typical of the coastal climate. Humidity remained near or at saturation levels throughout much of the night and early morning, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns near the coast. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind directions points to a prolonged period of fog and overcast conditions, especially in the early morning hours.
