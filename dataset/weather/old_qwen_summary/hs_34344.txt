Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels reached saturation during the nighttime and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night with a slight rise in the mid-morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of local circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind, and warming temperatures in the late afternoon could increase the risk of thunderstorm development later in the day if sufficient instability develops.
