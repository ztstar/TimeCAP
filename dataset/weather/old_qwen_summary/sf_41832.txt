Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the late afternoon. A marked increase in humidity occurred overnight, peaking during the early hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s maritime climate. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a rapid recovery, indicating the passage of a transient weather system, possibly a low-pressure trough or front. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with a transition from consistent southwesterly flow to strong easterly and northerly winds in the late evening, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a dynamic and transitional weather period, increasing the likelihood of foggy conditions and cooler temperatures in the near term.
