Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near 100%, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, which is characteristic of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a shift from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, reflecting changing flow around the developing high-pressure ridge. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, cool night to a clearer, gradually warming day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate patterns.
