Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by daytime solar heating and sustained high pressure. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon as the air warmed and pressure stabilized, suggesting drier air masses were moving in. Air pressure gradually rose throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift toward more persistent and stronger westerly to southwesterly flow, which may have brought in drier air from inland regions. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable morning to a warmer, drier, and increasingly windy afternoon and evening, setting the stage for comfortable conditions with low chances of precipitation.
