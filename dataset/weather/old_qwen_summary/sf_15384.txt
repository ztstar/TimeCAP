Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. A sharp increase in humidity, peaking near saturation, coincided with the coldest part of the night, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, typical of the region’s marine influence. Air pressure surged dramatically during the early morning, suggesting the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the night, but a sudden intensification in the late afternoon and evening—particularly from a northerly direction—may have contributed to mixing and clearing of the fog. The shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then to a more easterly component suggests a change in large-scale flow, potentially signaling the end of the foggy period and the onset of clearer, drier conditions.
