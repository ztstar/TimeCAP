Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. A notable atmospheric pressure drop occurred in the middle of the night, followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Humidity levels showed high variability, particularly during the early morning, indicating possible fog formation or marine layer influence, which is typical for the region. Wind patterns shifted from strong southerly and westerly flows to more variable and lighter winds later in the day, with a final increase in speed and a shift toward the west-southwest in the evening. These conditions point to a dynamic transition period, likely driven by coastal upwelling and frontal activity, contributing to cooler, foggy mornings and clearer, breezier evenings.
