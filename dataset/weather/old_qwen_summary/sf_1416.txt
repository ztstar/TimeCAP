Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to more moderate daytime temperatures. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the overnight hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of significant storm systems or frontal passage in the region. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late morning and afternoon, with strong, consistent winds from the southwest and west, suggesting a prevailing onshore flow that may have brought in marine air and maintained cooler conditions. Combined with persistent high humidity and shifting wind directions, these conditions point to a classic marine influence, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate and the likelihood of foggy mornings and cool afternoons.
