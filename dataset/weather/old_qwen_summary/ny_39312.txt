Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, coinciding with increasing wind speeds and shifting wind directions, suggesting the arrival of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening and overnight, with sustained gusts from the northeast, likely bringing precipitation. The subsequent rise in pressure and shift toward more variable wind patterns suggest the system is moving out, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
