Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that likely reflects the influence of a nocturnal air mass or approaching weather system. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at saturation, which suggests favorable conditions for fog formation or prolonged cloud cover. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, particularly in the final hours, signaling the potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind speeds remained consistently low, but wind direction shifted from easterly to northerly, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. Combined, these indicators point to an increasing likelihood of precipitation and overcast conditions in the near term.
