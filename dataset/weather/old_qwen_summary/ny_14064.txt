Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern with a cold night and warming day. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours and remained elevated through the morning, then plummeted sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely due to warming air and changing air mass. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the early hours, followed by a sustained increase, which is consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases in the afternoon, and wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the northwest, indicating changing atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest the end of a moist, unstable period and the onset of drier, more stable conditions, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
