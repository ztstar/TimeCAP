Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating increasing solar heating and a potential shift toward a more stable air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple spikes to saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and the likelihood of dew formation or fog during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend, particularly in the afternoon, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, indicating possible circulation changes associated with a developing weather pattern. Collectively, these indicators suggest a transition toward warmer, more humid conditions with improving stability, though lingering moisture and variable winds may support localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
