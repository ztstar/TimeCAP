Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating overnight moisture accumulation, followed by a sharp decline as the day progressed, suggesting clearing skies and drying air. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry, and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts during early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly flows, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable conditions, likely resulting in improved visibility and comfortable daytime temperatures in New York City.
