Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near dawn, indicating increasing moisture content in the air, likely due to stable atmospheric conditions and reduced mixing. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, followed by a prolonged period of near-stationary low pressure, which is often associated with unsettled weather and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained moderate through the night, shifting from southerly to northerly and westerly directions, suggesting the influence of a changing pressure gradient. These combined patterns point to a developing frontal system, raising the likelihood of rain or drizzle in the near term, particularly during the morning hours.
