Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of dew or fog formation, which then declined during the midday as temperatures rose, reflecting a drying trend. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, including a sharp drop during the early morning and another during the late evening, signaling the passage of weather systems, potentially associated with a frontal boundary or convective activity. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening, particularly around midnight, accompanied by variable wind directions, indicating shifting airflow patterns consistent with storm development or a low-pressure system influence. The combination of high nighttime humidity, falling pressure, and elevated wind speeds raises the likelihood of thunderstorm potential later in the day, warranting caution for residents.
