Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a milder day. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, particularly during the lowest temperature phase. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts observed, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to an evolving weather pattern, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
