Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a more stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable direction, including southerly and westerly flows, which may signal the approach of a boundary or frontal influence. The combination of rising pressure, declining humidity, and sustained winds points to improving conditions, with a likely transition toward a drier, more stable atmosphere in the coming hours.
