Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily into the lower end of the range before beginning a gradual rise in the afternoon. Humidity remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, then declined sharply in the midday hours, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early morning, peaking in the midday, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system. Wind activity intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These combined patterns point to a developing weather shift, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or a change in air mass, which could bring unsettled conditions later in the day.
