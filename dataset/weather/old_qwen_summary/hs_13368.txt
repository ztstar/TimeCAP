Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking during the night before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the final hours, indicating a possible weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, which may signal the onset of a change in airflow patterns. Together, these indicators suggest a transition phase in Houston’s weather, potentially paving the way for unstable conditions or precipitation later in the day.
