Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady temperature increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and humidity dropped significantly in the mid-to-late afternoon. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a recovery and then another decline later in the day, hinting at a possible passing weather system or front. Wind speeds increased steadily in the evening, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, which may indicate changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, moist boundary layer to a more dynamic and potentially unstable environment, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
