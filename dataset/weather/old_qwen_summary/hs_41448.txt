Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning before dropping sharply in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying due to mixing and warming. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early afternoon, stabilizing at a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clearer skies and reduced storm potential. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and east, accompanied by variable wind directions that reflect changing circulation patterns near surface boundaries. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a damp, stable nocturnal period to a drier, slightly more dynamic daytime regime, with little indication of severe weather but potential for heat accumulation during the coming day.
