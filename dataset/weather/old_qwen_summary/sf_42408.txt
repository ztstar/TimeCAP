Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours and plummeting during midday, indicating the presence of fog or stratus clouds followed by clearing conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with minor fluctuations suggesting a weak, persistent weather system influencing the region without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic local circulation, possibly linked to coastal upwelling or sea breeze effects. These patterns point to a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate and likely contributed to fog formation overnight and clearing in the afternoon.
