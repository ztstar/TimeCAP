Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and staying near saturation, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistently low, but wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a coastal fog event, with the persistent high humidity and cooling temperatures likely contributing to dense fog formation, particularly during the overnight hours.
