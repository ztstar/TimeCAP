Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to increased cloud cover or fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, particularly around dawn, followed by a period of sustained low pressure, which is indicative of a developing or passing weather system capable of bringing precipitation. Wind speeds remained low through the night and early morning, with a shift to stronger winds in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then back to the southeast, implying a change in pressure gradient and possible frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
