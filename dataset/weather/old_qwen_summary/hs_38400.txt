Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of a warm air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight but dropped slightly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to south-southwest in the afternoon, indicating a change in airflow patterns.
