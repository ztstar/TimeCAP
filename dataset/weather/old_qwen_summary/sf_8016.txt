Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained largely stable, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the region, consistent with stable, coastal conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from the southwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a possible sea breeze influence. The combination of high humidity, low wind, and cooling temperatures points to a strong likelihood of lingering fog or low cloud cover, especially in the early morning hours.
