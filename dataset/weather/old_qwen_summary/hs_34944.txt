Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to cool. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early and middle portions of the period, then declined significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely linked to increasing solar heating and changing wind patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a slight decrease in the afternoon, which may indicate the approach of a weakening low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more easterly and southeasterly, potentially signaling a change in airflow associated with regional weather dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable, warmer, and drier conditions, though residual moisture and wind shifts could support localized afternoon showers.
