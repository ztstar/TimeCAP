Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a continuous decrease through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before slowly rising again, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the mid-to-late night, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west sectors, potentially enhancing cooling and dispersing moisture. The combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns indicates a dynamic weather transition, possibly leading to precipitation or storm development later in the day.
