Temperature dropped significantly during the early hours, indicating a strong cold front passage, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the latter half of the period, peaking toward the end, suggesting increasing moisture content in the air. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, then a notable decline in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low initially, strengthened slightly in the evening, and shifted in direction from northwest to southeast, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined shifts point to a transition from cold, dry conditions to a more unstable, moist environment, potentially leading to precipitation or storm development in the coming hours.
