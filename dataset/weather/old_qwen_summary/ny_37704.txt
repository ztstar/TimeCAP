Temperature trends indicate a steady decline overnight, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning hours, suggesting a cold front passed through during the night. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night, dropping sharply in the early morning before rebounding, which may signal the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions consistent with approaching or ongoing weather changes. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from northerly to southerly and then easterly flows, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air. These combined factors suggest the city experienced a cold, damp night with potential for variable conditions, including possible precipitation or fog, especially during the early morning hours.
