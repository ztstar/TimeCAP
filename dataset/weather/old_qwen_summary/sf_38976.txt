Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a marked shift, peaking during the early morning hours and then declining through the day, indicating a transition from a moist, fog-prone environment to a drier, more stable air mass. Air pressure remained relatively high during the night and early morning, suggesting stable conditions, but a notable drop occurred in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weather change. Wind speeds increased substantially in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest, likely enhancing coastal mixing and contributing to the clearing of fog. The shift in wind direction from the north/northeast to the west/southwest suggests the influence of a developing offshore flow, which may lead to improved visibility and milder conditions in the coming hours.
