Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the middle of the period, followed by a recovery, which is consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system bringing unstable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to stronger and more directional, especially in the late evening, with sustained winds from the southeast and east, likely contributing to the cooling and moisture transport. These combined factors imply a dynamic weather transition, potentially leading to overcast skies, a chance of light precipitation, and cooler conditions in the immediate forecast.
