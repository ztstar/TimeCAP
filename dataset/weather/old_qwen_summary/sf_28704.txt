Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by maritime conditions. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation before plummeting sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to dry, clear skies. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, then spiked significantly in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds remained low and consistent overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicative of changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cool, fog-prone marine layer to a drier, more stable afternoon regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns during the summer months.
