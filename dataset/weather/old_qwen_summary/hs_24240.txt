Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking and remaining high through the early morning hours, indicating a saturated air mass likely associated with a stalled front or boundary. Air pressure steadily increased through the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, hinting at a change in air mass flow. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity.
