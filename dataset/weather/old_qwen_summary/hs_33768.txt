Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming period in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more stable air. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, remaining elevated throughout the day, which suggests the influence of a high-pressure system bringing clear and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low, generally below 3 m/s, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly in the early hours, then turning toward the southwest and later the southeast, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These conditions point to a dry, settled weather regime with minimal precipitation risk, favorable for outdoor activities but potentially conducive to heat accumulation during the warmer afternoon hours.
