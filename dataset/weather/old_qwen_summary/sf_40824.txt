Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the early hours. A significant wind shift occurred around midday, with strong gusts from the southwest, coinciding with a sharp drop in air pressure and later a recovery, indicating the passage of a weather system. The wind direction transitioned from westerly to southerly and then to more easterly, suggesting changing synoptic influences, possibly linked to coastal upwelling or a shifting pressure gradient. These patterns point to a dynamic coastal environment with strong diurnal cycles, where marine layer effects dominate, especially during the overnight hours, influencing both temperature and fog development.
