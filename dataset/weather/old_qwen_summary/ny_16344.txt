Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, then declined as temperatures warmed, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clear and stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to southwest, hinting at changing air flow patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a shift toward drier, more settled conditions with improving visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
