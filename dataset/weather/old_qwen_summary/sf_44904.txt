The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has remained remarkably stable, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent conditions suggest a persistent high-pressure system is dominating the region, contributing to dry and calm atmospheric conditions. Low humidity levels indicate a lack of moisture in the air, which can amplify daytime heating and reduce the likelihood of precipitation. The steady wind from the southeast has maintained a gentle, unidirectional flow, reinforcing the stability of the current weather regime. These factors together point to a prolonged period of clear skies and mild conditions, typical of San Francisco’s characteristic coastal climate during stable periods.
