Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or misty conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase through the midday and early evening, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, with a slight intensification in the late evening and night, associated with shifting wind directions from the west and southwest, typical of marine layer dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and moderate winds points to the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of a more stable, sunnier regime likely to persist into the coming hours.
