Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure rose significantly in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts coming from the west and northwest, consistent with a shift in wind patterns typical of coastal sea breeze dynamics. Combined, these trends point to a transition from a cooler, more humid coastal air mass to a drier, more stable regime, likely resulting in clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day.
