Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily declining, suggesting the presence of fog or condensation that likely dissipated as temperatures climbed. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a slow recovery, points to the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought precipitation or overcast conditions earlier in the day. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest and later to southeast, consistent with changing airflow patterns associated with the passing system. The combination of these indicators suggests a dynamic weather transition, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
