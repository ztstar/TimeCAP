Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking during midday before gradually declining into the early morning hours, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching near saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the predawn period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were strongest during the morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns possibly linked to a sea breeze or pressure gradient shift. These conditions point to a transition from coastal fog and cool marine air to a drier, slightly warmer afternoon, consistent with typical afternoon clearing in the Bay Area.
