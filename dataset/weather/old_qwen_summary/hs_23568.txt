Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air, likely from nocturnal condensation or a nearby frontal boundary. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from the southeast to the southwest, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow that could influence storm development. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing warmth and humidity potentially supporting afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
