Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in Houston showed a significant overnight drop, followed by a gradual rebound during the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase starting in the late morning, culminating in a sustained rise that may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, contributing to improving weather conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout most of the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from a southeasterly to a more northerly orientation, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime pattern, likely reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
