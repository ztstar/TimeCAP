Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the potential for fog or low clouds during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong synoptic-scale disturbances, but a slight rise in the afternoon may hint at improving conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in direction from southerly to easterly during the night, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions together point to a stable, humid environment with elevated dew points, increasing the likelihood of a muggy feel and possible scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
