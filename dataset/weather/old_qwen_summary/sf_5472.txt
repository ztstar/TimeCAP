Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the early morning hours, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which is consistent with fog formation due to temperature inversion and high moisture content near the surface. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with strong westerly to southwesterly gusts, suggesting the influence of offshore flow and katabatic effects from nearby topography. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, though a brief rise in pressure during midday may signal a temporary subsidence or shift in synoptic conditions. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to persistent fog and low cloud cover, particularly in the early morning, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s temperate coastal climate.
