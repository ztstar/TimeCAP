Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low just before dawn, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content during nighttime and early morning hours, suggesting potential for fog or damp conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise slightly, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and midday, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, consistent with a developing storm system or frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind, and high humidity points to a recent or ongoing weather disturbance that could have led to precipitation, with conditions now stabilizing as pressure begins to recover.
