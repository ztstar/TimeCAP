Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, aligning with a typical coastal pattern as the marine layer evolved. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and a shift in wind direction points to the dissipation of fog and improving visibility, signaling a transition toward clearer skies by late evening.
