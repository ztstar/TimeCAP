Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. A sharp increase in humidity, peaking at 100% during the early morning hours, suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to radiative cooling and high moisture content. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the night and into the morning, followed by a slight recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and unstable atmospheric conditions potentially increasing the risk of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
