Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of nocturnal dew formation and subsequent drying during daylight. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the period, particularly accelerating in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and remained elevated, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, potentially indicating inflow from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—suggest the potential for developing convective activity, with a heightened likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
