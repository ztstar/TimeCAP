Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, particularly in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then to the west, suggesting changing airflow patterns influenced by coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a transition from foggy, cool marine influence toward clearer, slightly warmer skies as the high-pressure ridge strengthens.
