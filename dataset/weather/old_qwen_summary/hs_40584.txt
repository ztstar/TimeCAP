Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining through the day, indicating possible moisture influx followed by dispersion. Air pressure rose steadily from mid-morning onward, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the day, with weaker winds in the early morning and increased variability later, including a brief shift to stronger gusts in the late afternoon. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns that may have influenced the movement of moisture and the development of localized weather features.
