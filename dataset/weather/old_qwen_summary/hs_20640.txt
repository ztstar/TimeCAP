Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply through the day, suggesting moisture accumulation overnight and subsequent drying due to warming and increased wind. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing during the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more westerly, consistent with the influence of an approaching high-pressure ridge. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and supporting clearer skies in the near term.
