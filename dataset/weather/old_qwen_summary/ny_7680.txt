Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in thermal dynamics likely linked to changing air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight and remained elevated through the early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation, which may have contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, but a notable shift in wind direction occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation that could precede a weather change. These patterns collectively imply that New York City is transitioning from a moist, cool, and stable environment toward potentially clearer skies, though residual humidity may lead to lingering fog or drizzle in the morning hours.
