Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of nighttime cooling likely influenced by high humidity and cloud cover. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and likely suppressed daytime warming. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These patterns collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, though lingering moisture may still support the potential for isolated showers later in the day.
