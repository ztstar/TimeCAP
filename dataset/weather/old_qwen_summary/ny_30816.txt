Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold overnight period followed by a modest warming trend. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining high, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour period, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds from the west and northwest, likely associated with a developing weather front. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and a significant drop in humidity later in the day implies a transition toward drier, more stable air, potentially signaling improving weather conditions for the remainder of the day.
