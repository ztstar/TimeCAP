Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the same period, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with a front. Wind speeds diminished to near calm conditions during the early morning hours, indicating a temporary lull, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west. These combined patterns point to the influence of a developing weather disturbance, increasing the likelihood of scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
