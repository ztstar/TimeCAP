Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a slight warming in the late afternoon, indicating a dynamic thermal profile likely influenced by changing air masses. Humidity levels rose steadily after midday, peaking in the evening and remaining elevated, suggesting increasing moisture content in the lower atmosphere conducive to potential precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the period, particularly in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a developing frontal boundary. Combined, these trends point to a heightened likelihood of thunderstorms or showery conditions in the near term, especially during the overnight hours.
