Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or drizzle, especially in low-lying areas. Air pressure continued to decrease steadily, reflecting an approaching low-pressure system that could bring prolonged precipitation. Wind speeds increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more northerly wind directions, possibly signaling the influence of a frontal boundary. Given these trends, the city is likely under the influence of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the risk of scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
