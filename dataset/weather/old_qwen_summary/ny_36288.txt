Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cool night with a warming trend as daylight advanced. Humidity levels remained low through the night, rising significantly in the late morning and peaking in the early evening, suggesting increasing moisture in the air that could contribute to fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds exhibited notable variability, with a sharp increase in the early morning hours followed by sustained moderate to strong winds, particularly from the northwest and west sectors, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. The combination of dropping temperatures, rising humidity, and persistent wind suggests a transitioning weather pattern that may lead to overcast conditions or light showers later in the day.
