Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply during the afternoon before rebounding again in the evening, suggesting the influence of localized moisture influx and possible convective activity. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, then declining notably in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted dramatically in the late afternoon, with speed increasing and direction changing from northeasterly to southerly and westerly, consistent with a developing frontal boundary or storm system. These combined trends point to an active weather transition, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms and potentially disruptive conditions in the coming hours.
