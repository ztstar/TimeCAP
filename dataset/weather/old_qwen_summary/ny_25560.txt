Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels surged significantly in the overnight period, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or low clouds during the early hours, possibly reducing visibility. A steady drop in air pressure throughout the day, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, signals the approach of a low-pressure system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation or stormy conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably from a consistent southerly to westerly and then northerly flow, with increased speed in the late evening, potentially indicating a change in frontal activity. Combined, these trends point to an evolving weather situation with increasing instability, raising the probability of unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
