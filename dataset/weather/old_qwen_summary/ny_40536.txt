Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回暖 in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation around dawn, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a cooler feel. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-range during the day—this decline is often associated with approaching low-pressure systems and possible precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching notable levels, driven by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the east and southeast, consistent with a developing frontal passage. Combined, these patterns point to a transition in weather, with the potential for showers or light rain in the near term as a low-pressure system moves through the region.
