Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, then declined steadily through the day, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable and clear skies. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with peak gusts in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing circulation. These conditions point to a drying trend and improving weather, with reduced chances of precipitation and increased comfort during the day, though lingering winds may contribute to higher evaporation rates.
