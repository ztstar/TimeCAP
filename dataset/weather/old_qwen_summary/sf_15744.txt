Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, which suggests the presence of fog or low stratus clouds that likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure remained nearly constant until midday, when a slight increase occurred, potentially signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late evening, driven by shifting wind directions from northwest to southwest, consistent with onshore flow patterns common in the region. These combined conditions point to a transition from a foggy, cool maritime environment toward a drier, more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
