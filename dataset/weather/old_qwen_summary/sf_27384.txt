Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning and again in the late evening, indicating the presence of fog or moist air masses, particularly during the overnight hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating a complex flow pattern, likely influenced by coastal dynamics and topography. These combined factors point to a transition period characterized by maritime influence, possible fog development, and the potential for unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
