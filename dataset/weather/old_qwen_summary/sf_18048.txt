Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels rose sharply through the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, consistent with the region’s marine layer behavior. Air pressure showed a sustained downward trend, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing circulation patterns associated with the evolving pressure gradient. Combined, these factors point to a persistent marine influence, with conditions favorable for fog and cool, damp weather, particularly in the early morning and overnight hours.
