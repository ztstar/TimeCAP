Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during midday, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south and southeast during the late afternoon indicate a change in atmospheric circulation, likely tied to a passing frontal system. Air pressure dropped sharply in the early hours, then stabilized and rose later in the day, consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system followed by high-pressure reinforcement. These dynamics suggest a shift from maritime influence to a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improved visibility and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
