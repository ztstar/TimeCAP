Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and remaining near their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rise. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning, persisting at 100% for several hours, indicating the presence of fog or dense low-lying cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, peaking in the late afternoon and suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from midday onward, with stronger gusts coming from the south and southeast, potentially enhancing coastal ventilation and dispersing fog. The shift in wind direction from predominantly west and southwest to more southeasterly patterns in the evening may signal changing synoptic conditions, possibly indicating a transition in local weather dynamics.
