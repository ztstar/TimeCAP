Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool nocturnal conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the night and early morning, then steadily decreased into the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure demonstrated a consistent upward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained moderate and relatively constant, with a consistent direction from the northwest to west-northwest, reinforcing the presence of a stable maritime influence typical of the region’s coastal climate. Together, these patterns indicate a developing period of stable, dry, and mild conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and comfortable outdoor conditions in the near term.
