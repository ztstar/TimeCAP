Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady decline, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the night and early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely linked to precipitation potential. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with dynamic boundary layer activity and potential for gusty conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly suggests changing synoptic-scale flow, possibly associated with a departing low-pressure system and the establishment of a more northerly flow ahead of a new weather pattern.
