Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp recovery in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by air mass drying. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest, accompanying a shift in wind direction toward more southerly and westerly flows, consistent with a developing onshore flow or storm system. These combined indicators suggest a transition in weather patterns, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions, increased cloud development, or even thunderstorm activity later in the day.
