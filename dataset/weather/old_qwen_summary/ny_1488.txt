Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with a notable spike to saturation in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a temporary lull during the night, followed by a resurgence in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly. These combined factors point to an active weather front moving through the region, increasing the likelihood of rain or showers in the near term, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours.
