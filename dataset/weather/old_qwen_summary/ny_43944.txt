Temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of daytime solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, coinciding with a drop in temperature, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible change in weather patterns. Wind speeds intensified in the evening, particularly from the southeast and south, indicating shifting airflow that could bring in warmer, moister air. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing pressure, and increasing wind suggests the potential for unstable conditions, possibly leading to thunderstorms or a warm front influence later in the day.
