Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily during the afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the day, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests a moist air mass persisted, enhancing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal activity but consistent atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, indicating a possible change in circulation patterns. These conditions together suggest a high likelihood of localized convective activity later in the day, particularly if daytime heating continues to intensify.
