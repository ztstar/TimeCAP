Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising toward midday. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent high-pressure influence, though a slight dip occurred during the overnight hours. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to a northerly flow, which likely contributed to the cooling and moisture influx. These conditions collectively suggest a coastal fog event driven by marine air intrusion, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly affecting the early morning and late evening periods.
