Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. A sharp decline in humidity during the same period, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, suggests the presence of fog or low clouds that have since dissipated. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the afternoon, reaching a peak before slightly declining, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of calm and shifts in wind direction indicating localized or transient weather patterns, possibly linked to topographical effects. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, cool, and stable coastal environment toward clearer, warmer, and more variable conditions later in the day.
