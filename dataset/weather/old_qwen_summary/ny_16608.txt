Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler nighttime period to a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased slightly in the early morning before decreasing again in the late afternoon, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a frontal boundary, with clearing skies and improving conditions likely developing in the coming hours.
