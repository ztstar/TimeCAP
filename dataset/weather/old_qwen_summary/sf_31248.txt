Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A sharp increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought more stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the overnight hours, driven by strong southerly and westerly gusts, which likely facilitated the inland movement of marine air. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a classic marine layer event, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with potential for foggy mornings and mild afternoons.
