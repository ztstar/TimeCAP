Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night, indicating persistent fog and low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and limited solar heating. A significant rise in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that may be suppressing further cloud development and promoting clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting changing air flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest the transition from a foggy, cool night to a more stable, drier, and slightly breezier day ahead.
