- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced decline after peaking in the early morning, indicating a significant drying trend throughout the day. A notable anomaly occurred in the late afternoon, with a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting possible atmospheric changes or weather system movement. This pattern implies increasing comfort levels and potential for clearing skies, which may influence outdoor activity planning and air quality dynamics.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a steady upward trend over the initial 16 hours, indicating improving atmospheric stability and potential for fair weather conditions. A sustained plateau at a high value was followed by a brief decline, suggesting possible dynamic changes in local air mass or approaching weather systems. The subsequent recovery and stabilization imply resilience in the high-pressure system, likely reinforcing continued stable conditions in the region.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature trend over the past 24 hours shows a steady decline during the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing through the late morning and afternoon. A notable reversal occurred around midday, with a sustained rise followed by a slight plateau and minor fluctuation, indicating stabilization in thermal conditions. The overall pattern suggests a diurnal cycle influenced by atmospheric conditions, with implications for energy demand, public comfort, and potential weather changes.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a gradual increase during the first half of the 24-hour period, peaking in the mid-range before a sharp decline toward the latter half. A prolonged period of minimal wind activity occurred in the final 12 hours, indicating a significant stabilization or lull in atmospheric movement. This pattern suggests a transition from dynamic wind conditions to calm, potentially signaling the influence of a high-pressure system or a temporary weather front dissipation.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a consistent shift from westerly to northerly sectors over the initial 12 hours, suggesting a possible change in upper-level flow or frontal influence. A notable reversal occurred around the 16th hour, with a sharp transition to southerly and easterly values, indicating a potential low-pressure system or wind shift event impacting the region. The return to northeasterly winds in the final hours, coupled with a brief dip near zero degrees, implies possible cyclonic circulation or local terrain effects, which may contribute to changing weather conditions such as precipitation or temperature shifts.
