Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent drop in the early morning, followed by a recovery and a slight drop again in the late evening, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speed and direction exhibited a marked change in the afternoon, with stronger and more variable winds emerging, particularly from the southwest and west, potentially indicating the influence of a developing or approaching weather disturbance. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing instability and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
