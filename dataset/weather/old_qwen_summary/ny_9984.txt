Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure has been observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting a warming trend likely driven by changing air masses and increasing solar exposure. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning hours, peaking during the night, which enhances the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speed remained constant, but the consistent wind direction from the southwest suggests a sustained flow of moist air into the region. Collectively, these indicators point to an elevated risk of rain or storms in the near term, particularly during the early hours of the following day.
