Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with a sharp rise followed by a decline, indicating the passage of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure front. Wind speeds and directions revealed strong, shifting winds during the night and early morning, with southerly and westerly flows dominating, consistent with marine layer activity and coastal influence. These combined indicators point to a dynamic coastal weather regime typical of San Francisco, with frequent microclimatic shifts driven by oceanic and topographic factors.
