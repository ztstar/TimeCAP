Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cloud cover and morning solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of a stable, moist boundary layer likely contributing to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise overnight, followed by a drop in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the passage of a weather system—possibly a frontal boundary—that may have brought moist air and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southeasterly during the day, consistent with a change in pressure gradient and possible inflow of Gulf moisture. Together, these indicators point to a transition period marked by high humidity, unstable atmospheric conditions, and the potential for thunderstorms later in the day, particularly during peak heating hours.
