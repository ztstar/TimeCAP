Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and low visibility. A notable pressure increase occurred in the early hours, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system, which may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns possibly linked to coastal dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind direction points to a strong marine layer influence, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns during the transitional season.
