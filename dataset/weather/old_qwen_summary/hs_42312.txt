Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from nighttime moisture accumulation to drier conditions driven by daytime heating. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system or localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, with a notable shift toward more variable and lower speeds during the afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, potentially indicating changing air mass influences. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a stable, moist nighttime environment to a drier, warming daytime regime, with minor synoptic-scale influences possibly affecting local wind patterns.
