Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend into the early afternoon, suggesting a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely due to clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which later diminished during the day as conditions dried out. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline in the late evening and early morning, followed by a rebound, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased wind and fog. Wind speeds spiked during the late evening and early morning, with a sustained period of strong winds from the south and southeast, likely due to coastal inflow and pressure gradients, enhancing the cooling effect and dispersing fog. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then back to southerly suggests dynamic changes in airflow, potentially linked to a developing marine layer and the influence of regional topography.
