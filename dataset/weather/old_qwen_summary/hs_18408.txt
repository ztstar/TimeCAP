Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and low wind conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point maximum and subsequent drying due to solar heating. Air pressure remained stable with minor fluctuations, showing no signs of a strong frontal system passing through, which implies generally stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low, with brief bursts during the day, and wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors, indicating a weak pressure gradient and possible localized circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a calm, stable environment with high morning moisture that could increase the chance of fog or low clouds early in the day, followed by partly sunny conditions as the day progresses.
