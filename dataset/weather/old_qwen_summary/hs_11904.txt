Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, likely driven by nocturnal radiative cooling and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and favorable conditions for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, especially during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, potentially indicating the influence of a front or developing low-level circulation. The combination of high humidity, falling temperatures, and variable wind patterns suggests a heightened likelihood of fog development and possible thunderstorm initiation if instability increases later.
