Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nighttime cooling trend that reversed during the morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate with variable direction, shifting from easterly to westerly, which may have facilitated the movement of cooler air into the region. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing temperature, and fluctuating wind patterns points to a transitioning weather regime, likely leading to improved conditions with lower chances of precipitation.
