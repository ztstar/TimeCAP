Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly declining. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a heightened potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, particularly during midday and into the evening, signaling the approach of a more stable air mass. Wind patterns fluctuated significantly, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south in the late afternoon and evening, which may have contributed to the transport of moist air into the region. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm development, especially given the warm, humid conditions and increasing wind shear.
