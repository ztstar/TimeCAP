Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable, warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before beginning to decline, which suggests the presence of moist air masses. A steady drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then southwesterly, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate but increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with strengthening surface convergence. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern that could lead to increased cloud cover and a higher likelihood of scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
