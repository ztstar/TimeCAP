Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the onset of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical for the region's coastal climate. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the stabilization and clearing of fog during the late morning. Wind speeds increased during the night, particularly from northwest to west directions, reinforcing marine layer development, before diminishing in the afternoon as the system weakened. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late evening hints at a potential change in airflow, possibly signaling the beginning of a transition in the local weather pattern.
