Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the early morning hours. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which persisted through early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting a lack of strong weather systems moving through the region. Wind speeds increased noticeably during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west, likely contributing to the cooling and moistening of the air. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and steady winds points to a persistent marine layer, which is typical for San Francisco’s coastal climate and may continue to suppress daytime warming.
