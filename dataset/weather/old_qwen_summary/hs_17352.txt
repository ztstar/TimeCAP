Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining near saturation, which increases the perception of heat and may contribute to discomfort. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the east-southeast, suggesting the potential for localized convective activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a heightened risk of thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if additional instability develops.
