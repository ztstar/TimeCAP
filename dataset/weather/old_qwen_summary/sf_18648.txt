Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity reached saturation levels during the night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, which persisted into the early hours of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with slight dips during the early morning, suggesting minimal dynamic weather system influence. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the late afternoon and remained low through the evening, with winds shifting slightly toward the northeast, consistent with a weakening marine layer. The combination of near-saturation humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a persistent marine layer and potential for lingering fog or low clouds in the morning hours.
