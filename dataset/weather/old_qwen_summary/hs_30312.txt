Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, with a sharp decline in the midday hours. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease throughout the period, reaching a low point in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing notably in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling the onset of a new air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more active weather, possibly including thunderstorms, in the near term.
