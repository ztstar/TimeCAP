Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early hours, remaining at or near 100% for a prolonged period, indicating strong fog formation or persistent low-level moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day before a slight drop in the final hours, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light to moderate, with a notable decrease during the overnight hours, while wind direction shifted progressively from west-southwest to east-northeast, reflecting a change in airflow pattern. These conditions together point to the influence of a maritime air mass, likely contributing to foggy and cool conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with a possible transition toward clearer skies later in the day.
