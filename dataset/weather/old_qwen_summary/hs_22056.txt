Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming phase into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal systems, consistent with a stable high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south and then southwest, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a warm, humid afternoon with increasing wind activity, potentially enhancing heat discomfort and influencing any localized storm development.
