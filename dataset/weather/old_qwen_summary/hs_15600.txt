Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of saturated air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed throughout the day, with the lowest values recorded in the late night, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to easterly and then northerly directions, with increased wind speeds in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with changing frontal dynamics. These combined indicators suggest a transition in weather conditions, with potential for instability and precipitation development later in the day.
