Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the early morning hours and a steady rise through the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of dense fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. A notable drop in air pressure occurred toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind activity was sporadic, with brief bursts of stronger winds from the west and southwest during the early morning and late afternoon, possibly aiding in the mixing of air and dispersion of fog. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a coastal marine influence, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate behavior.
