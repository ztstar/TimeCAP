Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining significantly during the day, indicating a drying trend as the atmosphere stabilized. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with the approach of a cold front. These combined patterns point to a transition period where a stable high-pressure system is consolidating, likely bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
