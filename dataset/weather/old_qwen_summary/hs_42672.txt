Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels climbed significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight rise in the late afternoon may hint at clearing skies. Wind speeds were moderate to low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, possibly signaling changing air mass influence. Together, these trends suggest a warm, humid night transitioning into a drier, more stable afternoon, with potential for clearer skies later in the day.
