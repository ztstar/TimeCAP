Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a distinct two-phase weather pattern: a period of cooling and rising humidity followed by a warming trend and drying air. The initial phase showed a steady decline in temperature and a corresponding increase in humidity, indicating the arrival of a moist air mass, likely associated with a low-pressure system. This was followed by a significant temperature rebound and a sharp drop in humidity, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system bringing drier, warmer air. Wind speeds diminished through the night and early morning, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more northerly and then westerly direction, reflecting a transition in air mass circulation. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing moisture, and decreasing wind speeds points to improving conditions, with stable, clear skies likely developing in the coming hours.
