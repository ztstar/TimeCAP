Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure was observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which typically brings unsettled weather. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, suggesting the likelihood of precipitation or foggy conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling throughout the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, consistent with nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar warming. Wind patterns displayed significant variability, with strong southerly and easterly flows during the early hours, transitioning to more variable and generally weaker winds later, possibly indicating a change in atmospheric dynamics. Combined, these indicators suggest that New York City experienced a shift toward unstable, moist conditions, increasing the potential for rain or overcast skies in the near term.
