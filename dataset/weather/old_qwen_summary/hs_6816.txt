Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to increased cloud formation or the potential for isolated showers. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the early morning, followed by a gradual decline through the afternoon, which may reflect the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a change in air mass. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, indicating a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the atmosphere was transitioning from a stable, moist, and cooling phase to a drier, warming, and more stable regime, with minimal immediate threat of severe weather but possible localized convection if moisture persists.
