Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with prolonged periods of near-saturated conditions, especially during the overnight and early morning hours, increasing the likelihood of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a slight decrease toward the end of the period, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric stability, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the day, with gusts from the northwest and northeast quadrants, suggesting a change in circulation patterns that may influence storm development. Combined with the persistent high humidity and fluctuating wind directions, these conditions create an environment conducive to the formation of thunderstorms, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours.
