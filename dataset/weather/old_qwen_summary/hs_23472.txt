Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the late night and early morning, signaling the influence of a weak high-pressure system that likely contributed to calm and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable reduction in the early morning hours, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly and then back to southerly, indicating changing local flow patterns possibly related to surface heating and pressure gradients. These combined conditions suggest a transition toward more humid and potentially unstable air in the coming hours, increasing the likelihood of isolated afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if daytime heating intensifies.
