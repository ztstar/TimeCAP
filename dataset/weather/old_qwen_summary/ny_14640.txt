Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, indicating a saturated atmosphere, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours signaled the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have brought overcast skies and increased chances of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with calm conditions in the early morning giving way to variable, light winds later in the day, suggesting a changeable and unstable air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and fluctuating pressure points to a transition toward clearer skies and potentially more stable weather in the coming hours.
