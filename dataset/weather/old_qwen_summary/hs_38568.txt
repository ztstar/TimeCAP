Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a dramatic spike during the night, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or dew, particularly in the pre-dawn hours. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around mid-morning, transitioning from a northerly to a southerly flow, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system or frontal passage. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and consistent wind speeds points to improving weather conditions, with a reduced likelihood of precipitation and a shift toward drier, more comfortable air.
