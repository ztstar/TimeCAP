Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating saturated air and potential for fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late evening, which suggests the approach of a low-pressure system and possible storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions and elevated moisture, these conditions suggest an increased likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the coming hours.
