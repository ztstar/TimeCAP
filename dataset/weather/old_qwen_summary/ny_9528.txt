Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking in the early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to easterly by dawn, indicating a change in airflow pattern. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation but possible morning fog due to high humidity and cooling.
