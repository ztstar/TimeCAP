Over the past 20 market days, equity markets exhibited a generally upward trend, with strong momentum in the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, suggesting renewed investor confidence despite short-term volatility. The VIX showed a notable decline after an early spike, reflecting reduced market fear and a shift toward stability, though it remains sensitive to macroeconomic shifts. Global equity indices, particularly in Japan and Europe, demonstrated resilience and steady gains, indicating broad-based strength beyond U.S. markets. Commodity prices, especially gold and crude oil, trended higher amid rising demand expectations and geopolitical concerns, while the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and yen, signaling potential shifts in global capital flows. The Chinese yuan’s gradual depreciation and persistent euro-dollar stability suggest ongoing pressure on emerging market currencies and cautious sentiment in Asia, warranting close monitoring for future policy responses.
