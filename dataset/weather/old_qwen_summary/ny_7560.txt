Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying due to increased solar heating and wind activity. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point before stabilizing and slightly rising, which may signal the influence of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with near-zero values indicating calm conditions, but increased in the afternoon, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the evolving system. Wind direction shifted dramatically during the night, transitioning from southwest to northwest and later to southeast, reflecting complex local circulation changes possibly linked to frontal passage or urban heat island effects.
