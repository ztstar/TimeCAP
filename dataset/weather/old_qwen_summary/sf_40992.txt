Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late morning, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed fluctuating patterns, with a notable rise in the early morning hours suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to improving conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon, especially during the evening hours, with a strong shift in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to coastal dynamics. These combined factors point to a diurnal cycle typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, where marine influence drives temperature moderation and fog formation, followed by clearing skies and breezy conditions as the day progresses.
