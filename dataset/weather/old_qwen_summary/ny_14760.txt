Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before leveling off in the early morning, indicating a cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation as temperatures approached the dew point. Air pressure showed a consistent rise from early morning onward, stabilizing at a high value, pointing to the influence of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northerly, indicating changing air mass influences. Combined, these trends suggest a clear, stable, and cool morning following a damp, fog-prone night, with conditions favorable for a pleasant, dry day ahead.
