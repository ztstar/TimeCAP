Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, with near-saturation levels prevailing for much of the day, indicating a moist and unstable air mass. Temperature remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting limited diurnal variation, which is typical during prolonged cloud cover or overcast conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise, signaling the passage of a weather system, possibly a front or storm complex. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including strong southerly and easterly components, which may have contributed to moisture influx. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and strong winds points to a high probability of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
