Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by surface heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or mist formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early night, followed by a rebound, which may signal the passage of a weather front or disturbance. Wind speeds increased in the late evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a change in air mass and possible storm development. These combined patterns suggest an unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of localized thunderstorms later in the day.
