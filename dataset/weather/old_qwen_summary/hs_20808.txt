Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, indicating a strong temperature drop likely linked to a changing air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning, which suggests saturated atmospheric conditions conducive to fog or reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, a pattern often associated with the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and overnight, with a shift from southerly to more westerly and then northerly directions, signaling a change in wind flow possibly tied to frontal movement. These combined trends point to the influence of a developing weather front, potentially bringing precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
