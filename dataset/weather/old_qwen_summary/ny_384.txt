Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable calm period in the early morning, followed by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast and then to the south-southwest, possibly signaling changing air masses. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and a shift in wind direction suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more stable weather conditions in the coming hours.
