Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the night, reaching a minimum before rising again in the late afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined patterns suggest the city is transitioning into a period of potentially unstable weather, possibly including precipitation later in the day.
