Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period and remaining elevated for several hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating changing flow patterns possibly linked to offshore breezes. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and variable winds suggests a transition toward clearer skies and drier conditions later in the day, consistent with typical afternoon clearing in the Bay Area.
