Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight回暖 in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, remaining high through midday before gradually decreasing, indicating the presence of a persistent marine layer that likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement, though brief increases coincided with wind shifts. Wind speeds intensified notably during the late morning and early evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then southeasterly, potentially signaling a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a typical coastal weather pattern influenced by oceanic air masses, with implications for visibility, comfort, and potential for fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
