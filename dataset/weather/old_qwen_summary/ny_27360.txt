Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier, more stable conditions. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sustained rise in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow in the morning and a shift toward more northerly and easterly directions in the late evening, possibly indicating a change in air mass or frontal passage. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable wind patterns points to improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
