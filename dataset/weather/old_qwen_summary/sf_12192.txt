Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling and afternoon solar heating. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, coinciding with the peak humidity and calm wind conditions, signaling a possible frontal passage or marine layer development. Wind speeds were strongest during midday and early evening, with southerly and westerly flow suggesting onshore breezes, which may have helped disperse fog and stabilize conditions later in the day. The combination of high humidity, variable wind patterns, and pressure shifts points to a dynamic marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with potential for fog persistence in the morning and clearer skies later in the day.
