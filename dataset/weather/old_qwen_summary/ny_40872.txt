Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回暖 through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, then dropped significantly during the afternoon as temperatures climbed, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began a gradual decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions to a more variable and potentially unsettled weather pattern, with possible impacts on visibility and comfort levels.
