Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight rise in the early hours and a gradual decline toward the end, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or approaching frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a peak in the late evening hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south, indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing weather disturbance. These combined dynamics suggest the potential for unsettled weather, including possible precipitation or storm development, particularly in the coming hours.
