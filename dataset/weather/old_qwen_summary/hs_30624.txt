Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked increase in temperature during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, peaking in the early to mid-day hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a sustained decline through the early to mid-day, followed by a brief recovery and another drop, signaling dynamic atmospheric instability likely associated with a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest, aligning with a shift in wind direction that may indicate the approach or passage of a frontal boundary. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and fluctuating pressure and wind patterns points to a developing shift in weather conditions, potentially leading to more variable or stormy weather later in the day.
