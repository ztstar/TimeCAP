Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, followed by a sharp drop as temperatures rose, suggesting clearing skies. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, coinciding with the peak in humidity and wind activity, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around dawn, transitioning from light, variable winds to stronger, more consistent flows from the east and southeast, which may have facilitated the influx of moist air and influenced storm development. These conditions point to an active weather transition, with potential for localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day as warm, moist air continues to build under the influence of the recovering high-pressure system.
