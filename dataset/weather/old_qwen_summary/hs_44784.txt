Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable overnight cooling trend followed by a steady warming during the daytime, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning and late evening, peaking in the late night and early morning, which may have contributed to increased fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and shifting wind directions, hinting at the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined patterns suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term due to the convergence of moist air and dynamic wind shifts.
