Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming period as the day progressed, indicating a developing diurnal cycle likely influenced by changing cloud cover and solar insolation. Humidity levels remained persistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting saturated air conditions that could promote fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a consistent and significant decline throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable weather, including precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, indicative of changing synoptic-scale flow consistent with storm development. These combined factors point to an increased likelihood of precipitation and potentially unsettled conditions over New York City in the near term.
