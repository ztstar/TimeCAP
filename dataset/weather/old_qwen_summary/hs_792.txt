Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rebound in temperatures through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked overnight, reaching saturation conditions that contributed to foggy and damp conditions, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, stabilizing at a high-pressure ridge, which likely suppressed cloud development and supported clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds remained generally low, with calm periods in the early morning and late evening, though a brief surge occurred in the afternoon, possibly indicating a shift in local airflow. The wind direction variability, including a notable shift toward the southwest in the late afternoon, suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather pattern.
