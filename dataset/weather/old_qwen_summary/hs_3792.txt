Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a persistent fog or mist condition in the early hours. A notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly occurred around mid-morning, coinciding with a rise in air pressure, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting strengthening surface-level air movement, likely due to thermal gradients and pressure changes. These dynamics point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a warmer, more dynamic daytime pattern, with potential for scattered afternoon showers or thunderstorms.
