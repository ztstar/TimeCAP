Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a gradual warming trend after a period of cooling, indicating a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours and remained consistently high, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s marine layer. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring increased precipitation or stronger winds. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a notable reduction in the afternoon and early evening, but the wind direction consistently originated from the west to southwest, reinforcing the influence of coastal maritime air. These combined trends point to a developing coastal weather pattern, likely bringing overcast skies and the potential for light rain or drizzle in the coming hours.
