Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle likely driven by coastal fog dissipation and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, coinciding with the temperature drop, suggesting fog formation or increased moisture retention, which then plummeted in the afternoon as temperatures rose and fog cleared. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night before declining slightly, hinting at a subtle atmospheric shift that may have contributed to the morning cooling. Wind speeds increased steadily through the morning, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, supporting the transport of marine air and fog inland, before easing slightly in the afternoon. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast in the late afternoon suggests a change in airflow patterns, potentially signaling the end of coastal fog influence and the onset of drier, warmer conditions.
