Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the mid-morning and early afternoon, followed by a steady decline through the evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to westerly and then to northeasterly directions, with increasing wind speeds in the late evening, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for shifting conditions such as thunderstorm development or a change in cloud cover.
