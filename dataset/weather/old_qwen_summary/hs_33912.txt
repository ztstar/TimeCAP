Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the early and mid-day, followed by a slight decline, which may signal the approach of changing weather patterns. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. Collectively, these trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with warming, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds pointing toward the potential for convective activity or an approaching front.
