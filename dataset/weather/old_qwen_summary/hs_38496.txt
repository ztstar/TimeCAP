Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A steady drop in atmospheric pressure throughout the late night and early morning coincided with increasing humidity and wind activity, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly northwest to more variable directions in the afternoon, with brief periods of stronger gusts, possibly indicating the influence of a passing frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for unstable conditions and scattered showers later in the day.
