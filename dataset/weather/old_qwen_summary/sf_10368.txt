Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply, indicating the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that has since dissipated. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm, particularly during the night, while wind direction showed fluctuating patterns, including shifts from westerly to northerly and easterly components, likely reflecting local microclimates and coastal influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, damp night to a gradually warming and drier day, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather patterns.
