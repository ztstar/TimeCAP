Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before dropping sharply as temperatures climbed, suggesting the onset of drying conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition in weather, with potential for precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
