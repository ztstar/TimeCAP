- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a notable decline during the early hours, followed by a sustained period of low values before a sharp rise in the latter half of the 24-hour period. The data reveals a distinct two-phase pattern: a stable, relatively dry phase interrupted by a significant increase, culminating in elevated and stable conditions. This shift suggests an approaching weather change, potentially indicating moisture influx or changing air mass dynamics, which may influence comfort levels and forecasted precipitation.
- Air Pressure (hPa): The air pressure exhibited a steady upward trend over the initial 18 hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. A peak was reached before a gradual decline over the final six hours, suggesting a possible weakening of the high-pressure influence or the onset of a weather front. The overall pattern reflects dynamic atmospheric adjustments, potentially signaling changing weather conditions in the coming hours.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature trend over the past 24 hours shows a steady decline during the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually recovering, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by a morning rebound. A notable dip in the early morning hours suggests a period of intense heat loss, possibly due to clear skies and low wind, while the subsequent rise points to solar warming and atmospheric stabilization. The data reflects a typical diurnal cycle, with minimal fluctuations after midday, implying stable atmospheric conditions and a lack of significant weather disturbances.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speeds exhibited a pronounced decline throughout the 24-hour period, with peak values observed early in the sequence followed by a sustained reduction to near-zero levels during the latter half. A notable stabilization occurred after the 12th hour, maintaining minimal wind activity with consistent low readings that suggest a developing atmospheric calm or localized wind shadow. This pattern implies a transition from dynamic wind conditions to a quiescent state, which may affect air quality dispersion and could signal the approach or presence of a high-pressure system.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a consistent shift from a northerly to a more easterly and then southerly flow over the initial 12 hours, followed by a marked reversal toward the northeast and east by the 18th hour. A significant abrupt change occurred around the 12th hour, with a transition from westerly to southerly sectors, indicating a possible frontal passage or local atmospheric disturbance. The final hours revealed erratic fluctuations near the eastern and northeastern sectors, suggesting unstable air mass conditions or complex local terrain effects influencing wind patterns.
