Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to recover in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during the overnight period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the increased moisture and deteriorating conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably, transitioning from southerly to westerly and then to a more variable direction, with a temporary lull in wind speed during the early morning hours. These conditions collectively point to the influence of a moist, unstable air mass moving through the region, potentially leading to overcast skies and a chance of light precipitation as the system evolves.
