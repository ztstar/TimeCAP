Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend into the early morning, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to reduced visibility or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a peak before slightly decreasing, which is indicative of a passing high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with a marked increase during the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, cooler nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime atmosphere, with the potential for clearing skies and improved visibility as the high-pressure system consolidates.
