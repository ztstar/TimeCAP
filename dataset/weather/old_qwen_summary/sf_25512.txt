Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, with high values during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which diminished during the day. Air pressure showed a pronounced drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a recovery, indicating a passing weather system that likely brought the observed wind and temperature changes. Wind speeds increased substantially during the evening and overnight, with strong, consistent flow from the west and southwest, contributing to the cooling and fog dissipation. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the final hours suggests a possible change in airflow patterns, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather regime.
