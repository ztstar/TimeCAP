Over the past 24 hours, a gradual cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a sudden increase in wind speed and a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting the approach of a weather system. The sustained high humidity and rising pressure afterward imply the potential for clearing skies and improved conditions later tonight. These changes collectively point to the passage of a frontal system, likely bringing a transition from damp, cooler conditions to drier, more stable weather.
