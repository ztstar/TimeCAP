Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching saturation around dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early hours when wind speeds diminished. A notable shift in atmospheric pressure occurred mid-night, with a sharp drop followed by a rebound, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought brief instability. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around the same time, with a strong southerly surge at night followed by a return to lighter, variable winds in the morning, indicating a change in air mass and possible storm development. The overall pattern suggests a dynamic weather transition, with conditions conducive to localized showers or thunderstorms in the late afternoon or evening.
