Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking at near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and low visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a consistent high-pressure system influence, which typically brings calm and clear conditions. Wind patterns were variable but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and southwest, suggesting a shift in local circulation. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward potentially unsettled conditions, possibly signaling the arrival of coastal fog or a shift in marine layer dynamics.
