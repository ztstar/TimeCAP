Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a marine layer that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and a surge in wind speed, pointing to a possible approaching weather front or low-pressure system. The prevailing wind patterns shifted from offshore to onshore during the evening, which may have contributed to the re-establishment of fog and low clouds. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic transition period, with potential for increased cloud cover and cooler conditions later in the day.
