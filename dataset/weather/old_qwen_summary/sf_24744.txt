Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature dip and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the mid-morning and afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early evening and again in the late night, with shifting wind directions hinting at complex local flow patterns influenced by topography and coastal dynamics. Overall, the data reflect a coastal weather cycle typical of San Francisco, with nighttime cooling, fog development, and a gradual clearing trend driven by reinforcing high pressure.
