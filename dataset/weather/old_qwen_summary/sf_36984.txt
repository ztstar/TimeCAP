Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before sharply declining as temperatures climbed, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather in the coming hours. Wind speeds increased notably in the mid-morning and early evening, particularly from easterly to southerly directions, which may enhance coastal fog advection and contribute to temperature fluctuations. Combined, these trends suggest a dynamic shift in local atmospheric conditions, potentially signaling the onset of a marine layer influence or an approaching weather front.
