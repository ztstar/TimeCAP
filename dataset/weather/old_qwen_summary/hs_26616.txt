Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal temperature drop, followed by a pronounced daytime warming trend, indicating the influence of diurnal heating cycles. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind direction occurred in the early morning, transitioning from southeasterly to northerly, suggesting a changing air mass or the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before increasing substantially during the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring drier and clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased during the day, particularly in the afternoon, which could enhance mixing in the boundary layer and aid in the dispersion of moisture and pollutants.
