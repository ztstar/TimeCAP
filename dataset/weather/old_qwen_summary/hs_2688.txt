Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation at multiple points, indicating prolonged periods of high moisture and potential for fog or mist. Air pressure showed a clear rise during the early morning hours, peaking before gradually declining, suggesting a passing high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with near-zero values indicating calm conditions, but increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, possibly signaling a shift in air mass. The change in wind direction—from southerly to easterly and then to northerly—hints at a possible influence from a frontal boundary, which could precede changing weather conditions.
