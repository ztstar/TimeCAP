Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a dense, muggy atmosphere and potential for fog or reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, suggesting dynamic atmospheric changes, possibly linked to a passing front or local convection. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly sectors, coupled with falling temperatures and rising pressure, points to a transition toward drier and more stable weather, likely reducing the risk of precipitation in the near term.
