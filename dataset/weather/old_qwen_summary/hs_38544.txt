Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining through the day, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by daytime drying. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which typically signals the approach or presence of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing through the midday hours before picking up again in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, indicating changing circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from humid, stable overnight conditions to a drier, more variable daytime regime, likely driven by a high-pressure ridge influencing the region.
