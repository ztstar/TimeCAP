Over the past 24 hours, a steady temperature rise was observed, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the morning and afternoon hours. Humidity levels climbed significantly in the early evening, peaking near the end of the period, suggesting increasing moisture content in the air, which may contribute to fog or precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline, especially in the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speed increased steadily through the day, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, consistent with storm development. These combined trends point to the likelihood of deteriorating weather conditions, including possible rain or storms, in the near term across New York City.
