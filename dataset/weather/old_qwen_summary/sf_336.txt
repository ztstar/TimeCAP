Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked at near saturation in the overnight and early morning periods, indicating strong fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought moist air and unstable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to marine layer dynamics. The return to calmer winds and a rise in pressure by late afternoon signals the beginning of a more stable, clearing phase, potentially leading to improved visibility and brighter conditions.
