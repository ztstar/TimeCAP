Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, reflecting stable atmospheric conditions and the influence of a persistent high-pressure system over the region. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable reduction during the late night and early morning, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, particularly from the west and south-southeast sectors, which may have contributed to the dispersion of moisture. These patterns collectively point to a clear, dry afternoon following a foggy and damp overnight period, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
