Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a significant cooling trend followed by a modest recovery. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and rose sharply in the mid-afternoon, suggesting increased moisture availability, which may contribute to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the afternoon, peaking sharply before declining slightly, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, consistent with the approach of a cold front or the onset of a more dynamic weather pattern. Overall, the data indicates a transition from a stable, cool, and humid environment to a more variable and potentially unsettled period, with the potential for changing conditions later in the day.
