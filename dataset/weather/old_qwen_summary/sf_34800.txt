Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, starting high and plummeting during midday before rebounding in the evening, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the cooling and drying trend. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with a developing sea breeze or pressure gradient shift. The combination of falling temperatures, erratic wind patterns, and fluctuating humidity suggests a dynamic boundary layer, potentially signaling the approach of a change in weather regime, possibly bringing clearer skies or shifting conditions later in the day.
