Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a sharp rise in the early morning hours, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by fog dissipation and solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking during the darkest hours, which supports the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the overnight period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to onshore patterns, suggesting the influence of a coastal wind surge. Air pressure dropped significantly during the night and early morning, then rebounded, signaling the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system that may have brought the fog and wind. These conditions together point to a classic marine layer event typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for lingering fog and cool temperatures into the early afternoon.
