Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight period, remaining consistently high through the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained stable for most of the day, with a slight increase observed in the mid-afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift toward more consistent northerly and westerly winds in the later hours, suggesting a strengthening marine layer. These conditions point to typical coastal fog and cool temperatures characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly in the morning, with a potential for clearer, more stable weather as the day progresses.
