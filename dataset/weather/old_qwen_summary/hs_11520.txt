Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and changing air mass dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning hours before sharply dropping in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air, possibly associated with a passing frontal boundary. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly, which is characteristic of an approaching low-pressure system or storm development. Wind patterns showed a shift in direction and increased speed during the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west, indicating a change in the prevailing flow that may contribute to instability and potential convective activity. These combined trends suggest a developing weather pattern that could lead to thunderstorm potential later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate near the surface.
