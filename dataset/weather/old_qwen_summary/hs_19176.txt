Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, suggesting moist air masses were present and likely contributed to elevated dew points. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the latter part of the day, especially during the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approaching influence of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from northeasterly to southerly directions, potentially facilitating the transport of warm, moist air into the region. These combined factors—stable high humidity, weakening pressure, and increasing southerly winds—hint at a heightened risk for isolated thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
