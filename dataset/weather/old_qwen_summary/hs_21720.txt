Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before showing a slight recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 97% during the early morning, indicating a saturated atmosphere that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure exhibited a gradual upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest the approach of a stable, drier air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
