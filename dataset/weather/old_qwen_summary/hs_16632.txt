A steady cooling trend was observed overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating the potential for fog or low visibility in the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure showed a continuous increase throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from easterly to southerly during the night, suggesting changing airflow patterns possibly linked to the advancing high pressure. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and diminishing winds points to a likely transition toward more settled conditions with reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
