Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar insolation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests nocturnal condensation and possible fog formation, likely contributing to a damp and oppressive feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal systems, but a slight drop in the late evening may hint at a weak low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, potentially indicating the onset of a diurnal breeze or a shift in regional airflow. The consistent wind direction from the southeast during the morning and a shift toward the west and northwest in the evening suggests a change in circulation patterns, possibly linked to a developing sea breeze or upper-level disturbance.
