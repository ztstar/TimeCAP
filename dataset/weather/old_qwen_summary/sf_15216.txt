Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, indicating the dissipation of marine fog and a return to drier conditions. Air pressure remained elevated through much of the night and morning, suggesting stable high-pressure influence, but dropped sharply in the mid-afternoon, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the period, with a consistent southwest to west wind direction, reinforcing the presence of coastal flow typical of the region’s microclimate. These patterns point to a transition from a foggy, stable coastal regime to a drier, more variable air mass, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and increasing daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
