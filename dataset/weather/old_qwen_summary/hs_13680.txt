Temperature gradually declined overnight, reaching a low before rising steadily through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity remained elevated during the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, then dropped significantly during the day, suggesting clearing skies and daytime drying. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system likely influencing stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, possibly indicating a change in air mass or circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from humid, stable nighttime conditions to a drier, more variable afternoon, with potential for improving visibility and reduced cloud cover.
