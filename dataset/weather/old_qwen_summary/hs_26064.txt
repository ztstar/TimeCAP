Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a noticeable drop in perceived temperature. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late evening, peaking before a sudden decline, which may signal the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric stability. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to easterly directions, with increased speeds in the late afternoon, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system. These combined factors suggest the onset of unstable weather conditions, with potential for thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term.
