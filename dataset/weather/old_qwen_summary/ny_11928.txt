Temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing during the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early hours, then decreased through the day, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that has begun to dissipate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds exhibited moderate variability, with a brief surge in the early morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic air movement across the region. Taken together, these trends point to a transition from a cool, humid, and slightly unsettled night toward a clearer, more stable, and gradually warming daytime, consistent with the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
