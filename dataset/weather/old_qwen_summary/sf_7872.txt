Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of high humidity, with near saturation levels prevailing through the early and late hours, indicating significant moisture in the air. Temperatures showed a gradual decline during the night and early morning, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon, suggesting a diurnal pattern typical of coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, hinting at the influence of a high-pressure system that may be stabilizing conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief period of calm in the early morning, while wind directions shifted from southwest to more southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns possibly linked to local topography and marine layer dynamics. These conditions together suggest the presence of a persistent marine layer, contributing to cool, foggy mornings and a gradual clearing trend in the afternoon, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate.
