Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase followed by early diurnal warming. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the night, then increased significantly in the early morning hours, hinting at possible moisture convergence or fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, consistent with inflow from coastal or maritime sources. These combined patterns suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to overcast skies or precipitation later in the day.
