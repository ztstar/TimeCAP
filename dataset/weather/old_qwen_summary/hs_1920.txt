Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained high through the early part of the period, sharply declining in the late night and early morning, indicating a drying trend likely associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased over the same period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably during the early morning hours, with sustained strong winds from a westerly to northwesterly direction, which may have contributed to the mixing and drying of the lower atmosphere. These combined factors point to the arrival of a dry, stable air mass, potentially signaling the end of a period of high humidity and increased storm risk, with conditions now trending toward clearer skies and more settled weather.
