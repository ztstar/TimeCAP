Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery throughout the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling event likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning, then rose sharply in the late night and early morning before declining again, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture front or localized convection. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, peaking in the early afternoon, which points to the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds and directions showed a notable shift in the early morning, with winds increasing in strength and changing from northeasterly to southerly, consistent with a developing boundary layer adjustment and potential synoptic-scale influence. These combined trends imply a transition from a stable, dry nocturnal regime to a more dynamic, warming daytime pattern, with implications for air quality and potential for afternoon thunderstorms if moisture returns.
