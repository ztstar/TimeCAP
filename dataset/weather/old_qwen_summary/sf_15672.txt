Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting the absence of strong frontal systems, but slight variations may reflect localized sea-breeze effects. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning hours, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with onshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and then back to the west in the final hours suggests changing airflow patterns, potentially signaling the approach of a new air mass or the influence of topographic channeling through the city’s corridors.
