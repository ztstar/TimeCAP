Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in the early morning. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating but generally high values, peaking in the late evening, indicating stable atmospheric conditions that may have suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief surge earlier in the day, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to predominantly from the northwest and west, suggesting the influence of coastal dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a typical marine layer scenario, where cool, moist air pools near the surface, especially in the early morning, with clearing likely as the day progresses and the marine layer lifts.
