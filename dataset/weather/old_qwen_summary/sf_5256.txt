Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before rising gradually in the afternoon, which is typical of coastal marine layer behavior. A notable wind shift occurred in the late morning and afternoon, with sustained easterly to southerly winds bringing moist air inland, likely contributing to the foggy conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent pattern with slight increases in the afternoon, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and limited storm development. The combination of cool temperatures, high humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, which typically results in cool, foggy mornings and clearer, but still mild, afternoons in the region.
