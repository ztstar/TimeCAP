Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 90% in the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited a dynamic pattern, with a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sustained increase, suggesting a shift from a low-pressure system to a more stable high-pressure regime. Wind activity was generally light and variable, with calm periods during the night and a slight intensification in the late evening, primarily from the west to southwest sectors. These conditions collectively indicate a transition from foggy, cool, and damp conditions to clearer, drier, and slightly warmer weather in the coming hours.
