Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, with near-saturation conditions in the early hours that sharply decreased mid-morning, indicating a significant drying event likely tied to a change in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but dropped noticeably during the late evening and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwestern to northeastern, pointing to the influence of a developing or passing weather front. These combined patterns suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier, and potentially breezier weather, which may impact visibility and outdoor activities in the region.
