Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in thermal dynamics likely tied to changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the overnight hours, which suggests the presence of stable, moist air near the surface—typical of marine layer development. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable period of calm conditions in the early morning, though wind direction shifted significantly, indicating changing flow patterns possibly related to local topography and synoptic influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy marine layer environment toward a drier, more stable, and potentially clearer afternoon, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather patterns.
