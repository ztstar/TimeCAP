Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level before slightly declining in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases during midday and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest local circulation changes, possibly linked to urban heat patterns or minor synoptic influences. Overall, the data point to a stable, humid atmosphere with mild temperatures and minimal wind, typical of a quiet, settled period before potential afternoon convection develops.
