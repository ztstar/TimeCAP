Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a slow recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night and into the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, indicating increasing moisture content in the air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds declined in the latter half of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more northerly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns point to a transition toward more stable, humid, and potentially overcast conditions as the high-pressure system continues to build, with limited chances of precipitation but increased comfort levels during the day.
