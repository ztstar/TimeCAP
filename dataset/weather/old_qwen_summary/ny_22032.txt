Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping only slightly in the late afternoon before rebounding in the evening. Air pressure showed a consistent rise during the night, stabilizing at a high level in the early morning and maintaining elevated pressure through the day, indicating stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, peaking in the late evening with sustained strong winds from the northeast quadrant, suggesting a strengthening surface-level pressure gradient. These conditions point to a cold, dry air mass moving in from the northeast, likely associated with a high-pressure system that has brought clear skies and cooler temperatures, potentially leading to frost risk during the night.
