Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of significant frontal activity, consistent with a stable high-pressure regime over the area. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with gusts from the west to southwest, reinforcing the onshore flow that supports coastal fog formation. The shift in wind direction toward the northwest and west in the late afternoon may signal a weakening of the marine layer and a potential clearing trend, offering a window for improved visibility and sunshine later in the day.
