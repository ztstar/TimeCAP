Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced fluctuation, peaking in the early hours and again later in the day, with a sharp decline midday likely indicating a brief dryout period. Air pressure exhibited a significant rise during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which may have contributed to clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with sustained strong winds from the west-southwest, consistent with marine layer dynamics and coastal influence. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then back toward the west suggests a complex interaction of regional airflow patterns, potentially signaling a transition in weather conditions.
