Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels steadily increased during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a consistent rise during the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clear and stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing during the afternoon, with wind directions shifting from westerly to southerly before reversing to northerly late in the period, indicating changing airflow patterns. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier afternoon, consistent with the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that has suppressed precipitation and maintained mostly clear skies.
