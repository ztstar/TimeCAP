Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the day, indicating a cold front passage overnight. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, peaking in the late morning before slightly declining, which suggests increasing moisture availability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline starting in the afternoon, reaching its lowest point in the evening, consistent with an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speed remained constant throughout the period, while wind direction consistently came from the southwest, reinforcing the presence of a steady flow associated with the developing disturbance. Together, these trends point to a transition toward unsettled weather, with potential for precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
