Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a strong diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at extreme levels before dropping significantly in the afternoon, indicating the passage of a marine layer that likely brought fog and low clouds. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike during the late morning and early evening, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night and early morning, with a shift to more consistent easterly and southeasterly flow in the afternoon, consistent with onshore breezes typical of the region’s microclimate. The combination of high humidity, dropping pressure, and persistent wind direction changes suggests the potential for fog formation and cool, damp conditions in the coming hours, particularly near the coast.
