Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier air. Air pressure showed a gradual decline overnight, followed by a rebound in the afternoon, suggesting a passing weather system that may have brought brief instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a marine influence or wind event. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and southerly sectors indicates a change in air mass, likely associated with coastal dynamics and the movement of a frontal system.
