Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, indicating dense fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong onshore winds from the northwest and east during the night, transitioning to more variable and weaker flows in the afternoon. These conditions point to a dynamic coastal influence, with marine layer persistence and possible fog development, typical of San Francisco's microclimate, particularly during transitional periods.
