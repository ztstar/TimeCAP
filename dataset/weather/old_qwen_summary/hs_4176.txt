Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the cooler range. High humidity levels persisted through the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility during the overnight period. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating the passage of a frontal system. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, diminishing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward drier and more stable weather, with potential for improved air quality and reduced heat stress.
