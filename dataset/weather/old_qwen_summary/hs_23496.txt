Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before decreasing during the day, indicating a transition from a more stable to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief reduction during the night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly and then to a more westerly quadrant, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
