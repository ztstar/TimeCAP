Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, indicating strong moisture buildup that likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, signaling changing airflow patterns typical of a developing frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to a dynamic atmospheric transition that could lead to scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
