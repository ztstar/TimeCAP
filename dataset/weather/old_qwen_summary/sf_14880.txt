Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating a period of fog formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief increases correlated to shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly, hinting at changing local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal weather cycle, with marine layer development overnight and clearing during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
