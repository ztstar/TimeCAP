Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the coastal climate. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect by suppressing daytime heating. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly from mid-morning onward, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight, especially between midnight and dawn, with near-zero values at times, reflecting the weakening of coastal winds under the influence of the developing high pressure. Wind direction shifted dramatically from a northerly to a southerly flow in the afternoon, potentially indicating a change in the marine layer dynamics or the onset of a local breeze pattern, which could influence fog dissipation and temperature recovery.
