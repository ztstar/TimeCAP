Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, and then declined sharply during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a pattern of slight fluctuations, with a notable rise during the early morning hours, which may signal the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, contributing to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally light through the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with wind directions shifting from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. Collectively, these indicators suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and stable overnight environment to a drier, more variable, and potentially clearer daytime atmosphere, with favorable conditions for improved visibility and mild temperatures.
