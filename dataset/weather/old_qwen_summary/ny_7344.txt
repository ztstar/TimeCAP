Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping dramatically during midday, only to rise again in the late afternoon, indicating a possible frontal passage. A notable increase in air pressure during the midday hours suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with a change in air mass. These indicators collectively point to a transition from a moist, cooler air mass to a drier, more stable one, likely resulting in improving weather conditions in the near term.
