Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and peaked in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests a shift from stable, moist conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a sharp spike followed by a sustained drop, hinting at the passage of a weather front that may have brought brief precipitation and changing wind patterns. Wind speeds remained generally low, with intermittent increases likely tied to shifting airflow associated with the pressure changes, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. The wind direction transitioned from northerly and westerly in the early hours to easterly and southerly later in the day, indicating a change in circulation that could signal the approach of a new air mass, potentially influencing future storm development.
