Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with high values during the night and early morning, sharply decreasing in the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting moisture influx and subsequent drying. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking during the late morning, then fluctuating, which is consistent with the passage of a high-pressure system that brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, increasing notably in the late evening and overnight, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass dynamics, likely linked to frontal activity. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cold, moist, and stable environment to a drier, cooler, and increasingly windy regime, with potential for clear skies and crisp conditions in the coming hours.
