Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before gradually declining, suggesting moisture accumulation during cooler nighttime conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight drop in the late evening, which may indicate the approach of a weak disturbance or shifting air mass. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, decreasing notably in the mid-afternoon before increasing again in the evening, with shifts in wind direction reflecting changing airflow patterns, particularly from southerly to easterly sectors. These combined trends suggest the potential for developing thunderstorm activity later in the day, especially if instability continues to build with warming and high moisture levels persisting.
