Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, indicating persistent marine influence, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon as onshore winds subsided. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the night, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest, likely driven by a strengthening sea breeze and possibly a developing coastal trough. The shift in wind direction toward the northwest and west in the final hours reflects a dynamic change in the local wind pattern, which could signal an approaching frontal boundary or a shift in synoptic-scale flow.
