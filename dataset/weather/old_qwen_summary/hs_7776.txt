Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to westerly and southwesterly, hinting at a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure system’s circulation. These conditions point to a dry, stable, and warm environment in the late afternoon and evening, which may increase the risk of elevated fire weather if dry conditions persist.
