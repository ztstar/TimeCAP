Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure remained elevated through the night, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions, before a slight drop in the afternoon, possibly indicating the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift from southerly to westerly and then southerly directions, consistent with coastal influences and katabatic flows. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and persistent wind patterns indicates a high likelihood of foggy conditions persisting into the next morning, especially in low-lying and coastal areas.
