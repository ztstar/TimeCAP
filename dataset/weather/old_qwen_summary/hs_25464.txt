Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a warming day. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to the cooling and moisture-laden air. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief increase in the late evening, which may have contributed to the mixing of air layers and a slight reduction in humidity. Overall, the data reflects a stable, drying trend following a period of high moisture and cooling, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day.
