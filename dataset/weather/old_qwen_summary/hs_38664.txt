Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a consistent cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained high during the overnight hours, dropping significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of drier air, likely due to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds rose notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly sectors, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that may precede a weather front. Collectively, these trends suggest the end of a humid, potentially stormy period and the onset of drier, more stable conditions, which could reduce the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
