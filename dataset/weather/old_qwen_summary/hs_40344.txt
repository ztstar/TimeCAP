Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more convective air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable drop in the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a warm, moist air inflow typical of pre-storm conditions. These combined trends point to a heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate under a weakening upper-level ridge.
