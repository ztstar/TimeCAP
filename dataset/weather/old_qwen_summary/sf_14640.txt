Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A significant increase in wind speed occurred during the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of a coastal upwelling pattern. The air pressure exhibited a brief spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a steady decline, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or approaching weather disturbance. These conditions collectively point to typical marine layer dynamics, with strong coastal influences and potential for foggy mornings transitioning into clearer, breezier afternoons.
