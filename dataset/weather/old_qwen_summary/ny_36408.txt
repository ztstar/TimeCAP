Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling phase followed by a warming trend. Humidity remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cool feel despite the daytime temperature rise. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning, signaling improving weather conditions and the possible approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon hours, with gusts from the northeast and east, potentially bringing in cooler air and enhancing the feeling of chill. The shift in wind direction from northwesterly to easterly and southeasterly suggests a change in air mass, possibly linked to a weather front passing through, which could lead to clearer skies and more stable conditions by evening.
