Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours and remained near saturation, suggesting dense fog formation and persistence, consistent with typical San Francisco maritime conditions. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, hinting at a potential shift in atmospheric stability, possibly signaling the approach of a changing weather pattern. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that likely contributed to the transport of cool, moist air from the Pacific Ocean. These conditions collectively point to a marine layer-dominated environment, typical of the region, with implications for visibility, temperature stability, and potential for foggy conditions into the coming hours.
