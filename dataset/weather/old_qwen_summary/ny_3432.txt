Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖, indicating a cold night with a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, remaining generally moderate to high during the night and early morning, then dropping sharply during the afternoon before rising again in the evening—suggesting possible clearing skies and re-moistening. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking toward the end, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early and late hours, with notable gusts from the northwest and west sectors, while wind direction remained consistently from the northwesterly quadrant, pointing to a persistent cold air flow. These combined patterns suggest a cold front has passed through, leaving behind cooler, drier, and more stable air, which is likely to result in clear skies and a continued cold but relatively calm day.
