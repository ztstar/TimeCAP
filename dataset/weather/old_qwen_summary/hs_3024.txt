Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature increase during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming phase. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely tied to overnight condensation or low-level moisture influx. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by sustained low pressure through the evening, which is indicative of an approaching weather system, possibly a storm or frontal passage. Wind speeds intensified toward the end of the period, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, suggesting dynamic airflow changes consistent with a developing disturbance. These combined patterns point to an unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
