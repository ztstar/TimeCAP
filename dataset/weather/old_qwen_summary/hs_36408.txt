Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the cooler hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, particularly from the southeast, aligning with typical patterns preceding thunderstorms in the region. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and sustained high humidity implies a heightened risk of thunderstorm development later in the day, especially as temperatures rise and instability increases.
