Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the midday hours before rebounding in the evening, indicating a shift in air mass or possible fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a significant spike in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts and variable directions, including a marked shift from prevailing southwest to more variable and sometimes northerly flow, which may have influenced coastal fog patterns. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cool, moist, and fog-prone environment to a drier and more stable atmosphere, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
