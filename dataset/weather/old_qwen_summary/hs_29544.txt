Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west to northwest, suggesting the influence of a developing weather front. The shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast in the final hours implies a potential change in air mass, possibly heralding a transition to more unsettled conditions, including the threat of thunderstorms.
