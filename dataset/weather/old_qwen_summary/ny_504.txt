Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and into the evening, indicating a shift toward more moderate conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting a possible influx of moist air that may have contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, then stabilized before a slight drop in the late afternoon, hinting at the passage of a high-pressure system with potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with variable directions indicating shifting air currents, possibly linked to a developing frontal boundary. These patterns collectively suggest a transition period in the weather, with increasing stability and improving conditions likely leading to clearer skies in the coming hours.
