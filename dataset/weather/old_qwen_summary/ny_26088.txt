Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation before dropping sharply, suggesting a period of condensation or precipitation followed by drying conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable increase in the early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition from cooler, moist conditions to warmer, drier air under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely resulting in improved weather and reduced chance of precipitation.
