Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential development of convective activity. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a decline, suggesting moisture accumulation consistent with potential for thunderstorm development. Air pressure showed a steady decrease, especially in the late evening and overnight, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or low-pressure troughs. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, indicating changing air flow patterns that may support storm organization. These combined trends point to a heightened risk of afternoon and evening thunderstorms, with the potential for gusty winds and localized heavy rainfall.
