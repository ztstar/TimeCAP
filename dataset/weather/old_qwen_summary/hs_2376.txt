Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating increasing solar heating and a transition toward more stable daytime conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning and late evening, suggesting saturated air and potential for fog or low clouds, especially overnight. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the night and early morning, followed by a slight rebound, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with a developing onshore flow that often precedes thunderstorm activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing winds points to a high likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the coming hours.
