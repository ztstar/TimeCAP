Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool, stable conditions to a period of increasing thermal energy. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before rapidly declining in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a marine layer that dissipated as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the night and early morning, with a slight increase in the afternoon and a minor drop toward evening, hinting at subtle atmospheric adjustments possibly linked to shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, then diminished to near calm conditions during the midday, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast in the evening, indicating a change in local circulation. These patterns collectively point to the dissipation of a coastal fog layer and a transition toward clearer, warmer conditions later in the day, which may influence visibility, outdoor activities, and local microclimates.
