Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture in the air and potential for fog formation. Air pressure remained stable with a slight upward trend during the night, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clear, calm conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low, especially during the late night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from a southwest to a southerly and later a northeasterly flow, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These conditions point to a typical coastal marine layer pattern, with fog and cool temperatures likely persisting into the morning hours.
