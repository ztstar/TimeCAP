Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cooler night phase into warmer daytime conditions. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, likely contributing to a damp and muggy feel. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly, signaling the approach of a weather system. The sustained rise in wind speed, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, points to the influence of a developing low-pressure system or storm front moving into the region. These combined indicators suggest a high likelihood of precipitation in the near term, with potential for thunderstorms, especially during the overnight and early morning hours.
