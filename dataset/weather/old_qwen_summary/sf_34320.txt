Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning hours and steadily declining through the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure rose significantly in the afternoon, peaking sharply before dropping again, indicating a passing weather system that brought transient stability followed by returning instability. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and late evening, with gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal airflow patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics. The shift in wind direction from southwest to west and then to northwest suggests the influence of a changing pressure gradient, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass that could bring clearer skies later today.
