Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s marine layer behavior. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations that did not signal an approaching storm system, indicating a stable atmospheric regime. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, which is characteristic of the onshore flow that often brings in fog and cooler air. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and weak, northerly winds points to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to foggy conditions in the early morning and cool, damp weather across the region.
