Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of marine layer conditions commonly associated with fog formation. A significant drop in humidity occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a rise in temperature and wind activity, signaling a possible break in the marine layer and clearing of fog. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the morning and early afternoon, followed by a sharp decline in the late evening, which may indicate the approach of a weather system or front. Wind patterns were variable but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in direction suggesting changes in atmospheric circulation, possibly linked to synoptic-scale weather developments.
