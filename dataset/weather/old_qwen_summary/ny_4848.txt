Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds as moisture accumulated near the surface. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early to mid-part of the night, diminishing by late morning and remaining light in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and increasing humidity late in the cycle suggests that skies may begin to cloud over, with possible light precipitation or drizzle developing later in the day.
