Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming during the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal marine climates. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, likely due to marine layer formation, before dropping significantly during the day as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary that brought in moist, cooler air. Wind speeds surged during the overnight hours, particularly from the west-southwest, consistent with onshore flow associated with the marine layer, before subsiding to light and variable conditions during the day. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then back to westerly supports the influence of local topography and sea breeze dynamics, with potential implications for fog development and coastal visibility.
