Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog formation or low-lying stratus clouds, typical of coastal conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around dawn, followed by a slow recovery, indicating a passing weather system or low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, with stronger, more consistent winds coming from a northerly to westerly direction, likely driven by marine layer dynamics. These combined factors point to a classic coastal marine weather pattern, with potential for foggy conditions and cool, damp mornings, especially in low-lying and coastal areas.
