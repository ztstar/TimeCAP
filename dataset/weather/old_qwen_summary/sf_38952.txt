Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to a milder day. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, with high values in the early hours and a sharp drop during midday, suggesting a shift in air mass or the influence of coastal fog dissipation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaked in the late morning, then declined sharply in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the midday and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, pointing to a change in atmospheric circulation likely linked to a frontal passage. These combined trends suggest the influence of a maritime air mass shift, potentially leading to overcast skies and a higher chance of light precipitation later in the day.
