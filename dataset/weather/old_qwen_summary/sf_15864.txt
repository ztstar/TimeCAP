Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising during the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before dropping slightly during the midday hours, suggesting a possible shift in moisture content. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, indicating a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon, with strong gusts recorded in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest the influence of a developing coastal wind event, potentially bringing cooler, more variable conditions and increased chances of fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
