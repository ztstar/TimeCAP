Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during midday, followed by a steady decline into the night, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, reflecting increased moisture content, which likely contributed to a more oppressive feel during the night and early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement across the area. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northeasterly and then to easterly, indicating a change in surface airflow possibly linked to local thermal patterns. The combination of high humidity, moderate temperatures, and light, shifting winds suggests a stable, muggy atmosphere with minimal potential for convective activity.
