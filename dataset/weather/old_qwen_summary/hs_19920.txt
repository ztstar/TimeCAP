Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and showing a slight decline during midday, which may suggest diminishing moisture content as the day warmed. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the 18th to the 24th hour, signaling a possible approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and remained elevated, accompanied by a steady shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, which is typical of developing convective activity. These combined factors—rising temperatures, weakening pressure, sustained winds, and high humidity—suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development or increased precipitation risk in the coming hours.
