Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then sharply decreased during the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air, possibly due to a change in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then more southerly by late evening, consistent with dynamic changes in atmospheric circulation. Overall, the data point to improving weather conditions, with decreasing humidity and rising pressure likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures in the coming hours.
