Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-night, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and westerly flows to more variable and stronger southeasterly and easterly directions, which may have contributed to the influx of moist air. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially foggy conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
