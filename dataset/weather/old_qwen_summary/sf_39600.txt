Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise during midday, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from the west to the north and then northeast, reflecting changing synoptic patterns and possible upslope flow. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, cool marine layer to a clearer, warmer, and more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
