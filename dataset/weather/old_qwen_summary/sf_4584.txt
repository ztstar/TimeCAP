Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high in the early morning and late night, suggesting fog formation, while a sharp drop in humidity during midday coincided with increased solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and early afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system, but then declined sharply in the late evening, signaling a potential change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and late evening, with consistent prevailing winds from the west and northwest, which likely contributed to coastal cooling and fog advection. The sudden drop in pressure and increase in wind speed toward the end of the period suggest the possible arrival of a low-pressure system, which could bring unsettled weather, including the potential for rain or stronger winds in the coming hours.
