Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were elevated during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before sharply declining as temperatures rose, indicating a transition from moist marine influence to drier inland conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations that suggest a weak, non-disturbed atmospheric regime. Wind activity showed intermittent bursts, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon, with variable directions suggesting shifting local wind patterns influenced by topography and sea-breeze dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a more dynamic weather phase, potentially bringing stronger onshore flow or a change in air mass.
