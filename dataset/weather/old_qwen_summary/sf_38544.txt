Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking in the early morning and late night, suggesting periods of fog or low cloud cover, which are typical for the region’s microclimate. A sharp rise in air pressure occurred in the middle of the night, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by shifts in wind direction from offshore to onshore and across multiple quadrants, consistent with coastal wind dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cooler, foggy, and humid night to a progressively drier and windier daytime, reflecting the influence of both marine layer behavior and regional synoptic patterns.
