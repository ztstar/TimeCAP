Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler, stable period to a warming phase. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest in the late evening point to the arrival of a passing frontal system, likely responsible for the atmospheric instability. Air pressure showed a marked decline in the latter half of the period, reinforcing the influence of a low-pressure system moving through the region. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather pattern with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms, particularly during the evening and overnight hours.
