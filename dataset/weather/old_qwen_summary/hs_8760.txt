Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of changing air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, indicating the approach and arrival of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to southeasterly, reflecting the reorganization of circulation around the high-pressure ridge. This combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds suggests a transition toward muggy but mostly calm weather, with potential for localized showers later in the day if moisture continues to accumulate.
