Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early morning. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, associated with stable and generally clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to easterly and then northwesterly, suggesting changing flow patterns aloft. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing temperatures toward the end of the period suggests improving conditions with reduced risk of precipitation and a transition toward more settled weather.
