Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels surged dramatically after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely contributing to a noticeable damp feeling in the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the evening and into the late night, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, but picked up in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, potentially indicating changing circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward drier and more stable air, with a reduced risk of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
