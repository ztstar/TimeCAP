Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a persistent layer of high humidity, with near-saturated conditions dominating much of the period, particularly during early morning and late evening hours, indicating strong moisture presence. Temperatures remained consistently cool, with minimal fluctuation, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions influenced by marine air intrusion. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, hinting at a possible approaching weather system, though the overall pattern remained relatively stable. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with variability in direction indicating shifting local wind patterns, possibly due to coastal topography and sea breeze dynamics. These conditions together suggest a likelihood of fog or overcast skies, with little chance of significant precipitation, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
