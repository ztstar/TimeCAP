Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day and into the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting potential for unstable air conditions. Air pressure steadily declined, reaching a low point in the final hours, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system and possible precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during midday and late evening, with consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, contributing to a warm, moist air advection that enhances the risk of thunderstorms. The combination of rising temperature, high humidity, falling pressure, and strong, sustained winds points to an elevated potential for severe weather, particularly during the overnight period.
