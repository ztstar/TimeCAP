Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a shift from a cooler nighttime period into a warming daytime phase. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with elevated readings during early morning and overnight hours, suggesting increased moisture availability that may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable rise during midday, peaking before declining slightly, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system influencing stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with only brief periods of increased gustiness, and wind direction exhibited variability, including a shift toward more southerly and easterly components in the afternoon, potentially indicating changing air mass influences. Collectively, these patterns suggest a transition toward more stable, humid conditions, which could increase the likelihood of afternoon showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
