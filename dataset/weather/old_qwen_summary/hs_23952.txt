Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to warmer conditions. Humidity levels spiked to near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel. Air pressure remained relatively high throughout the period, with a brief decline in the late afternoon, hinting at subtle atmospheric changes but no major storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns, potentially reflecting changing surface influences or a weakening front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds in the evening suggests the onset of a drier, more stable air mass, possibly signaling a shift toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions.
