Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping sharply in the midday hours before rising again in the late evening, indicating a shift in air mass and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon and early evening, reaching a low point before rebounding, suggesting the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night and early morning, with sustained strong winds from the southwest and later shifting to the southeast and south, contributing to the cooling and mixing of the boundary layer. These dynamics point to a transition period influenced by a coastal wind shift and possibly a low-pressure system, which may lead to variable conditions, including fog or drizzle, later in the day.
