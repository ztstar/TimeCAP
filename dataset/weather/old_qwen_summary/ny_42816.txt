Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity spiked to saturation levels during the early hours, suggesting potential fog formation or light precipitation, which later subsided as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight rise followed by a gradual decline, reflecting a stable high-pressure system with minimal disturbance. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwest to southerly, hinting at a possible change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist night to a milder, drier morning, with conditions favorable for clearing skies and improving visibility.
