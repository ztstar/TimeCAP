Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling effect likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, common in coastal areas during cooler periods. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the early morning hours, pointing to the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring prolonged overcast conditions or light precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, with a shift toward more persistent and stronger southerly to westerly flow, indicating the onset of a more dynamic atmospheric regime. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a cooler, more humid, and potentially unsettled weather pattern, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
