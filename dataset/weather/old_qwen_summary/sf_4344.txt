Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning hours before dropping steadily through the night and into the early afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching saturation multiple times during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog and low cloud cover, which are common in the region's marine layer. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, particularly from a southerly to westerly direction, contributing to the mixing of air and the gradual dissipation of the marine layer. The combination of these factors points to a typical coastal weather pattern characterized by a strong nocturnal cooling phase, fog development, and a daytime transition driven by increasing solar heating and wind activity.
