Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, creating saturated conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, while a sharp decline in moisture occurred during the midday hours. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a pronounced rise during the early morning and late evening, suggesting the influence of passing weather systems, possibly a front or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong surge observed in the final hours, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions—indicating potential onshore flow. These combined trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, with conditions conducive to unstable air and the potential for thunderstorms, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate during the day.
