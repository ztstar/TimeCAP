Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, indicating a shift from stable nighttime conditions to a drier, warmer daytime regime. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by a recovery in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to overnight cloudiness and humidity. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day but increased slightly in the late afternoon, coinciding with changes in wind direction that suggest a shift in airflow patterns, possibly linked to the approaching or departing weather system. These combined trends point to a dynamic transition in Houston’s weather, with potential for unstable conditions later in the day, including possible afternoon thunderstorms as warm, moist air masses interact with changing pressure gradients.
