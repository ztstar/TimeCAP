Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the early hours and then sharply dropping, suggesting a shift from saturated to drier air conditions. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwest to more southerly sectors, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a moist, cooler, and unstable period to a drier, more stable, and potentially warmer regime, typical of post-frontal conditions in the region.
