Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a dynamic diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist during the early hours, likely due to temperature dropping near dew point. A significant increase in air pressure, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, reflects the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions at dawn, followed by a notable increase in the late afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially indicating the influence of a developing boundary or frontal passage. The combination of rising pressure, clearing skies, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable and drier weather in the near term, with reduced chances of precipitation.
