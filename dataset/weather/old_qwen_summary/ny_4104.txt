Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, followed by a pronounced drop later in the day, suggesting a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure dropped significantly in the early hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which was later followed by a sharp rebound, likely due to a cold front passing through. Wind activity intensified in the early morning and late afternoon, with gusts originating from the northwest and west, consistent with frontal passage and increasing atmospheric instability. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing the potential for precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
