Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching near saturation by morning, which significantly increased the perceived discomfort and contributed to a muggy atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable weather and precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the latter half of the period, with stronger gusts and a dramatic shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns point to an evolving weather system that could bring thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
