Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before easing slightly during the day, indicating a shift toward more moist air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with only minor fluctuations, while wind direction shifted notably in the late afternoon, suggesting a brief change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a stable, dry-to-moist transition under the influence of a high-pressure ridge, likely contributing to clear skies and mild temperatures.
