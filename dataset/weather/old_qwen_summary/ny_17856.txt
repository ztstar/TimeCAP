Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking during the night before sharply dropping in the late morning, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation followed by clearing skies. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, reaching a low point in the early morning and remaining low, a sign of an approaching or ongoing low-pressure system. Wind speeds fluctuated, with stronger gusts observed in the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction—particularly from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly—indicating dynamic air mass movement. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a frontal system, likely bringing unsettled conditions, potential for light rain or drizzle, and cooler, more variable weather ahead.
