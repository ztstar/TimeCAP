Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and rising solar insolation. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds, which dissipated as temperatures climbed and humidity dropped during the afternoon. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late night and early morning, followed by a steady increase, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south-southwest, consistent with the development of a sea breeze or the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Taken together, these patterns suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight environment to a drier, more dynamic afternoon, with potential for developing thunderstorms if additional moisture and lift are introduced.
