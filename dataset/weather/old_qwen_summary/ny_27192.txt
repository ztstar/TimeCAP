Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity spiked to near saturation during the early morning hours, persisting at high levels through midday, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the persistent cool feel despite the warming trend. Air pressure exhibited a noticeable drop in the late afternoon, followed by a modest rise, pointing to a passing weather system that may have brought precipitation earlier in the day. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief increase in the late evening, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more southeasterly, indicating a change in flow associated with the approaching or departing frontal system. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a stable, moist, and cool regime to a slightly more variable and potentially clearer period, with implications for reduced visibility and a lingering cool, damp atmosphere in the city.
