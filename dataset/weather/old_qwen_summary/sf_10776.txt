Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed significant spikes during early morning and late night, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a peak near midday, potentially signaling a passing weather front or shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief increases in the late afternoon, likely associated with localized sea breeze development. Wind direction changes, particularly the shift from westerly to southerly and northerly components, reflect complex interactions between coastal topography and regional pressure gradients.
