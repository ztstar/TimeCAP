Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a nighttime cooling phase. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation, particularly during the hours of lowest temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a slight increase in the midday hours and a minor drop toward the end, hinting at possible weak atmospheric disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction—particularly from easterly to southerly—indicating a change in air mass movement that may have contributed to the warming trend. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cooler, moist, and stable nocturnal environment to a more dynamic and warming daytime atmosphere, with implications for possible afternoon thunderstorm development if sufficient instability builds.
