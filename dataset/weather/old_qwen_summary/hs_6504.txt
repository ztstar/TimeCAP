Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply as temperatures climbed, indicating a transition from a stable, moist environment to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which then weakened slightly in the late afternoon, potentially allowing for more dynamic weather changes. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow during the night and early morning, shifting to more variable directions in the late afternoon and evening—possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and fluctuating pressure trends suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, particularly if moisture levels begin to rise again.
