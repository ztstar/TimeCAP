Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels spiked dramatically in the overnight period, remaining elevated through the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the influence of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking in the late afternoon, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing more stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the west and northwest, aligning with the frontal passage, before decreasing and shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon. These indicators collectively suggest that Houston has transitioned from a moist, unstable air mass to drier, more stable conditions under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
