Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture and potential for fog or drizzle, which may have contributed to discomfort. A steady decline in atmospheric pressure was observed, culminating in a significant drop toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then northeasterly directions, with increasing speeds in the late evening, potentially signaling the onset of a frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward more active and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
