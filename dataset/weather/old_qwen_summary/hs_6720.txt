Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low during the night, increasing in the afternoon with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south and southeast, consistent with the development of a daytime thermal circulation. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable night to a warmer, more dynamic afternoon, which may increase the risk of isolated afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
