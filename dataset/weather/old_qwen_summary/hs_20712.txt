Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to evening convection or a nearby air mass shift. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the mid-to-late morning, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and persisted through the afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, which may reflect changing synoptic-scale flow. Combined, these indicators point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
