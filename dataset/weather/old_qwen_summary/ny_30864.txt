Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold night transitioning into a milder day. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during the early morning, reflecting the cooling trend, with a notable resurgence in moisture during the late morning and early afternoon, likely due to increased evaporation and atmospheric instability. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning and remaining high through the afternoon, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, particularly from the northwest, and then decreased during midday before increasing again in the evening, suggesting a dynamic shift in local wind patterns. The change in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast in the late afternoon indicates a shift in air mass, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air and influencing the potential for developing weather phenomena later in the day.
