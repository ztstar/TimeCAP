Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply, indicating a transition from a moist marine layer to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that contributed to improved conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with calm periods and variable wind directions, but increased notably in the final hours, particularly from the west-southwest, possibly signaling a shift in local wind patterns. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds late in the period suggests a diminishing marine influence and the potential for clearer skies and more stable weather in the near term.
