Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which indicates a strong likelihood of fog or low-lying clouds, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight increase in the midday period, suggesting a temporary stabilization in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of light to moderate wind, primarily from the southwesterly to southerly sectors, which may have contributed to the transport of moist marine air. Together, these conditions point to a typical coastal marine influence, with persistent fog and cool, damp conditions likely to continue into the next day.
