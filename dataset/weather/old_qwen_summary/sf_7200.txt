Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests persistent fog or low cloud cover, typical of coastal conditions during summer months. Air pressure showed a series of fluctuations, with a significant drop in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system or shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with strong southerly to westerly winds, contributing to the cooling and moisture transport from the Pacific. These combined factors point to a coastal weather pattern dominated by marine influence, with potential for foggy mornings and variable wind conditions continuing into the near term.
