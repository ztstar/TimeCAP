Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, indicating increasing moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with calm conditions prevailing until mid-morning, when a shift in wind direction and increased speed from the northwest signaled the arrival of a new air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and increasing humidity points to a transition toward more settled weather, but with lingering moisture that could support afternoon cloud development or isolated showers.
