Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, which is consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increased moisture and overcast conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively low throughout the night, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, aligning with a maritime influence and potential onshore flow. The recent rise in temperature and decline in humidity in the final hours point to a potential clearing trend, though lingering marine layer effects may still influence visibility and comfort.
