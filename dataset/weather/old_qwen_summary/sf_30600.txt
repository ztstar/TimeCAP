Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying due to increased mixing and wind. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, followed by a recovery, indicating the influence of a transient low-pressure system that may have brought temporary instability. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southerly and easterly components, likely enhancing coastal fog dissipation and promoting air advection. These combined patterns point to a dynamic coastal transition, with maritime influences driving temperature moderation, humidity shifts, and variable wind conditions.
