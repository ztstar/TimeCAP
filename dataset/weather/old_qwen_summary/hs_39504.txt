Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a passing frontal system. Air pressure rose consistently throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for drier conditions. These factors together suggest a transition from a humid, unstable environment to a drier, more stable air mass, reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
