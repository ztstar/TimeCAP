Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and mild conditions. Humidity levels showed a steady decline throughout the day, suggesting decreasing moisture in the atmosphere and a reduced likelihood of fog or precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and fair weather. Wind speeds diminished significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, while wind direction shifted from northwest to more west-southwesterly, consistent with a weakening marine layer. Together, these trends point to a transition from cool, fog-prone conditions to a drier, more stable, and sunnier afternoon and evening.
