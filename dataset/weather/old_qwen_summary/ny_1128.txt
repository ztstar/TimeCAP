Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable until midday, when they sharply increased, indicating potential moisture accumulation in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, suggesting a build-up of high-pressure influence, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon before subsiding during the night, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and eventually westerly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from cooler, dry conditions to a more stable, humid environment, likely culminating in partly cloudy to clear skies by early morning.
