Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a nighttime cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning, then surged to near saturation in the late night and early morning before sharply decreasing during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from moist to dry air masses. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaked in the early morning, and then declined in the late afternoon, signaling a passing high-pressure system followed by the approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds remained low during the early night, increased in the late afternoon and evening, and were strongest in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the end of a cool, dry, stable period and the imminent arrival of a more unstable, potentially stormy weather regime.
