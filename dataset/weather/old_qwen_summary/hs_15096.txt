Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal boundary layer that trapped moisture near the surface. Air pressure showed a sharp increase during the night and early morning, followed by a period of stability and then a slight decline, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and eventually to west-southwest, indicating a change in upper-level flow possibly associated with a developing weather front. These combined patterns suggest the atmosphere was transitioning from a stable, humid nocturnal regime to a more dynamic, mixed boundary layer, increasing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms.
