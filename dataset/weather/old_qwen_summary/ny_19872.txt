Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of a cold front that passed overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A sharp increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that brought stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early hours, particularly from the northwest, before subsiding, with wind direction shifting toward the southwest and then southeast in the afternoon, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and variable winds points to improving weather conditions, with likely clearer skies and a transition to more settled, cooler weather in the coming hours.
