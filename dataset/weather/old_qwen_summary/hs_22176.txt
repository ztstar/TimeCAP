Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation and increased discomfort during cooler periods. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, indicating a change in airflow patterns consistent with a developing high-pressure influence. Together, these trends point to a transition toward more stable and dry conditions, with reduced chances of precipitation, although lingering high humidity may maintain a muggy feel during the day.
