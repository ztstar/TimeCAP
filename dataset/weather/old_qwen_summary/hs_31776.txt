Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass or the influence of localized convection. Air pressure steadily increased, reaching a peak in the late evening before slightly declining, suggesting the passing of a high-pressure system with potential for stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with directional shifts indicating changing wind patterns, possibly tied to a developing low-level circulation. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing instability and potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
