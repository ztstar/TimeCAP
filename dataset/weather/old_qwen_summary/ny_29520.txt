Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually warming into the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop in the mid-morning, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily rose over the 24-hour period, peaking in the late afternoon and indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were strongest in the early hours and late night, with variable direction patterns that suggest dynamic atmospheric conditions, particularly during nocturnal hours. The convergence of increasing pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable wind patterns points to improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies in the coming hours.
