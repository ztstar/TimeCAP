Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, with sharp spikes indicating fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure dropped significantly through the middle of the night before stabilizing and rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning, peaking in the late night and early morning hours, with strong southerly to westerly winds indicating a shift in flow patterns. These conditions point to a coastal influence with marine layer development and a dynamic atmospheric setup, likely contributing to foggy conditions and variable wind gusts across the region.
