Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a buildup of heat. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moist air. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, peaking in the mid-afternoon before slightly decreasing, which may signal an approaching weather shift. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift toward more consistent southerly and easterly directions, potentially bringing in warmer, moist air from the Gulf. Combined, these trends suggest the onset of a hot, humid afternoon with potential for thunderstorm development as instability increases.
