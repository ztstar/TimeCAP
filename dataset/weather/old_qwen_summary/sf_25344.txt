Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a minimum during the early morning hours before gradually rising toward the end of the period. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking in the early morning and midday hours before declining, suggesting a shift from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early and midday hours, followed by a sharp drop in the late evening, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind patterns displayed a shift from strong, variable winds in the early hours to more moderate and consistent flow later, with a notable change in direction toward the northeast in the final hours, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cool, fog-prone period to a drier, slightly warmer phase, possibly setting the stage for clearer conditions later in the day.
