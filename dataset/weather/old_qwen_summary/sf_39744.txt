Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, a common feature in the region during these conditions. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around dawn, when winds weakened and changed direction, transitioning from strong westerly flow to light, variable winds, indicating a possible breakdown in coastal breeze dynamics. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a sharp low just before dawn, suggesting the arrival of a low-pressure system influencing the region. The return of stronger winds in the late afternoon, now from the northeast, hints at a potential change in weather patterns, possibly signaling a shift toward clearer skies or the approach of a new weather front.
