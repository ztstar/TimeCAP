Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a shift from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. A pronounced wind event occurred in the early hours, with strong southwest to west winds that subsided mid-morning before picking up again in the late afternoon, likely driven by a pressure gradient. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, consistent with a steady weather pattern, though a slight drop in the evening may signal an approaching change. The shift in wind direction from west to more southerly and then easterly suggests a possible change in airflow, potentially indicating the influence of a coastal breeze or an approaching weather system.
