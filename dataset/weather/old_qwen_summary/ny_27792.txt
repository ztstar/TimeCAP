Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or mist that likely reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, shifting to lighter winds during midday before strengthening again in the late afternoon, with wind directions transitioning from west to south and then back to west, indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and moderate humidity suggests that conditions are stabilizing, pointing toward improving weather and potentially clearer skies in the near term.
