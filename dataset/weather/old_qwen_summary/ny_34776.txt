Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, indicating a warming trend during daylight hours. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then declined significantly during the day, suggesting a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure steadily rose through the afternoon and evening, reaching a peak before slightly dropping again, which is often associated with the approach or passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased modestly during midday and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then southerly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the influence of a developing high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and improving conditions later in the day.
