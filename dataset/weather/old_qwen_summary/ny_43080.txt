Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, peaking in the early morning hours and then declining sharply through the day, suggesting a drying air mass following a period of moisture buildup. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined factors point to the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, likely resulting in improving visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the coming hours.
