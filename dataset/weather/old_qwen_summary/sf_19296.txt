Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistent high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that contribute to a damp, cool feel. A steady decline in air pressure suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-range before tapering off, with wind direction shifting gradually from southeasterly to southerly, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. The temperature remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend overnight, consistent with nocturnal cooling under cloudy and humid conditions. These combined factors suggest the likelihood of foggy or drizzly conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during such meteorological patterns.
