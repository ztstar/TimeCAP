Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming trend as daytime progressed, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation levels, which likely contributed to a thick, oppressive feel and increased likelihood of fog or drizzle. A gradual drop in air pressure occurred through the afternoon and evening, culminating in a low-pressure system that may signal the approach of unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, with gusts reaching notable levels, accompanied by variable wind directions suggesting a shift in atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, with increased risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
