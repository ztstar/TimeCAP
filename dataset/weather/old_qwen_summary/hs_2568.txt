Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, then sharply declined in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely associated with a shift in air mass or circulation. Air pressure showed a notable decrease overnight, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction implying changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to system movement. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather shift, potentially accompanied by clearing skies and improving conditions, though lingering moisture could prompt localized afternoon showers.
