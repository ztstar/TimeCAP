Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A significant drop in humidity occurred during the night, coinciding with a sharp increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from offshore to more onshore and variable, suggesting a change in air mass. The air pressure fluctuated notably, with a marked decrease during the late night and early morning, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns show strong, gusty conditions in the early hours, followed by calmer and more variable winds later, potentially influencing fog formation and dispersal. These combined dynamics suggest a transitional weather period, with potential for foggy conditions in the morning hours and increasing stability later in the day.
