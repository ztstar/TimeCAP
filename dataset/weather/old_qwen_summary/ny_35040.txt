Over the past 24 hours, a noticeable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming period in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, peaking significantly in the late afternoon, indicating saturated air conditions conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a sharp rise midday, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to more southerly, signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and stable environment to one that may become more settled, with minimal precipitation expected in the immediate future.
