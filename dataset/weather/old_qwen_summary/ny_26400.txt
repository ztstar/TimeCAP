Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture in the early hours, reaching saturation at one point, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a slow recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the northwest and shifting to the south-southeast later, suggesting a developing frontal influence. These combined patterns point to a transition period marked by cooling, high moisture, and shifting wind dynamics, possibly heralding an approaching storm or precipitation event.
