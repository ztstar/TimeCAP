Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking in the early hours and remaining elevated into the early morning, which suggests a moist air mass with limited dispersion. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant system passage but consistent near-surface stability. Wind speeds were moderate and generally consistent, shifting from southeast to south-southwest directions, indicating a stable synoptic pattern with minimal boundary layer mixing. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and steady wind direction points to a developing afternoon convection risk, particularly in the late afternoon hours.
