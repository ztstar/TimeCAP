Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a gradual回暖 starting in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a warmer air mass. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high humidity interspersed with sudden drops, indicating possible precipitation events earlier in the day. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, particularly from the northwest, before subsiding and shifting toward more easterly directions, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and improving temperature trends points to improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures in the coming hours.
