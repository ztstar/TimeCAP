Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels surged during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal boundary layer and subsequent drying as the sun rose. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the mid-morning and early afternoon, followed by a sudden drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system, potentially a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from easterly to northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight regime to a more unstable, drier, and potentially storm-prone daytime atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of convective activity later in the day.
