Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend during the afternoon, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, suggesting increased moisture and potential for fog formation, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, then stabilized and slightly declined, signaling a shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained low initially, with near-zero values during the early morning, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the east-southeast, indicating a change in wind patterns possibly driven by a developing sea breeze. Combined, these trends suggest the influence of a coastal marine layer and shifting synoptic conditions, which may lead to cooler, foggy mornings and clearer, breezier afternoons in the coming hours.
