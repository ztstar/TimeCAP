Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the overnight hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. A pronounced drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, followed by a slow recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted dramatically during the night, transitioning from predominantly westerly to southerly and then to more variable directions, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and changing wind direction points to recent storm activity, with conditions now stabilizing but potentially leaving the city vulnerable to lingering moisture and cooler temperatures.
