Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a stable temperature profile during the first 19 hours, followed by a notable rise in heat, suggesting the onset of warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high initially, then dropped sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a drying trend that may signal clearing skies or the approach of a drier air mass. Air pressure increased significantly during the evening, which is typically associated with improving weather and the arrival of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to clearer conditions. Wind speeds diminished in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest, implying a change in atmospheric flow that may be linked to the high-pressure development. These combined changes suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions to drier, more settled weather, potentially leading to improved visibility and more comfortable temperatures in the coming hours.
