Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the pre-dawn hours, reaching near saturation, before plummeting sharply during mid-morning, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a rise in wind speed, indicating the approach of a weather system. Winds strengthened and shifted from southerly to more westerly directions, potentially signaling the influence of a coastal low-pressure system or a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined changes point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing increased cloud cover, possible precipitation, and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
