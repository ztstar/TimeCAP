Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, reaching saturation at multiple intervals, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a slight increase in the mid-to-late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and westerly, possibly signaling the influence of a developing surface boundary or storm system. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, with lingering moisture and unstable air potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
