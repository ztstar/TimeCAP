Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a slight warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, indicating increasing moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially from midday onward, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with a shift in wind direction from a southerly to a more westerly and then southwesterly flow, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and weakening winds points to a high probability of lingering coastal fog and stable, cool conditions through the coming hours.
