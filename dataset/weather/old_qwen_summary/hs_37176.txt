Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, followed by a dramatic drop during the late morning and afternoon, signaling a drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the northeast and east, likely due to a developing surface pressure gradient. This combination of cooling, drying, and increasing winds points to the transition into a more stable and drier atmospheric regime, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but potentially increasing fire risk.
