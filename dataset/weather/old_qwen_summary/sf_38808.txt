Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the onset of fog or low clouds typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, particularly during the early morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning hours, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, before diminishing and becoming light and variable in the afternoon. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and stable temperature trends points to a clearing pattern, with improved visibility and potentially sunny conditions expected in the coming hours.
