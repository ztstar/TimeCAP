Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking during the early hours before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy, moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure rose steadily through the middle of the night and early morning, then sharply declined toward the end of the period, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that may bring changeable weather. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the late night and early morning, only to increase again in the final hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from prevailing westerly to northeasterly, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. These dynamics point to the influence of a coastal frontal system, likely bringing overcast skies and possible light precipitation in the near term.
