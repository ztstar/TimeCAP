Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during midday hours, followed by a significant rise in the early morning, suggesting increased moisture advection or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with onshore flow and enhanced sea breeze effects. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest, combined with rising pressure and warming temperatures, points to the development of a more settled, coastal high-pressure regime.
