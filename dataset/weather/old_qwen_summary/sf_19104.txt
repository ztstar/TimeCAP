Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by marine influence and fog development. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which is consistent with fog formation and low cloud cover typical of the city’s microclimate. A gradual drop in air pressure, especially in the latter half of the period, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning and late afternoon, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more easterly direction, which may indicate changing atmospheric flow patterns across the Bay Area. These combined factors point to a persistent marine layer, with conditions favoring foggy, cool, and damp weather through the remainder of the day.
