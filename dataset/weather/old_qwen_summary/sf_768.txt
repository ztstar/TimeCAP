Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升 in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, contributing to foggy conditions, before sharply decreasing during the midday, indicating a drying trend likely due to increasing solar heating and wind activity. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early and mid-day, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing conditions overnight. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, promoting mixing and dispersion of fog and moisture. The shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to more southerly and easterly later in the day signals a change in airflow patterns, potentially influencing the arrival of warmer, drier air or an onshore flow that could affect coastal temperatures and visibility.
