Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable daytime conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, saturated air to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system and potential for developing storm activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and southwesterly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors—cooling followed by warming, falling pressure, increasing wind, and shifting wind direction—point to an unstable atmospheric setup, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
