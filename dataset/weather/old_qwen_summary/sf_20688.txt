Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation levels throughout the night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, which has since begun to subside. Air pressure remained stable, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement, consistent with a persistent high-pressure ridge influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast in the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These conditions point to a transition from foggy, damp overnight conditions to clearer, slightly warmer daytime weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
