Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the early afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, dropping significantly during midday and spiking sharply in the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of fog formation and dissipation, particularly near coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day but dipped notably toward the end, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind patterns were inconsistent, with strong southerly and westerly flows during the day giving way to calm conditions at night, possibly contributing to the formation and persistence of fog. The combination of low nighttime humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind directions points to dynamic coastal weather processes, likely resulting in foggy mornings and clearer skies during the afternoon.
