Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature fluctuations. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining, which suggests increasing moisture content in the lower atmosphere conducive to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low and variable throughout, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly northwest to southerly and then easterly in the late morning, potentially indicating changing airflow patterns associated with a developing weather front. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing instability and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms as daytime heating interacts with residual moisture and shifting wind patterns.
