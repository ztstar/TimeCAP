Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable shift from cooler, humid conditions in the early morning to a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar heating and changing air masses. Humidity levels showed a dramatic fluctuation, peaking during the overnight hours before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier inflow. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, reaching a sustained high, which is typically associated with fair weather and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong throughout, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, reinforcing the transport of warm, moist air into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, dropping humidity, and stable high pressure suggests a transition toward a more comfortable and sunny afternoon and evening, with reduced likelihood of precipitation.
