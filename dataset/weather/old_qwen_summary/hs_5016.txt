Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a shift toward more stable and elevated temperatures. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, suggesting overnight saturation and potential for fog or dew formation, followed by a significant drying trend as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, especially during the late night and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system capable of bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the early morning and evening, with strong gusts from the south and southeast, possibly linked to a developing frontal boundary. The erratic wind direction, shifting from southerly to northerly and back, further supports dynamic atmospheric conditions that could lead to thunderstorms or rapid weather changes in the near term.
