Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, with near-saturated conditions persisting for extended durations, which supports the presence of fog and low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited minor fluctuations, with a slight downward trend in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the early morning and late evening, corresponding with changes in wind direction that indicate shifts in local coastal airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a persistent marine influence, likely maintaining cool, foggy conditions through the night and early morning, with clearing expected as the day advances and wind patterns stabilize.
