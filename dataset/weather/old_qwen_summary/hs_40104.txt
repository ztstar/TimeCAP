Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising again, indicating a nocturnal temperature inversion followed by a recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting drier air infiltration, likely due to changing wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which typically signals the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, associated with stable and fair weather. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with a strong surge in the early hours followed by more moderate and variable winds, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable regime, likely leading to clearer skies and improved conditions in the near term.
