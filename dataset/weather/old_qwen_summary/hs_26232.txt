Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime heating. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early morning and again in the late evening, suggesting elevated moisture availability, likely linked to fog or dew formation. A notable decline in air pressure occurred during the overnight hours, particularly around the time of peak humidity, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the night and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including strong southerly and easterly flows, potentially indicating the influence of a frontal boundary or storm system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests a heightened potential for thunderstorm development, particularly in the late afternoon or evening hours.
