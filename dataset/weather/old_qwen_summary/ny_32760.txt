Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before rising slightly, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more easterly, consistent with changing airflow around the low-pressure system. These patterns collectively suggest a dynamic weather transition, potentially bringing precipitation and unsettled conditions to New York City in the near term.
