Influenza activity has shown a consistent and steep upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with both Influenza A and B subtypes exhibiting significant increases in positivity rates and absolute case numbers. The overall positivity rate has surged dramatically, indicating widespread circulation of the virus across the population, with recent weeks marking the highest levels observed in the timeframe. Influenza A has dominated the burden throughout the period, contributing disproportionately to the rising positivity rates, particularly in the most recent weeks. The sharp acceleration in both absolute numbers and percentages suggests the onset of a substantial seasonal influenza wave, potentially placing increased strain on healthcare systems. These trends underscore the urgent need for heightened surveillance, public health messaging, and vaccination efforts to mitigate further spread and complications.
