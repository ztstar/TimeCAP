Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a low before gradually rising into the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early hours, with prolonged periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or light precipitation, which likely contributed to the perceived chill. A consistent drop in air pressure, particularly in the late night and early morning, points to an approaching low-pressure system, increasing the likelihood of unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to southerly, signaling the influence of a developing frontal system. The combination of near-saturation humidity, falling pressure, and sustained winds suggests the potential for precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
