Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure accompanied by rising humidity and increasing wind speeds indicates the approach and passage of a strong low-pressure system. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly, suggesting the system moved through the region, bringing in colder, drier air from the north. A sharp rise in humidity to near saturation levels during the early morning hours, followed by a dramatic decrease in the afternoon, points to precipitation that likely occurred overnight. The sustained high wind speeds, particularly in the final hours, reflect strong frontal passage and may have contributed to gusty conditions and localized disruptions. Overall, the data suggests a dynamic and unsettled weather pattern, with the potential for continued stormy conditions or rapidly changing skies in the immediate forecast.
