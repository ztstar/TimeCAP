Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rebound, suggesting the influence of nocturnal cooling and subsequent solar warming. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with periods of near-saturated conditions alternating with sharp dry spells, indicative of shifting air masses and possible fog formation or dissipation. Air pressure exhibited significant spikes, particularly in the early hours, signaling the passage of a strong high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably from strong westerly to southerly and then northerly flows, with increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon, potentially linked to coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition from a fog-prone, stable maritime environment to a drier, more variable regime, with implications for visibility, comfort, and potential for afternoon wind events.
