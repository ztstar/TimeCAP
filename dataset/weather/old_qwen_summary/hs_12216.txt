Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual temperature rise, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and increasing atmospheric stability. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, followed by a steady decline as temperatures climbed. Air pressure showed a slight drop during the night, followed by a modest rise in the late afternoon, signaling possible changes in large-scale weather systems, though no strong low-pressure development was evident. Wind conditions were generally light and variable overnight, shifting to more consistent easterly and southerly flows in the late afternoon, potentially bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of rising temperatures, lingering high humidity, and wind shifts hints at a developing pattern conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if instability increases further.
