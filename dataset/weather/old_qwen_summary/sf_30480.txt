Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp drop in the midday hours, indicating possible drying out due to increased wind and solar heating, while elevated humidity in the early morning suggests fog formation or low-level moisture retention. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which is often associated with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the midday period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, suggesting a change in synoptic flow likely driven by a coastal trough or land-sea breeze interaction. The combination of falling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition from a maritime-influenced, fog-prone regime to a drier, more stable atmosphere, potentially signaling clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day.
