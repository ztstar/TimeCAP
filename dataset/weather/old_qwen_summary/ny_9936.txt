Over the past 24 hours, a sharp drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant overnight cooling phase likely associated with clear skies and radiative heat loss. A notable and sustained decrease in air pressure during the late night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which is consistent with deteriorating conditions and the onset of precipitation. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning, reflecting increasing moisture content in the atmosphere, which, combined with the pressure drop, supports the likelihood of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly west-northwest to strong southerly flow around dawn, signaling a change in air mass and likely contributing to the movement of the storm system into the region. These combined trends point to a developing storm event, with potential for rain or snow, particularly during the early morning hours, impacting travel and outdoor activities across New York City.
