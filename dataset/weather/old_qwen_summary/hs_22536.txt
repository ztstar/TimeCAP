Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating patterns. Humidity levels showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon, suggesting drying air mass progression, which may reduce the likelihood of convective activity. Air pressure exhibited a slight downward trend in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approaching weather disturbance, though no significant drop was recorded to indicate a storm system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to west-southwest in the evening, potentially bringing drier air from inland regions. Overall, the conditions point to a transitioning atmosphere with a weakening nocturnal inversion and increasing daytime heating, which could support isolated afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture were present.
