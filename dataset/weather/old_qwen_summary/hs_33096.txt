Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nighttime cooling trend followed by a significant daytime warming, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation typical of a humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and elevated discomfort. A noticeable shift in wind patterns occurred midday, with a change in wind direction from southerly to easterly and a marked increase in wind speed, suggesting the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the night, but a sharp rise in the early afternoon coincided with clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. These combined factors point to a transition from a stable, humid nighttime environment to a more dynamic, warming daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
