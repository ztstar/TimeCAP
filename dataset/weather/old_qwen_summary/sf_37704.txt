Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning hours before a slight recovery during the afternoon. Humidity remained elevated throughout most of the period, particularly during the early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the southeast and east, suggesting a shift in atmospheric dynamics linked to the pressure changes. These conditions imply the influence of a coastal frontal system, which may have brought cooler, moister air and contributed to unstable weather, particularly during the early hours.
