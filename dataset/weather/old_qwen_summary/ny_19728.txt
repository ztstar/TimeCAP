Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the onset of a more stable and milder period. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply, indicating a shift in air mass that may have brought in drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase, especially in the late morning and early afternoon, which is typically associated with improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with only a brief uptick in the mid-afternoon, while wind direction shifted steadily from southwest to southeast, suggesting a change in circulation patterns. Overall, the combination of rising pressure, increasing temperature, and shifting wind direction points toward clearing skies and more favorable weather conditions in the immediate hours ahead.
