Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a marked diurnal pattern, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a significant fluctuation, with a notable rise in the early morning hours followed by stabilization, indicating a shift in atmospheric stability that may have supported the formation of a marine layer. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with a brief increase in the early morning hours followed by near-calms during midday, consistent with the typical inland wind patterns during fog events. The wind direction shifted from a southerly to a more westerly and then northerly component, reflecting dynamic changes in local circulation, possibly linked to the influence of coastal upwelling and the passage of a high-pressure system.
