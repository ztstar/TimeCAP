Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising again in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which may have contributed to the cooler perceived temperatures. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable calm period around dawn, followed by a moderate increase in the afternoon, likely driven by shifting wind patterns from the southwest and west. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then back to southerly suggests possible changes in local air circulation, potentially influencing the development of afternoon convection later in the day.
