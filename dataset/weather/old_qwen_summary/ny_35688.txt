Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a substantial cold front passage. Humidity remained near saturation for the first 20 hours, suggesting persistent cloud cover and potential for precipitation, which likely contributed to the cooling trend. Air pressure declined steadily during the early hours, reaching a minimum before stabilizing and rising, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were moderate initially, increasing notably in the latter half of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to increasingly westerly, consistent with changing storm dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition from damp, cool weather to drier, more stable conditions, with improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the immediate hours ahead.
