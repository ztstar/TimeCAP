Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly overnight before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, beginning high, dropping sharply during midday, and then spiking again in the evening, indicating possible fog or cloud formation followed by clearing. Air pressure remained consistently high, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clear skies and calm weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late evening, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, potentially influencing coastal fog patterns. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests changing air mass dynamics, which may signal the approach of a more dynamic weather pattern later in the day.
