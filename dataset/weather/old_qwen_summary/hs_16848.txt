Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, which suggests the presence of overnight condensation and dew formation, likely contributing to a muggy feel. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling the approach or influence of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearing weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the morning and evening, with a noticeable reduction during the night, while wind direction shifted from southeast to more easterly and then southeasterly, indicating a change in circulation patterns possibly linked to a developing surface high. These indicators collectively suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, with potential for clearer skies and improved comfort as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
