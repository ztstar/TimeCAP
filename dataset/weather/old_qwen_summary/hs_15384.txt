Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a progression toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high for much of the day, especially during early morning and late night hours, suggesting saturated air and potential for fog or drizzle. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather system or the onset of convective activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, possibly indicating an approaching front or storm system. Combined, these trends suggest a dynamic and potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
