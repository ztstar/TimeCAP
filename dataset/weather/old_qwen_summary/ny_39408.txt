Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours suggests the influence of a low-pressure system, which may have brought unstable weather and increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, particularly in the early morning, with gusts accompanied by shifting wind directions, hinting at dynamic atmospheric conditions. The recent rise in pressure and wind stabilization in the late afternoon indicates a possible transition toward more settled weather, though residual moisture may still lead to overcast skies or light showers.
