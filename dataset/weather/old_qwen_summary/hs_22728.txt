Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before steadily declining, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, which may signal the influence of a developing sea breeze or localized circulation. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a warmer, breezier daytime pattern, consistent with typical coastal Texas summer weather dynamics.
