Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and sustaining near-maximal values, indicating the presence of moist air likely influenced by marine layer conditions. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight overall decline, suggesting a period of atmospheric instability that may precede changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, hinting at a possible change in airflow dynamics. Combined, these indicators suggest the city is transitioning from a stable, fog-prone marine layer regime toward a potentially more dynamic period with shifting wind patterns and clearing conditions later in the day.
