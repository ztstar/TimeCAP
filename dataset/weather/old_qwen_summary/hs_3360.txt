Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, reaching peak values that suggest a high potential for dew formation or fog development. Air pressure steadily declined, especially in the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and eventually easterly, consistent with moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors point to an increased likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the coming hours, especially as warm, moist air continues to accumulate along the coast.
