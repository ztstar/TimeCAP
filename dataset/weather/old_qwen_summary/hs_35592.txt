Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a developing daytime heating phase. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal inversion followed by air mass modification. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak just before midday, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system bringing drier, more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight and increased slightly in the afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east and then to the northeast, signaling a change in circulation patterns. The combination of rising pressure, falling humidity, and shifting winds points to a transition toward fair and drier weather, though lingering moisture from earlier in the day could support isolated afternoon showers.
