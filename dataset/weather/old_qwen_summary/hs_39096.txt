Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the pre-dawn hours, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from primarily southerly to more westerly and northwesterly, signaling a change in air mass. These conditions point to a transition period, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies and improving comfort levels as the night progresses.
