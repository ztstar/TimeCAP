Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cool overnight period. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moist air mass that may contribute to dew formation or fog. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly from mid-morning onward, signaling the approach or establishment of a high-pressure system associated with stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more westerly, which may indicate changing airflow patterns. Overall, the data suggests improving conditions with clearing skies and strengthening high pressure, likely leading to dry and comfortable weather in the coming hours.
