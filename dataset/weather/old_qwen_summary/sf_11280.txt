Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained low during the night and early morning, then surged significantly in the mid-morning and again in the late evening, suggesting increased moisture availability or fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent pattern of minor fluctuations with a notable drop in the late afternoon, indicating possible approaching weather systems. Wind conditions were generally light and variable, with brief periods of stronger winds and abrupt shifts in direction, particularly during the late night and early morning, which may have contributed to localized mixing and fog development. These combined patterns point to a dynamic transition period likely associated with marine layer influence and possible fog or low cloud cover, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic conditions.
