Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the early morning and late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a transient high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, indicating changing airflow patterns possibly linked to a frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition period, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
