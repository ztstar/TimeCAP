Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to the city. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight followed by a modest warming in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from a cool, damp period to potentially milder conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to foggy or misty conditions. Wind patterns shifted from consistent southerly to more variable directions in the late afternoon, with a notable increase in speed and a change toward the southwest, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of precipitation, particularly in the coming hours, with a greater chance of rain or drizzle as the low-pressure system moves in.
