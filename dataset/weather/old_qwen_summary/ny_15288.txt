Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a passing cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the evening and night, reaching a minimum around midday, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to stronger, more consistent winds from the west and northwest, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined signals point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increased chances of precipitation and cooler temperatures in the near term.
