Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to a drier, more unstable atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of an atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the west and northwest, implying a shift in circulation patterns that could influence storm development. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing pressure, and increasing wind suggests a developing instability that may lead to afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
