Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, remaining high through mid-morning before sharply decreasing, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions, with a slight decline in the final hours that may signal a shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the early morning and again toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly, consistent with onshore flow. These changes collectively suggest a cooling marine layer dissipated during the day, likely due to solar warming, resulting in improving visibility and a transition toward more typical coastal afternoon conditions.
