Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, sharply dropping in the midday hours before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions and possible clearing. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a brief intensification in the late afternoon and early evening, associated with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, likely driven by a developing coastal breeze pattern. These trends collectively point to a morning fog event followed by gradual clearing and warming, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimatic behavior during the summer months.
