Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature plateau and reduced solar heating. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or a change in atmospheric circulation. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with stronger onshore flow, possibly enhancing coastal fog dissipation. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day.
