Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in Houston showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, indicating a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching near saturation before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, with a slight rise during midday, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of active storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to northeast during the early morning hours, which may reflect a change in air mass or the influence of a local pressure gradient. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and shifting winds points to a developing afternoon heating effect, potentially increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms if moisture and instability continue to accumulate.
