Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight followed by a steady warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, then dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from damp to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southeasterly to more variable and westerly, which may indicate changing air mass influences. Overall, the data points to a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, clearing afternoon, with favorable conditions likely persisting into the coming hours.
