Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon—suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun rose. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling the possible arrival of a weak frontal system. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts coming from the south and west, reinforcing offshore flow conditions. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable marine layer to a drier, more dynamic air mass, likely leading to clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
