Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, which contributed to a muggy feel and increased discomfort. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting the potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly and then easterly in the late evening, signaling a possible change in air mass. This shift, combined with rising humidity and warming temperatures, may indicate the onset of a more humid and potentially storm-prone regime in the coming hours.
