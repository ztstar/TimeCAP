Over the past 24 hours, temperatures remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual rise through the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning hours, peaking in the early hours before dropping, suggesting possible nocturnal condensation or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds exhibited variability, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction—particularly from southerly to westerly—indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition toward more settled and drier conditions, likely reducing the chance of precipitation in the immediate future.
