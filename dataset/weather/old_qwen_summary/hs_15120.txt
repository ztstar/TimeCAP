Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rebound, indicating the passage of a significant weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling overnight, with a pronounced dip in the early hours, followed by a steady rise during the day, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking near the end of the observation window, which increases the likelihood of discomfort and potential for thunderstorms. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northerly directions, aligning with the movement of the low-pressure system and contributing to the destabilization of the atmosphere. These combined indicators point to an unstable weather regime, increasing the risk of convective activity and localized storms in the near term.
