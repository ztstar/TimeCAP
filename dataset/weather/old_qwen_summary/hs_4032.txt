Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong warming trend likely driven by solar insolation and subsiding air. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, starting high and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight decline in the final hours, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally low during the day, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may indicate the influence of a developing low-level circulation. These combined patterns suggest the potential for convective activity later in the day or overnight, especially given the drying trend and increasing instability.
