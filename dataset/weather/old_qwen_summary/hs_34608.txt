Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by changing solar exposure and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during nighttime and early morning, with periods of saturation indicating potential for fog or mist formation, especially when temperatures dropped. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slight declines, signaling stable or improving weather conditions with possible high-pressure dominance. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate during the day but intensified significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may indicate a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increased wind activity suggests a transition period, potentially setting the stage for unsettled conditions later in the day.
