Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before declining steadily as the day progressed, indicating the passage of a moist air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southeasterly in the late evening, which may signal a change in airflow associated with the approaching system. These trends collectively point to the potential for increasing cloud cover and the likelihood of precipitation later in the night or early the next morning.
