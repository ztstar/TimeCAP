Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought changing weather conditions. Temperature trends indicate a prolonged cold period during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a front or shifting air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking before declining, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation during those hours. Wind speeds increased notably during the mid-morning and late evening, with variable directions indicating turbulent air flow, possibly linked to the low-pressure development. These combined patterns point to an active weather transition, potentially resulting in precipitation or unstable conditions in the near term.
