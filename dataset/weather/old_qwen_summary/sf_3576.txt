Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before plummeting during midday, likely due to a shift in air mass and the influence of offshore winds. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and early morning, then increased again in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, which may have brought warmer air from inland regions. These dynamics point to a transition from marine-influenced conditions to a more stable, inland-dominated pattern, potentially leading to drier and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
