Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and declined gradually through the day, suggesting a reduction in moisture content as the atmosphere warmed. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking midday before showing a slight decline, which typically signals the passage of a high-pressure system and favorable weather conditions. Wind speeds showed moderate variability, with brief intensifications in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, implying changing air mass influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable maritime environment toward a drier, slightly warmer regime, likely resulting in clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
