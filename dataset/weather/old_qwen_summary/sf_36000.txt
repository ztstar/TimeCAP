Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually warming during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable until mid-morning, when a slight increase indicated the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, likely contributing to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were generally low overnight but increased during the late night and early morning, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly due to local topography or sea breeze dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns suggests a high likelihood of fog persistence in the early hours, with gradual clearing expected as daytime heating and stable pressure conditions take hold.
