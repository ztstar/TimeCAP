Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated through the early hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with changing air mass dynamics. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, driven by shifting wind directions from the south and west, possibly due to coastal influences. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and strengthening afternoon winds points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, likely reducing the likelihood of fog or precipitation in the coming hours.
