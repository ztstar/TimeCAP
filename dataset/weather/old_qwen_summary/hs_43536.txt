Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, suggesting high moisture content in the air, which may contribute to increased discomfort and potential for localized thunderstorm development. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the day, hinting at the influence of a building high-pressure system that may be suppressing storm activity but could also lead to clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased significantly in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly associated with a developing or approaching frontal boundary. The combination of rising temperatures, sustained high humidity, and variable winds points to a high potential for convective activity later in the day, warranting attention for possible thunderstorms.
