Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with sustained high readings in the early and late periods, suggesting persistent moisture and possible fog formation. A notable shift in air pressure occurred mid-night, with a sharp rise followed by a sustained high-pressure system, indicating stable conditions and clearing skies. Wind activity was intermittent, with strong gusts in the early morning and late evening, particularly from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the cooling and fog dispersal. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and windy night into a progressively clearer and milder day, typical of San Francisco’s coastal microclimate.
