Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a steady decline during the day, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with notable increases during the early morning and late afternoon, suggesting the passage of transient weather systems. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, particularly during the evening hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined indicators suggest the influence of a frontal system, potentially bringing unstable conditions and the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
