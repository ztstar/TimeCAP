Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or misty conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting no major storm systems are influencing the region, though a slight drop in the early hours may have contributed to increased moisture. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to a more westerly flow, consistent with typical coastal patterns. These trends suggest a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, with potential for fog in the early morning and improving visibility later in the day.
