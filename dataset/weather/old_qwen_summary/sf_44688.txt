The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has been exceptionally stable, with no measurable fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. This lack of variation indicates a persistent and unchanging atmospheric regime, likely due to a strong, stable high-pressure system dominating the region. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a steady maritime influence, which, combined with very low humidity, points to dry and clear conditions typical of a coastal subsidence inversion. With no signs of instability or change in pressure, there is little to no potential for precipitation or storm development in the immediate forecast. Overall, the environment remains calm and dry, conducive to comfortable daytime conditions but with elevated fire risk due to the persistent arid air and steady winds.
