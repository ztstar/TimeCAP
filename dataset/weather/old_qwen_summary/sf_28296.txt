Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through midday, indicating a strong marine influence and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stabilizing conditions and reducing wind speeds. Wind patterns shifted from offshore to onshore flows, with sustained easterly and northeasterly winds during the night and early morning, which may have transported marine air inland and enhanced fog development. The combination of sustained high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind directions points to a high likelihood of fog or low clouds persisting into the early morning hours, impacting visibility and local microclimates.
