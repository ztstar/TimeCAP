Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cold night and warming day. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early morning hours but increased significantly in the late night and early morning, suggesting possible moisture buildup, though it did not lead to precipitation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, peaking in the afternoon, which is indicative of a high-pressure system influencing the region, generally associated with stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the night and early morning, with a notable reduction in the early hours, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, accompanied by variable wind directions, including shifts toward more southerly and westerly flows. Overall, the data points to a transition from a cool, dry, and stable night into a warming, increasingly dry, and stable daytime, with no immediate signs of storm activity or significant weather disruption.
