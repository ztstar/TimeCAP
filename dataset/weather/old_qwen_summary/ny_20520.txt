Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the influence of a shifting air mass. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night, dropping slightly during the mid-morning before rising sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting increasing moisture content in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the early hours, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or low-pressure development. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast in the late afternoon, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends point to the potential for deteriorating weather conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
