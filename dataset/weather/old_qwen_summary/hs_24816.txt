Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a slight overall decline, with a notable drop in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a significant shift from southerly to northerly and easterly flows, which may signal a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition period, potentially bringing unstable conditions and a higher likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
