Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the late night and early morning, remaining near saturation before plummeting sharply during the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable decrease in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to stronger and more consistent from the northwest and west during the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the onset of onshore flow. These combined trends suggest a transition from a foggy, cool night to a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for increasing wind and changing conditions later in the day.
