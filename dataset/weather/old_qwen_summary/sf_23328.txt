Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a stabilization and rise in surface temperatures. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure steadily increased, especially during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicating a transition in airflow patterns that may be linked to changing synoptic conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable and dry conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of fog and lowering the chance of precipitation in the near term.
