Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a period of persistent high humidity, particularly during the early morning and night hours, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to a damp, muggy feel. Temperature trends showed a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, suggesting a warming trend influenced by solar heating and atmospheric stability. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating the absence of strong frontal systems, but a slight rise in the afternoon may hint at improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southeasterly, which could signal the approach of a moist maritime influence. Combined with sustained high humidity and rising temperatures, these conditions create a favorable environment for isolated thunderstorm development later in the day.
