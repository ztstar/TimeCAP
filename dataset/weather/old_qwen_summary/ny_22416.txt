Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual rise in the morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before gradually decreasing, suggesting a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which is often associated with the approach or passage of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low until mid-afternoon, when they intensified and maintained a stronger flow from the west-northwest, likely contributing to the mixing of air and the dispersion of moisture. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and decreasing humidity implies improving weather conditions, with a higher likelihood of clear skies and mild temperatures in the near term.
