Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by gradual warming during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more convective air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase overnight and a minor decline in the late afternoon, consistent with a weak high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable reduction during the early morning hours, likely due to reduced thermal gradients and a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and west, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity in the morning, decreasing wind speeds, and a stable pressure pattern may have created favorable conditions for fog formation and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
