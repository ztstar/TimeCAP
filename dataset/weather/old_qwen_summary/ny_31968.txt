Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a notable cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then began to rise, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and fair weather. Wind speeds were light and variable through the night, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, possibly indicating a change in airflow associated with the approaching high. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a humid, cooler overnight period to a drier, gradually warming day ahead, consistent with the arrival of a stable high-pressure system affecting New York City.
