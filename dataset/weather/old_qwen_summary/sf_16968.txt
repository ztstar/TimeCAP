Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that would bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with a shift toward more variable but still light winds in the afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, hinting at evolving circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, cool night to a clearer, slightly warmer day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
