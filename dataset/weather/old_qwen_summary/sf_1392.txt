Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s maritime climate. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought overcast conditions and light precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a strong gusty period in the pre-dawn hours, likely driven by a coastal wind surge, followed by a sharp drop in wind activity during midday. The shift in wind direction from the west to the southwest and later to the south-southwest reflects changing synoptic patterns, potentially indicating the influence of a developing ridge or the end of a coastal upwelling event.
