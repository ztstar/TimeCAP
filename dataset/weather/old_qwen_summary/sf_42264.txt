Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions during the pre-dawn hours. A steady increase in air pressure, particularly in the afternoon and evening, suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to local topography and coastal influences. These conditions together imply a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with potential for improved visibility and reduced fog later in the day.
