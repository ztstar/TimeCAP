Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning before a slight rebound in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to a damp and oppressive feel, particularly during the early hours. A notable increase in air pressure, especially during the late evening and early morning, suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, indicating improving and drier conditions ahead. Wind speeds intensified after midnight, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by shifting wind directions from southerly to westerly and northerly, which may signal a change in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of falling temperatures, high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing winds points to a transition toward more stable and cooler weather, potentially clearing any lingering cloud cover and reducing the risk of precipitation.
