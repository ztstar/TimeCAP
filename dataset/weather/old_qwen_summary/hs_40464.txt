Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early morning hours and possible precipitation later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during midday, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought dry conditions earlier but now appears to be weakening. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and southeast, which could enhance moisture advection and contribute to the development of thunderstorms. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly patterns may signal an approaching weather front, increasing the likelihood of unstable conditions and convective activity in the coming hours.
