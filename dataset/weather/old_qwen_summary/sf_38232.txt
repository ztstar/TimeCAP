Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night, particularly in the early hours, indicating strong fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum. Air pressure showed a steady increase from mid-morning onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that would stabilize conditions and suppress cloud development. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with stronger gusts in the early and late evening, driven by shifting wind directions that suggest complex local circulation patterns, including land-sea breezes and downslope flows. These combined factors point to a transition from a foggy, cool nighttime regime toward a clearer, milder daytime pattern, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather dynamics.
