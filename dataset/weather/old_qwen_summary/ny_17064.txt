Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity increased significantly after midnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests moisture buildup and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a gradual drop in the late afternoon, signaling possible approaching weather changes. Wind speeds were moderate during the night, with a notable increase in the early morning followed by a sharp reduction in the afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions suggesting a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, dropping pressure, and variable winds points to a likely transition toward unsettled weather, potentially including precipitation later in the day.
