Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, peaking at saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating strong moisture presence in the atmosphere. Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching their lowest point just before dawn, followed by a modest recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting nighttime radiative cooling and a slow warming trend. Air pressure remained stable throughout the day, showing no significant fluctuations, which implies a persistent, stable air mass over the region with minimal storm development. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable decrease in intensity during the early morning hours and a gradual increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, typical of marine layer dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a strong marine layer influence, likely resulting in fog and low clouds, especially during early morning hours, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s coastal climate and has implications for visibility, travel, and daily outdoor activities.
