Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-to-late morning before a sharp decline, suggesting the dissipation of moisture likely due to warming and increased mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase during the late afternoon before a drop in the evening, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system or shifting air mass. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, indicating changing circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a stable, humid nocturnal environment to a more dynamic daytime regime, potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift remain.
