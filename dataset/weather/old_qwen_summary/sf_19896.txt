Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of a persistent moisture layer that may have contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity, though a slight drop toward the end of the period could signal a developing change in conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases in the early morning and late evening, and wind direction shifted notably from northerly to southerly and then to more easterly and westerly patterns, reflecting local circulation changes. These conditions point to a transition period likely influenced by marine layer dynamics, with the potential for fog dissipation during the day and a possible shift toward clearer skies if pressure trends continue.
