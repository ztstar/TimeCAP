Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels remained high during the early and late hours, particularly in the overnight period, indicating potential for fog formation, which is consistent with the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a peak in the early morning followed by a sharp drop, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and early evening, especially from the east-southeast, likely driven by a shift in wind direction and the influence of a developing coastal breeze. These combined factors suggest the presence of a dynamic marine layer and possible fog or drizzle later in the day, particularly along the waterfront and western neighborhoods.
