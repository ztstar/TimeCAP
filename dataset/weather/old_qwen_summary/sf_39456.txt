Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and remaining low through the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover during the night. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, which may have contributed to the mixing of air masses and the dissipation of fog. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and strong winds points to an active weather system influencing the region, likely bringing unsettled conditions into the coming hours.
