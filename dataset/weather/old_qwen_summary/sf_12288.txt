Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating an approaching weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly around midday, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest to west, consistent with marine layer dynamics. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest in the evening further supports the influence of coastal airflow, potentially signaling increasing windiness and cooler conditions ahead.
