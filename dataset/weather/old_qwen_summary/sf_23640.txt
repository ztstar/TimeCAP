Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend toward the late afternoon, indicating a cooling night and a warming day. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation throughout the night and early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure showed a notable rise, particularly in the early hours, stabilizing at a high value and remaining elevated, signaling the influence of a strong high-pressure system that likely suppressed precipitation and contributed to clear skies. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that shifted slightly toward the west and northwest in the afternoon, possibly enhancing coastal ventilation. Together, these conditions reflect a stable, fog-prone marine layer that has persisted, with warming and clearing expected as the high-pressure system continues to dominate.
