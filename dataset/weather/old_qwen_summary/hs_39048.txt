Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a more typical daytime heating cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, reducing visibility and maintaining a damp feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight dip in the early morning may reflect localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and then southwesterly, which could signal the approach or passage of a shallow boundary or localized convective activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and strengthening winds points to an environment conducive to the development of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
