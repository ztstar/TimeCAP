A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours of the day, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in tandem with the pressure drop, peaking near saturation, which contributed to oppressive air and the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably, particularly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting evolving storm dynamics. The sustained high humidity and falling pressure were consistent with a developing weather front, increasing the risk of heavy rain or thunderstorms. These conditions collectively point to a potentially disruptive weather event affecting New York City, with implications for travel, outdoor activities, and public safety.
