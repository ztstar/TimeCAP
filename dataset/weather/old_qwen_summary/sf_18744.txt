Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation, which suggests persistent moisture in the air and a strong likelihood of fog or overcast conditions. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a minor decline in the late afternoon and early evening, potentially signaling the approach of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily during the day, reaching peak values in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. Together, these conditions point to a transition toward more dynamic weather, possibly bringing increased cloud cover, fog, or light precipitation in the coming hours.
