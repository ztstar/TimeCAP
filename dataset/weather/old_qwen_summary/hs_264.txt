Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, followed by a sharp drop overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early hours, stabilizing at a high value before declining slightly in the late afternoon, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm activity. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions and variable wind direction, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, possibly due to a shift in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight environment to a warmer, drier daytime regime, with implications for heat stress and possible afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
