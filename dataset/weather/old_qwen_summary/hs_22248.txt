Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained consistently high, approaching saturation, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds decreased in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting to a more southerly to southwesterly direction, consistent with moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico. Collectively, these conditions point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm development, especially during the overnight hours, due to the combination of warmth, moisture, and atmospheric instability.
