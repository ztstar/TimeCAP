Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence. Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a low before slowly rising into the afternoon, reflecting typical coastal cooling patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend during the day, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and limited storm development. Wind speeds were generally light, with consistent northerly to westerly flow, reinforcing the presence of a stable marine layer that suppresses convection. These conditions collectively point to a cool, foggy, and stable coastal environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with little chance of significant weather changes in the immediate future.
