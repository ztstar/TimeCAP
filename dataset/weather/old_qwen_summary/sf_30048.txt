Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist to dry conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable low around dawn, suggesting the passage of a weather front, which may have contributed to the overnight temperature drop and increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the south-southeast, aligning with a shift in pressure systems. The consistent wind direction from the south-southeast in the early hours, followed by a shift to more variable and weaker winds later, points to changing atmospheric dynamics likely associated with a frontal passage, potentially leading to unstable conditions in the coming hours.
