Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by overnight cloud cover and morning dew formation. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching saturation multiple times, which suggests the presence of fog or dew and likely contributed to a damp, muggy feel. A significant drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, followed by a rapid recovery, pointing to the passage of a transient weather system or localized convergence. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, with increased speeds in the late evening, which may have facilitated the mixing of moist air and the dispersion of surface-level stagnation. Overall, the combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting winds indicates a transition phase that could precede the development of thunderstorms or showery conditions later in the day.
