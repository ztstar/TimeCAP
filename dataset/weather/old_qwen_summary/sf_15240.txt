Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the night, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and remained low, while wind direction shifted from southwest to more west-southwest, consistent with a coastal flow pattern. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with fog and cool air dominating the early hours, followed by clearing skies and milder temperatures as the day progressed.
