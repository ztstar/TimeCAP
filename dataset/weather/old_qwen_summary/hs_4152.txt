Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels spiked to near saturation during the early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during the calmest hours. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unstable weather conditions later. Wind speeds were minimal during the pre-dawn hours, with calm periods coinciding with peak humidity and temperature minima, leading to potential air stagnation. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly suggests a change in air mass, possibly signaling the influence of a frontal boundary that could lead to precipitation later in the day.
