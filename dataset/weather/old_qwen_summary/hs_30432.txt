Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature followed by a sharp increase during the late afternoon and evening, indicating the onset of a warm, sunny period. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early and middle hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the overnight hours, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with a developing low-pressure influence. Together, these trends suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially storm-prone conditions, warranting attention for possible afternoon thunderstorms.
