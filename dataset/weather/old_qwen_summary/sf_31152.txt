Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, with temperatures dropping to their lowest point before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere and likely contributing to fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a sharp rebound in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure front, that brought cooler, moister conditions. Wind speeds increased during the early evening and again in the late night, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to more southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing airflow patterns influenced by coastal dynamics. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to an active coastal weather regime, likely resulting in foggy conditions and cooler temperatures—typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
