Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight drop in the early morning hours followed by a modest increase, indicating the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases during the late night and early afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These conditions suggest a clearing trend with improving daytime weather, though residual moisture may lead to localized fog or low clouds in the early morning hours.
