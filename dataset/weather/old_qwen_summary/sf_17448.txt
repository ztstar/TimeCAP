Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating high moisture content and favorable conditions for fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall but increased in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and eventually the northwest—consistent with the onset of a coastal wind pattern. This combination of cooling, high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds points to a high likelihood of fog or low-lying clouds developing overnight, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
