Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the night, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, likely due to condensation and reduced air mixing, which contributed to a persistent foggy or overcast condition. Air pressure exhibited a sharp decline during the early hours, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which was associated with increased cloud cover and wind activity, before stabilizing at a high-pressure regime in the late afternoon. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief bursts and shifts in direction, suggesting a brief period of stormy or unsettled conditions before the system settled. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and stable pressure in the latter half of the period points to clearing skies and improving conditions, setting the stage for a warmer, more comfortable day ahead.
