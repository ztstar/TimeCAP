Influenza activity has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, peaking in recent weeks before beginning a notable decline. The proportion of positive specimens has risen sharply, reaching its highest levels in the last quarter of the period, indicating intense transmission. Influenza A has consistently contributed the majority of positive cases and has driven the overall surge, with its share of positivity increasing steadily. Influenza B, while initially trailing, has demonstrated a strong and sustained presence, particularly in the latter half, suggesting co-circulation and potential for prolonged seasonal impact. The recent decline in positivity rates, especially in the most recent weeks, may reflect waning epidemic intensity, though vigilance remains critical due to high residual levels.
