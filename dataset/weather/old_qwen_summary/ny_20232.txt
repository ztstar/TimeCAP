Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a return to milder conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the midday, suggesting a possible transition from damp, stable air to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions, potentially including precipitation. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, with a slight increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, which often precedes storm development. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather shift, with the potential for unstable conditions and possible precipitation later in the day.
