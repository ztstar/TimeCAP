Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation, which may have reduced visibility during those periods. Air pressure dropped significantly overnight, particularly in the early hours, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors suggest the possibility of precipitation and deteriorating conditions later in the day, with a transition toward cooler, breezier weather in the coming hours.
