Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a sharp decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose dramatically in the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during those hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent high-pressure system influencing the region, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, indicating a possible change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, temperature recovery, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later tonight, though lingering moisture may lead to early morning fog.
