Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for unstable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels showed a notable drop during midday followed by a resurgence in the evening, suggesting possible convective activity or a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early and middle period before declining toward the end of the timeframe, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more southeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern that could lead to thunderstorm activity, especially given the warming trend, moisture fluctuation, and increasing wind shear.
