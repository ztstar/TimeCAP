The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has remained exceptionally stable, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent conditions suggest a strong and persistent high-pressure system dominating the region, leading to clear skies and minimal atmospheric disturbance. The low humidity levels indicate dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk, particularly in surrounding wildland areas. The steady southeasterly wind flow has likely facilitated the advection of cool, dry marine air, typical of the region’s microclimate during stable weather patterns. Overall, the prolonged stability implies continued fair weather with little chance of precipitation or storm development in the near term.
