Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight period, peaking in the early hours, then steadily declined as temperatures rose, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, with a brief increase followed by a gradual decrease, suggesting a weak, transient high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions around dawn, followed by a moderate increase in the late afternoon, likely due to daytime heating and local circulation changes. Wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and then southerly again, reflecting changing air mass patterns, potentially signaling a transition in weather dynamics.
