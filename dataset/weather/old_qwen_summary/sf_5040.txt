Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night, particularly during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the temperature drop. A significant increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with calm or light winds, but returned with increased strength in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, signaling a shift in circulation. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and stronger winds suggests a transition from a cool, foggy period to a drier, clearer afternoon and evening, typical of San Francisco’s coastal microclimate.
