Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sustained high-pressure buildup in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds increased markedly during the middle of the day and again in the late evening, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with coastal breezes influenced by the marine layer. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a cool, moist, and breezy coastal environment toward a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer regime, typical of a late-afternoon to evening clearing period in the region.
