Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early hours, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds and a high potential for precipitation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a gradual rise, hinting at the passage of a weather system, possibly associated with a cold front. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the southeast to south-southwest, which may have contributed to the mixing of moist air and enhanced storm development. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and persistent wind flow points to a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity, particularly in the late evening and overnight hours.
