Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicating a clear nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the formation of fog or mist, particularly during the late night and early morning. Air pressure showed a sustained drop, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, aligning with the movement of the approaching front. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the late evening suggests the influence of a developing storm system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
