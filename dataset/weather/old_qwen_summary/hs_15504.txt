Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure steadily increased through the night into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, possibly indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing surface boundary. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more variable daytime regime, with potential for isolated showers if moisture persists.
