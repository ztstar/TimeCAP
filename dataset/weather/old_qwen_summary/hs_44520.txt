Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, reducing visibility and creating a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before gradually declining, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions overnight. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions that point to changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight period to a more active, potentially storm-prone atmosphere in the coming hours.
