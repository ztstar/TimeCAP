Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline after midnight, suggesting dry air infiltration, likely associated with the arrival of a high-pressure system. Air pressure dropped dramatically in the early hours before rebounding sharply, signaling the passage of a strong low-pressure system, which also brought gusty winds. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, particularly from the northwest, before tapering off in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic weather transition, with the city likely emerging from a period of unstable, stormy weather into a more stable, cooler, and drier regime.
