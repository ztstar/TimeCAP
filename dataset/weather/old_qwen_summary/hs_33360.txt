Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more westerly and then to easterly directions, with a notable increase in speed during the late night and early morning, possibly indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition in weather conditions, with increased moisture and weakening pressure potentially setting the stage for unstable weather or precipitation later in the day.
