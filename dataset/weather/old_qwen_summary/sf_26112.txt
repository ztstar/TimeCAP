Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, alternating between high and low values, indicating fluctuating air masses, with a significant surge in moisture during the early morning hours. Air pressure rose sharply in the late afternoon and evening, peaking before a sudden drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front or the influence of shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds exhibited extreme variability, with a brief but intense spike late in the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to an active and dynamic weather system, likely contributing to coastal fog formation and variable conditions across the region.
