Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog formation or persistent damp conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained relatively low, with consistent direction shifts from southeast to southwest and later northwest, implying changing air mass influences. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, though lingering moisture may still support isolated showers or fog during early mornings.
