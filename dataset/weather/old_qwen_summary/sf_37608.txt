Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent marine layer influence, which diminished significantly in the late afternoon. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a slight recovery later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in airflow, likely due to the breakdown of the marine layer. These conditions suggest a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a drier, windier regime, which may lead to clearer skies and more stable conditions overnight.
