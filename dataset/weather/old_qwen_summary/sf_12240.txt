Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating stable moisture levels, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure peaked in the early morning and remained elevated before dropping sharply in the late evening, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a notable lull around dawn, but increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, especially from the northeast and northwest sectors. These conditions point to a transition period where maritime influence remains strong, with potential for patchy fog and cooler temperatures in the coming hours as the low-pressure system begins to affect the region.
