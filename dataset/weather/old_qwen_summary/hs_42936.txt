Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable shift in humidity, with elevated levels early in the period followed by a significant drop, then a return to high moisture conditions, suggesting possible precipitation events and subsequent clearing. Temperature trends revealed a gradual warming throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, indicating a buildup of heat likely exacerbated by high humidity. Air pressure fluctuated noticeably, with a marked increase midday and sustained higher readings in the evening, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind patterns displayed variability, with stronger gusts in the early and late hours, particularly from the southeast and east sectors, which may have contributed to the movement of moist air and storm development. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather regime, potentially leading to afternoon thunderstorms and a transition toward more stable, warmer conditions in the near term.
