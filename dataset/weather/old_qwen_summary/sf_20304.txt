Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests persistent fog and low cloud cover, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend in the final hours, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly associated with an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light and consistent, with a subtle shift in direction from the northeast to the southeast, hinting at changing synoptic conditions. These conditions collectively point to a stable marine layer with high moisture content, likely maintaining overcast skies and cool temperatures, which may persist into the coming hours.
