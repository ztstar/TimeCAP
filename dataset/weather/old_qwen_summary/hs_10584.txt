Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak just before midday, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with consistent northeasterly and easterly flow during the night and early morning, transitioning to more variable directions in the afternoon, possibly due to local thermal effects. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns indicates a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions, likely leading to a drier and more comfortable environment in the coming hours.
