Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable pressure increase occurred in the late afternoon, culminating in a sharp spike that may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief intensification in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, possibly indicating a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a moist, stable night into a drier, more stable afternoon, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge that typically brings pleasant weather to the region.
