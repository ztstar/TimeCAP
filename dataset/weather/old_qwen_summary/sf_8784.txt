Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, coinciding with increasing humidity and strong, shifting winds from the northwest and west, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. The wind speed peaked in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly during the mid-afternoon, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching a peak before declining in the afternoon as winds strengthened and temperatures climbed, suggesting clearing skies and improved air mixing. Overall, the data reflects the influence of a maritime air mass transitioning through the region, with implications for fog development overnight and potentially clearer conditions by midday.
