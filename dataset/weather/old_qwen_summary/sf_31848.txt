Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before a sharp decline, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or a clearing of fog. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, weakening in the midday hours before increasing again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and then southeast. These combined trends point to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge, likely leading to improved visibility and drier, more stable weather conditions in the coming hours.
