Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at near saturation and remaining elevated through the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level stratus clouds. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to stable, clear conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a brief surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic atmospheric adjustments, possibly linked to coastal breezes or topographic influences. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, fog-prone night to a progressively clearer and more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
