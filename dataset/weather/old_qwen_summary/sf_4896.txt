Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, promoting stable and clearing conditions. Wind speed was minimal during the overnight hours, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by shifting wind patterns and coastal dynamics. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly and then back to westerly suggests evolving synoptic influences, potentially signaling a transition in local weather patterns.
