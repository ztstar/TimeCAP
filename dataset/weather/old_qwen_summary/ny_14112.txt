Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked fluctuation, peaking in the early hours and then declining sharply, indicating a shift toward drier air conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low initially but intensified in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from varied directions, hinting at dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely resulting in improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
