Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity remained high during the early morning hours, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sharp rise followed by a brief drop, indicating possible changes in atmospheric stability and the influence of shifting weather systems. Wind speeds showed marked variability, with a strong gust in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, which may signal an approaching frontal passage.
