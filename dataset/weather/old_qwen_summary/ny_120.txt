Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, indicating an approaching low-pressure system, which correlates with the observed increase in wind speed and shifting wind direction. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal boundary. The combination of dropping pressure, rising humidity, and strong winds points to an active weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
