Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual upward trend, indicating a cooling night followed by warming conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the overnight hours, particularly from the southwest, aligning with the rising humidity and falling pressure, consistent with storm system influence. The shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest in the late afternoon, combined with the drop in humidity and pressure recovery, suggests the system is moving out, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions.
