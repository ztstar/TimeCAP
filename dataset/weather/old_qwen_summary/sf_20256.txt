Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a marked decrease during the afternoon. Air pressure showed a continuous downward trend, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning and remained elevated, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more southerly and easterly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These combined factors point to the arrival of a maritime air mass influence, likely leading to overcast conditions and a heightened chance of light rain or fog in the coming hours.
