Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, reaching saturated conditions, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, pointing to the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning but increased notably in the afternoon, with shifting wind directions indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly due to local thermal effects or frontal influences. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and variable wind patterns may elevate the risk of localized thunderstorms later in the day, especially if instability develops.
