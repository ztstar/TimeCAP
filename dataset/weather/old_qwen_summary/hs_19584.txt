Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady increase in humidity, reaching saturation levels and remaining at 100% for the final 12 hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle. Temperature trends showed a gradual decline through the night, followed by a slight recovery in the early morning, suggesting a stabilizing boundary layer. Air pressure rose significantly toward the end of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a notable calm period around dawn, followed by a gradual increase in the morning, likely due to the development of a surface-level pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a change in air mass, possibly indicating the influence of a passing frontal boundary.
