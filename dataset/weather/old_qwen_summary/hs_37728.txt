Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, which remained near saturation levels during the early morning and midday hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or overcast conditions. Temperatures showed a gradual increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the last 12 hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring increased storm activity. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and south, potentially indicating the onset of a frontal boundary or thunderstorm development. Combined with shifting wind directions and a drop in pressure, these trends suggest a high probability of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
