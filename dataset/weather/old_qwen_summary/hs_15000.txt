Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, reflecting overnight moisture accumulation, and gradually declined through the day as temperatures increased, suggesting increasing air stability. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the early hours, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which may indicate the passage of a high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds were minimal overnight and increased during the afternoon, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more easterly direction, potentially signaling a change in air mass or frontal dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm development.
