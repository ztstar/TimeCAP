Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night, indicating a strong influence of marine air intrusion typical of coastal fog formation. Air pressure remained consistently high and stable, suggesting the presence of a strong high-pressure system that has been suppressing storm development and maintaining clear skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and southeasterly, consistent with a landward flow that can enhance fog advection. These conditions together point to a classic coastal fog event, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a cool, damp feel across the city, especially in low-lying and coastal areas.
