Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of stable air pressure, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a relatively undisturbed atmospheric environment. Temperatures showed a consistent drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise through the afternoon, suggesting a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime heating. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, which may signal the dissipation of nocturnal moisture. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a steady shift in wind direction from the south to the west-southwest, pointing to a change in air mass or the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. These patterns collectively suggest the approach of a drier, warmer air mass, potentially reducing the likelihood of precipitation but increasing the risk of heat accumulation during the day.
