Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early morning hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather front or a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift toward more southerly to easterly directions, indicating potential inflow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined patterns point to an active atmospheric transition, with the potential for unstable conditions and isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
