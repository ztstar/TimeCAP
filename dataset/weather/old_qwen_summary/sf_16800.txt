Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting no major weather system changes, but a slight dip toward the end may hint at an approaching shift in conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with consistent easterly to southerly winds early on, gradually shifting to stronger westerly flow by late evening—consistent with typical coastal wind patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind direction suggests a persistent marine layer, likely resulting in foggy conditions, particularly in the early hours, which may continue into the coming morning.
