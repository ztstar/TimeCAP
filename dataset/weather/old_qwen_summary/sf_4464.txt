Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nocturnal temperature drop succeeded by morning recovery. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with prolonged saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, followed by a sharp decline during the afternoon, likely due to clearing skies and increased solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the early morning, which may reflect the influence of a high-pressure system bringing drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening and overnight, with gusts from the west and southwest, contributing to the dissipation of fog and promoting air mixing. The shift in wind direction from maritime to more onshore and then to variable patterns hints at dynamic boundary layer adjustments, potentially signaling a transition in local weather patterns.
