Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend that could reduce the risk of precipitation later. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased in the early morning hours, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, likely contributing to the movement of moist air inland. The shift in wind direction toward west and northwest in the late evening may indicate the approach of a drier air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and improved conditions by morning.
