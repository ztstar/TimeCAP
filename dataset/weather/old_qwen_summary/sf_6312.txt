Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from night-time radiative cooling to daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early hours, followed by a sharp rise and sustained high readings later in the day, implying the passage of a weather front, likely associated with a high-pressure system building in. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief increase in the early morning and a shift toward more variable directions, including strong southerly and westerly flow, which may have contributed to the advection of marine air. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and consistent wind from the west-southwest points to a persistent marine layer, increasing the likelihood of foggy or overcast conditions through the day.
