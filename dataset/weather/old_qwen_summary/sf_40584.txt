Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually warming again in the afternoon, indicating a strong marine influence. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of coastal inversions. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a recovery and stabilization, which may correlate with the passage of a weak frontal system or shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east, likely driven by a coastal breeze or thermal gradient, contributing to the dispersal of fog. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then to the northwest suggests a dynamic change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling a transition in weather conditions.
