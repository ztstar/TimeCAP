Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating the arrival of a warmer air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking during the late night and early morning, likely contributing to fog or mist formation, before dropping sharply during the day as air warmed. Air pressure remained relatively stable until late evening, when a slight decline occurred, signaling potential changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and eventually southeasterly, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more unstable conditions, possibly increasing the likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
