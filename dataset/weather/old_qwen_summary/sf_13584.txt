Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-morning hours. Humidity levels remained high during the early part of the period, then sharply declined in the afternoon before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or the influence of coastal fog dissipation. Air pressure rose steadily through the early hours, peaked in the midday, and then dropped notably in the final hours, indicating the passage of a weather system that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon and overnight, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a maritime air mass, potentially bringing cooler, drier air and influencing coastal fog dynamics in the coming hours.
