Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels increased significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking around dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, reaching its lowest point in the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and overnight hours, with strong, variable winds from the southwest and west, consistent with frontal passage. These combined trends point to a developing storm system, likely bringing precipitation and possibly gusty conditions in the near term.
