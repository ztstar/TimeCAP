Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which are typical in the region during coastal inversions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a prolonged period of low pressure, which may indicate the passage of a weather system bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds diminished to near-zero during the early hours, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, consistent with calm conditions often associated with fog formation, while a sudden increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction later in the day suggest a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to an active coastal weather regime, likely involving marine layer development and potential fog persistence into the morning hours.
