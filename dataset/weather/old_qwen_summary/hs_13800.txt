Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased steadily after midnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually decreasing, indicating a moistening of the lower atmosphere during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reaching its highest point in the late afternoon before leveling off, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a slight intensification in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a gradual shift in wind direction from northwesterly to more southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition toward more stable, drier conditions later in the day, with reduced potential for convective activity.
