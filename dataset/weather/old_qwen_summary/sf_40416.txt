Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which then stabilized and slightly rose in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and eventually easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends point to a transitional weather phase, possibly bringing clearer conditions and stronger onshore winds later in the day.
