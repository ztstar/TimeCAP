Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually recovering. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking and remaining consistently high, indicating moisture accumulation and potential for fog or drizzle. A steady decline in air pressure, particularly from mid-evening onward, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that reflect changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern likely to result in overcast conditions and possible precipitation in the near term.
