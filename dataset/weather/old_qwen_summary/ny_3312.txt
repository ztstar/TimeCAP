Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing at lower levels. Humidity levels showed marked variability, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses and possible precipitation. A gradual decrease in atmospheric pressure throughout the evening indicates an approaching low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions later. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift from southerly to northerly and then easterly directions, signaling a change in circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the onset of a colder, potentially stormy weather regime affecting New York City.
