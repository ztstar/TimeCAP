Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the early hours before dropping slightly during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of moist air masses. Air pressure showed a significant decline in the late evening and early morning, followed by a gradual rise, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, likely associated with the intensifying pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast, combined with rising wind speeds and pressure changes, indicates dynamic atmospheric conditions that could lead to unsettled weather, including potential precipitation, in the near term.
