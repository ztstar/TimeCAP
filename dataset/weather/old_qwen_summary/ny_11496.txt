Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high during the early hours, spiked significantly overnight, then sharply declined in the mid-morning before returning to elevated levels, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation followed by clearing. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the morning and midday, peaking in the afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a notable increase in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, increasing temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day.
