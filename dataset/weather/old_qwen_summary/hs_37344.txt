Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially during nighttime and early morning, suggesting potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, coinciding with increased wind activity, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system. Wind patterns were variable, with shifts in direction and intermittent increases in speed, particularly in the mid-to-late night, indicating possible boundary layer mixing or frontal influence. The combination of rising temperature, high humidity, and falling pressure suggests a high likelihood of unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the potential for isolated showers or thunderstorms in the coming hours.
