Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly later in the day. Humidity levels showed a pronounced fluctuation, peaking during the night and early morning before declining in the afternoon, indicating possible moisture changes linked to shifting air masses. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly directions, accompanied by a notable increase in speed during the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the potential for improved conditions following a cooler, more humid night and an active wind shift suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics.
