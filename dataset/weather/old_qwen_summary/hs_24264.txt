Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility and increased the perceived discomfort. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a weather system, possibly a front, that brought in more stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a brief increase in the early morning and again in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing air mass influences. Combined, these patterns point to a dynamic weather transition, with potential for developing storms or scattered showers in the near term, particularly as warm, moist air continues to build during the day.
