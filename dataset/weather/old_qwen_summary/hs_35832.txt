Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dipping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near or at saturation during the overnight hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly around dawn. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, suggesting a change in air mass flow that may influence local weather stability. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and decreasing wind activity points to a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions, although residual moisture may delay full drying until later in the day.
