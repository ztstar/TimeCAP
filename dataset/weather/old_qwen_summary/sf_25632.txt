Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region during this time of year. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a recovery later in the evening, indicating possible passage of a weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning hours, with sustained gusts from the northwest, which likely contributed to the cooling and increased humidity. The wind direction shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from westerly to southerly and then northeasterly, signaling a dynamic change in local airflow patterns that may influence coastal fog development and temperature distribution.
