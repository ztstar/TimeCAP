Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual rise during the afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked oscillations, peaking during early morning hours and remaining elevated in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, indicating persistent fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure exhibited a pattern of fluctuating highs and lows, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of a coastal front or changing pressure gradient. These combined factors point toward a transition in weather conditions, likely bringing cooler, windier, and more overcast conditions to the region.
