Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating a significant moisture buildup, which likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity, though a slight rise in the afternoon may signal improving conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and into the evening, with a consistent shift in wind direction from northwest to nearly north, indicating a strengthening onshore flow. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and persistent onshore winds points to a clearing trend, likely bringing improved visibility and more stable conditions by late evening.
