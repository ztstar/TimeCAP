Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a slight warming in the final hours, indicating a dynamic thermal environment. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the evening, which often signals the approach of a weather system, potentially including precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to easterly and then to northerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with a developing frontal system. The combination of dropping pressure, rising humidity, and variable wind direction strongly suggests the potential for showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
