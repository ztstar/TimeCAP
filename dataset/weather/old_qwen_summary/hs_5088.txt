Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking and then stabilizing, which may signal the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds remained minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing between midnight and early morning, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, likely due to boundary layer mixing and pressure gradient changes. Wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to easterly and then to more northerly sectors, indicating a change in airflow associated with the approaching high-pressure system and potential clearing of skies.
