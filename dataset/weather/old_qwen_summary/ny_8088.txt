Temperature showed a steady increase during the day, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to decline, indicating a warming trend followed by cooling. Humidity decreased significantly in the afternoon, dropping to much lower levels, which suggests drier air and reduced cloud formation. Air pressure dropped sharply in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the same period, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined changes imply a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with the possibility of precipitation and gusty winds in the coming hours.
