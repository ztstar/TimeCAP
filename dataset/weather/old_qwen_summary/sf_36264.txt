Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning hours, suggesting fog formation or marine layer persistence, before declining significantly during the afternoon as air warmed and the layer broke up. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a westerly to southwesterly direction, consistent with typical offshore flow patterns that can accelerate the dissipation of fog. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy morning to a warmer, clearer afternoon, typical of the region’s microclimatic behavior.
