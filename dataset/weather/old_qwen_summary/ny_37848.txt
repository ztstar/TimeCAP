Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual rise, indicating a warming trend from early morning through the afternoon, with the coolest readings in the pre-dawn hours. Humidity levels exhibited a significant drop during the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a notable increase in wind speed, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass. A sustained decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning points to an approaching low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined trends suggest the city experienced a transition from a stable, humid environment to a more turbulent, drying phase—potentially signaling the onset of a storm or a change in weather patterns.
