Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early hours, dropping significantly as the day progressed, indicating a drying trend likely due to increasing temperatures and shifting wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions.
