Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by prolonged solar exposure and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels showed a distinct pattern, peaking in the early morning hours and declining significantly through the day, which suggests a transition from a more stable, moist air mass to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during midday, followed by a sharp increase in the evening, signaling the passage of a weather front that may have brought temporary clearing and improved conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light, southerly flows in the morning to more vigorous, southerly to easterly winds in the afternoon and evening, consistent with a developing low-pressure system influencing the region. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and changing wind directions points to an increased risk of heat stress and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, especially if instability continues to build.
