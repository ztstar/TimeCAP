Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass. A sustained drop in air pressure during the midday and early evening indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day or overnight, particularly with the return of higher humidity and increasing instability.
