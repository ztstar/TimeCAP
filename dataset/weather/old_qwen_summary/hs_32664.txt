Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct two-phase pattern: a cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation levels, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover during the early hours. A significant pressure increase occurred in the mid-morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were generally light and variable during the night, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a changing influence of regional airflows. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime regime, typical of a developing high-pressure ridge over the region.
