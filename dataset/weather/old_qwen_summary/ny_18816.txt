Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating the influence of a strong cold front. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, rising significantly during early morning hours before plummeting in the mid-afternoon, followed by a resurgence in the evening—suggesting a mix of moist air advection and subsequent drying. Air pressure exhibited a progressive increase, peaking sharply in the late evening, which is characteristic of an approaching high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a notable increase in the early afternoon and a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with the passage of a cold front. The combination of dropping temperatures, rising pressure, and changing wind patterns points to a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable weather, likely resulting in clear skies and improved air quality in the city.
