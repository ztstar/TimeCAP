Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night into a milder day. Humidity levels started high and remained elevated through the night, peaking at saturation before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady increase during the night, culminating in a peak just before dawn, followed by a slight decline, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system or a change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the early morning hours and again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns possibly linked to local topography or synoptic influences. These combined factors suggest the city has transitioned from a fog-prone, cool, and stable nocturnal environment to a drier, windier, and more variable daytime regime, with potential implications for visibility, outdoor conditions, and air quality.
