Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the early morning. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A sharp rise in wind speed occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, suggesting the influence of a coastal breeze or approaching atmospheric disturbance. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a peak in the early morning followed by a sustained drop, signaling possible changes in weather systems approaching the region. These combined indicators point to a dynamic coastal transition, with conditions favorable for foggy mornings and a potential shift toward more variable or unsettled weather later in the day.
