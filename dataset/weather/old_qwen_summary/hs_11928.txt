Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a sustained increase from mid-morning through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a shift in direction from northerly to easterly and then southerly, implying a change in airflow associated with the approaching weather pattern. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, humid, and potentially overcast night toward a warmer, drier, and more stable day, with diminishing chances of precipitation.
