Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting a transition from dry to more moist conditions, which may support the development of localized convective activity. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system influencing the area, which generally brings stable and clear skies. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a shift toward more variable and stronger winds in the afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a possible shift in airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a drying trend following a period of increased moisture and stability, with potential for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient lift is introduced.
