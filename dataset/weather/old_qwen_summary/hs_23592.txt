Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before moderating slightly, indicating a moist air mass persisting near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a notable rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east-northeast, pointing to a developing circulation pattern. These conditions collectively suggest the approach of a more stable, drier air mass, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms while bringing cooler, settled weather in the coming hours.
