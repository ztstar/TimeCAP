Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss and increasing moisture. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which suggests the presence of a moist, stable air mass conducive to fog or drizzle formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, reaching a low point in the early hours before beginning to rise slightly, signaling the possible passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted dramatically from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly direction, with increasing wind speeds in the late evening, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that may precede a shift in weather conditions. These combined factors point to a transition phase in Houston’s weather, potentially leading to unstable conditions, with an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy showers if sufficient lift is introduced.
