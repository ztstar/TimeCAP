Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a marked decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cold overnight period to a gradually warming day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase in the early morning and again in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture buildup and potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather.
