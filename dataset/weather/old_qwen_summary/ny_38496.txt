Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels began moderately high but declined significantly through the day, suggesting drier air conditions in the later hours. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, with a notable drop in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with more variable and stronger gusts later in the day, consistent with shifting weather patterns. Wind directions shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the south-southwest, reinforcing the influence of an approaching frontal system that may bring precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
