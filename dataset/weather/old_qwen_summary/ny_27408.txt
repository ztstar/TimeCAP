Temperature showed a gradual increase throughout the day, indicating a warming trend from early morning into the afternoon, followed by a slight decline in the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to overnight condensation or air mass changes. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the evening, particularly during the final hours, with a shift in direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, indicating changing airflow patterns associated with the advancing system. Collectively, these trends point to the onset of a dynamic weather event, potentially including precipitation or gusty conditions in the near term.
