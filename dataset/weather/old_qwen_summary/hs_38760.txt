Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, culminating in near-saturation conditions during the early morning, which increases the likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable weather and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east sectors, potentially signaling the onset of a storm system. Combined, these indicators suggest a high probability of thunderstorm development, especially during the overnight hours, due to the convergence of warm, moist air and dynamic atmospheric instability.
