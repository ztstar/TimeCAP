Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with gusts from the northwest and northeast, likely contributing to the cooling effect and dispersal of moisture. The shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly and then to northerly patterns indicates changing air mass dynamics, which may portend a transition to colder, drier air in the coming hours.
