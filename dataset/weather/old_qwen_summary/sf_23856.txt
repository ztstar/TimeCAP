Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal climate dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the development of fog or low stratus clouds, consistent with common marine layer conditions in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decline in the late evening, hinting at a possible weakening of high-pressure dominance and potential for increased cloud cover or light precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from a strong southwesterly flow overnight to a more easterly direction by morning, reflecting the influence of the marine layer and sea breeze circulation. These combined factors point to a persistent marine layer, with foggy conditions likely in the early hours and a gradual clearing trend expected as temperatures rise and winds shift.
