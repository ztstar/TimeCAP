Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near saturation, indicating the likelihood of fog or low-lying clouds, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a brief spike followed by sustained lower values, suggesting the passage of a weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by coastal upwelling or a sea breeze system. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, shifting wind patterns, and pressure changes—point to the presence of a marine layer, consistent with typical coastal fog and cool conditions in the region.
