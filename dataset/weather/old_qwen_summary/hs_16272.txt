Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual回暖, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime warming. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup followed by a drying trend. Air pressure showed a slight decline overall, with a notable drop in the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more westerly and then northerly directions, reflecting changing air flow dynamics, possibly linked to a developing synoptic-scale disturbance. These combined factors point to a transition period with increasing instability, raising the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
