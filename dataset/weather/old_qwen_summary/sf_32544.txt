Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is common in the region during the transitional season. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, reaching a low point just before midday, indicating an approaching weather system that may influence conditions in the coming hours. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with stronger gusts observed in the late afternoon, likely due to the development of a sea breeze or localized pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly patterns reflects changing atmospheric dynamics, potentially signaling the passage of a front that could bring further shifts in temperature and cloud cover.
