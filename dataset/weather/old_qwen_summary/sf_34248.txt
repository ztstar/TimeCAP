Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping slightly during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and possible fog development. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, peaking in the late morning and early afternoon, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure ridge contributing to stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during early morning and evening hours, with a shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest during the night, consistent with onshore flow and coastal breeze patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and persistent onshore winds points to the likelihood of fog formation or persistence, particularly near the coast and in low-lying areas.
