Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the day, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. A sharp decline in air pressure occurred around midnight, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds were subdued during the overnight hours, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, consistent with changing airflow patterns associated with the low-pressure event. These combined conditions point to a dynamic atmospheric shift, potentially leading to continued overcast skies and a chance of light precipitation as the system moves through the region.
