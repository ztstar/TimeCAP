Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which suggests favorable conditions for fog or drizzle, especially during the overnight period. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and later from the south-southeast, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined trends point to a transition in weather, likely resulting in overcast skies and a heightened chance of rain in the near term.
