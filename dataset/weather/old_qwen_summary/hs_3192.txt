Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise, indicating a transition from cooler to more stable conditions. Humidity levels showed a distinct pattern, rising sharply in the early morning before plummeting midday, then rebounding significantly in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system or localized convection. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late evening, which is indicative of approaching high-pressure dominance and generally fair weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, hinting at the development of a low-level circulation or a moisture influx from the Gulf. These combined trends suggest a dynamic shift in Houston’s weather, with potential for thunderstorm development later in the evening due to the convergence of moist, unstable air and increasing wind shear.
