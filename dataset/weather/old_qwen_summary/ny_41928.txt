Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects the onset of a daytime heating cycle. Humidity levels remained near saturation early in the period before dropping significantly, suggesting a transition from a saturated, possibly foggy or drizzly morning to drier, clearer conditions later in the day. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing weather, potentially including precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening and overnight, with gusts reaching higher intensities, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly, consistent with storm development or frontal movement. These combined trends suggest that New York City is experiencing a shift toward unsettled weather, with potential for rain or storms in the near term.
