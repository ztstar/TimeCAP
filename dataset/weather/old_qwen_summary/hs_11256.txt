Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before plummeting during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to dry, sun-driven surface heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light except for a brief increase in the late evening, accompanied by a marked shift in wind direction from northeast to southwest, which may indicate the influence of a developing boundary or weak frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for increasing instability and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
