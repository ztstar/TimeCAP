Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise slightly, signaling the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, likely driven by a developing surface convergence. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the final hours may point to an influx of moist, unstable air—raising the possibility of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
