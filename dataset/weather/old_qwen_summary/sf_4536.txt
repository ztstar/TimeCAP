Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the night, coinciding with a sharp increase in wind speed and a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Wind speeds remained elevated through the night and into the early morning, with gusts exceeding previous levels, suggesting strong synoptic-scale forcing. These conditions point to a dynamic weather transition, with the city likely experiencing foggy, breezy conditions overnight and improving, though potentially unsettled, conditions in the coming hours.
