Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that likely reflects the influence of a shifting air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early and late hours, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring increased cloud cover and precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the latter half of the day, particularly in the evening and night, with a prevailing southerly to easterly direction, enhancing moisture transport into the region. Combined, these conditions point to a developing weather pattern conducive to overcast skies and a heightened chance of thunderstorms, especially during the overnight hours.
