Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a notable decrease in wind speed, signaling the passage of a weather front. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to northerly and then to easterly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow, possibly linked to a low-pressure system approaching the region. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable winds points to the likelihood of foggy conditions and a potential for light precipitation later in the day.
