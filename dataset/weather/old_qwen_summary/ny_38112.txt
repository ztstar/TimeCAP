Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and peaked in the late afternoon before slightly cooling. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early and middle hours, with a notable increase in the late night and early morning, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds as the air cooled. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the early evening before stabilizing, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west, likely contributing to the mixing of air masses and the dispersion of moisture. Overall, the data suggests a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, with the possibility of light winds and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
