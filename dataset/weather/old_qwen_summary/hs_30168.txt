Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a nighttime temperature inversion that likely trapped moisture near the surface. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching near saturation, which suggests conditions favorable for fog or mist formation in the early hours. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, with a notable dip before rebounding in the late afternoon—indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to southeasterly during the night, then veered to a more westerly direction by midday, consistent with changing airflow associated with the approaching low. These combined factors point to a transition period bringing increased cloud cover and a higher likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
