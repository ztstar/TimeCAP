Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours was followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from a cooler nighttime period into a developing daytime heating phase. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, then declined significantly during the midday, indicating a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. A consistent pattern of falling air pressure in the early hours, followed by stabilization and slight fluctuations, points to the influence of a passing weather front, possibly associated with changing wind dynamics. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast, aligning with a shift in wind direction that may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. These combined trends suggest the potential for unsettled conditions later in the day, including possible precipitation, as the atmosphere continues to adjust to the dynamic pressure and wind changes.
