Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable nighttime period to a developing daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching saturation by early morning and remaining high until midday, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to condensation and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late morning and early afternoon, peaking just before a sudden drop in the evening, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, with a change in direction from southeasterly to northerly and a rise in speed, indicating a possible frontal passage or local circulation change. These dynamics point to a complex weather transition, with high moisture and fluctuating pressure increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms or heavy showers in the coming hours.
