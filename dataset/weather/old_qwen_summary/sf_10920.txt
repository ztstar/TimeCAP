Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with brief periods of very low humidity interspersed with sudden spikes, suggesting possible localized fog or rapid evaporation events. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline toward the end of the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with notable calm periods and a brief increase in intensity during the early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially signaling the arrival of more unstable or maritime-influenced air, which may lead to fog, overcast skies, or light precipitation later in the day.
