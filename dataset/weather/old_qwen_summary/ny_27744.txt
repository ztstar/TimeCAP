Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and a strong likelihood of fog or drizzle, especially during the early hours. Air pressure showed a significant decline, with a sustained drop reaching a low point in the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind patterns exhibited a shift from light, variable directions in the early period to stronger, more consistent southerly and westerly flows later, likely transporting moist air inland. These combined factors point to a developing weather event, most likely precipitation, with possible fog and overcast conditions continuing into the near term.
