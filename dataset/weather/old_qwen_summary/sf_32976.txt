Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during midday, suggesting a reduction in fog or marine layer presence, which was later re-established with a resurgence of high moisture in the evening. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and early afternoon, peaking before a sharp decline in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and northerly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest the influence of a coastal upwelling event or a passing frontal boundary, contributing to variable and potentially unsettled weather in the region.
