Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating strong moisture presence in the atmosphere. A notable drop in temperature occurred in the pre-dawn hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal heating after a cool, moist night. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early evening, with a peak from the northwest, followed by a calm period and a resurgence of winds from the southwest in the late night, signaling shifting atmospheric circulation. Air pressure remained stable overall, with a brief dip late in the cycle that may have coincided with the arrival of a weak frontal influence. The combination of high humidity, variable wind patterns, and temperature fluctuations points to the presence of a marine layer with possible fog development and potential for coastal stratus clouds, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
