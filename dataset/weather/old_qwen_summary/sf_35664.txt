Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early hours, remaining extremely high throughout the night and into the morning before beginning to decline. Air pressure showed a slight fluctuation, peaking in the early morning and then gradually decreasing, which may indicate a weakening high-pressure system. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but picked up significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly sectors. These conditions suggest the arrival of a maritime air mass, likely contributing to foggy and cool conditions, with a potential for clearing skies later in the day as wind patterns stabilize.
