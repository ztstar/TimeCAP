Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of dense fog or low clouds, which likely suppressed temperature increases. A significant drop in air pressure in the early morning was followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front and a shift toward drier, more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, which may indicate the onset of a change in regional airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy marine layer to a drier, windier regime—consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
