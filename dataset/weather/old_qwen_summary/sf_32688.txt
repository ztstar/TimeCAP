Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping sharply during mid-morning before rebounding to near saturation by late night, indicating possible fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure showed a significant spike in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, consistent with a change in prevailing flow associated with the high-pressure build-up. These patterns suggest a transition from a maritime-influenced, fog-prone condition to a drier, more stable regime, characteristic of a typical San Francisco afternoon transition.
