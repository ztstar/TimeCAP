Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a recovery later in the day, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with gusts from the northeast and northwest, possibly enhancing coastal mixing and fog formation. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the afternoon suggests a change in air mass, potentially bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions as the day progressed.
