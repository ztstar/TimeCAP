Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased across the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light but showed a slight increase during the early morning hours, with wind direction shifting from the northwest to the west-southwest, consistent with a changing flow around the high-pressure ridge. These trends collectively point to a transitioning weather pattern, with improving conditions and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
