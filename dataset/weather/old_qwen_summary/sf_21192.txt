Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high through mid-morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level stratus clouds common in the region. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind speeds later in the day. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors by late afternoon, indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and moist maritime environment toward a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer regime, consistent with the typical afternoon clearing seen in San Francisco’s microclimate.
