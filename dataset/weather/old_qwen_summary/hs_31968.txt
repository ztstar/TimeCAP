Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply in the midday, indicating a possible transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a brief rise before falling again, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns point to the arrival of a dynamic weather front, increasing the likelihood of scattered thunderstorms or rain later in the day.
