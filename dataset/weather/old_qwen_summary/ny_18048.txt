Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend through the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a gradual increase through the early to midday hours, followed by a slight decline in the late evening, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with notable increases in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition period in the weather, potentially leading to more unstable conditions later in the day.
