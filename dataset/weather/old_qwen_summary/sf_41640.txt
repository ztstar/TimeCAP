Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low stratus clouds. A notable pressure dip occurred in the late night, followed by a rapid rebound, signaling the passage of a weather front, likely associated with a shift in wind patterns and the onset of more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the west and southwest, which likely contributed to the cooling and fog formation. The change in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly suggests a dynamic shift in airflow, potentially linked to a coastal upwelling event or a synoptic-scale pressure gradient.
