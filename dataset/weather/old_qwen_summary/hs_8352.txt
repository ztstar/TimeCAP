Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night, particularly in the early hours, indicating high moisture content that likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. A notable pressure spike occurred in the late evening, followed by a rapid decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought brief precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, with increasing speeds in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the arrival of a new airstream. These combined factors suggest a dynamic atmospheric transition, possibly leading to unstable conditions and scattered thunderstorms in the coming hours.
