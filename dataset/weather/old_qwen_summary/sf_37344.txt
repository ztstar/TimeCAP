Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. A prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, particularly in the pre-dawn and early morning hours, suggests strong marine influence and likely fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a declining pattern through the night, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system associated with unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the morning, with consistent gusts from the northwest and west, reinforcing the onshore flow typical of coastal fog events. The shift in wind direction toward the south and east in the late afternoon may signal a change in atmospheric dynamics, potentially leading to clearing skies and improved visibility.
