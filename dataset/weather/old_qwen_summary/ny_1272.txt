Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a prolonged period of cold conditions, likely influenced by a weakening warm front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A consistent drop in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing precipitation. Wind activity intensified in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast, indicating dynamic atmospheric changes. The shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly followed by a surge from the south-southeast aligns with the development of a frontal passage, signaling an increased likelihood of storms or sustained rain in the coming hours.
