Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at near-saturation levels, which is characteristic of marine layer conditions common in the region. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the night and early morning, with near-zero values indicating calm conditions, likely contributing to fog formation and accumulation. The wind direction shifted dramatically in the late afternoon and evening, transitioning from southwest to more variable and easterly patterns, which may signal the onset of a change in air mass or the breakdown of the marine layer.
