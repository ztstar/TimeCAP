Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and sunlight. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which is typical of marine layer development, and then declined as the day progressed, suggesting fog dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase over time, reflecting a stable high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm activity. Wind speeds decreased through the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from west to southwest, indicating a change in flow that may be related to a weakening of the marine layer. These conditions collectively suggest a typical coastal weather pattern, with foggy mornings giving way to clearer, milder afternoons, consistent with San Francisco’s Mediterranean climate.
