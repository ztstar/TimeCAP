Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, with a brief dip in the midday hours before rebounding, indicating persistent moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a slight decline overnight, stabilizing around mid-morning and suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early to mid-morning, with strong, southerly to westerly gusts, then diminished through the afternoon, aligning with a weakening of offshore flow. The shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest in the late evening suggests a possible change in atmospheric circulation, potentially signaling the onset of more stable or marine-influenced conditions.
