A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise, indicating a transition from a cold night to a warming day. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during the early morning, suggesting the presence of dry air, which may have contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, which typically signals the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts in the early morning and late evening, while wind directions shifted from northerly to southerly, reflecting changing air mass influences. These trends collectively suggest a transition to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming atmosphere, likely leading to improved weather conditions in the coming hours.
