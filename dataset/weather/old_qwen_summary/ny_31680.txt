Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the west to the south and southeast, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind gusts intensified during the late evening, peaking at the end of the period, which may have contributed to scattered showers or a brief storm. The combination of rising temperatures, dropping pressure, and strong winds points to an active weather front moving through the region, potentially bringing precipitation and unstable conditions in the near term.
