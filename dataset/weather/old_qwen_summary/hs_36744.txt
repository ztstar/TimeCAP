Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking in the late evening and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation likely associated with nocturnal cooling and possible shallow convection. Air pressure steadily declined, reaching its lowest point in the early morning, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southwest, consistent with a developing weather disturbance. Combined, these trends suggest the potential for unstable conditions, including the possibility of localized showers or thunderstorms, particularly as the system continues to evolve.
