Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of a nocturnal cooling phase and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a slight stabilization, pointing to the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions prevailing at dawn, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to sea breeze development or a change in synoptic forcing. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then back to offshore suggests complex local circulation patterns, possibly driven by topography and thermal gradients, which may influence the persistence of fog and overall air quality.
