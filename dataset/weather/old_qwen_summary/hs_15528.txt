Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours and may have contributed to a muggy feel. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend throughout the period, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased substantially in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity later in the day.
