Temperature showed a gradual decline overnight, followed by a steady increase through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating. Humidity remained near saturation during the early hours, dropping significantly in the late morning and afternoon before rebounding, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or precipitation event. Air pressure exhibited a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with frontal passage. The combination of rising temperature, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns implies the onset of a dynamic weather change, potentially leading to precipitation or storm activity later in the day.
