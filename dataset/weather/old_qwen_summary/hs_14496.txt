Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to a noticeable dew point and reduced comfort. A steady high-pressure system was maintained through most of the day, reflected in stable air pressure values, though a slight drop occurred toward the end, suggesting potential for changing weather. Wind patterns showed increasing activity in the late afternoon and evening, with variable directions indicating possible atmospheric instability. These conditions point to a transition period, possibly setting the stage for a shift in weather, including potential for afternoon thunderstorms as temperatures climb and humidity remains elevated.
