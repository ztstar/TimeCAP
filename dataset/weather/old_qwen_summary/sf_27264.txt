Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A pronounced increase in air pressure during the night and early morning suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the early morning, particularly from a southerly to southeasterly direction, likely due to a shift in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. The sustained wind direction from the southeast to southwest in the afternoon, combined with the drying trend, points to the influence of offshore flow, which may have suppressed fog formation and contributed to a more stable, sunny afternoon.
