Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City experienced a significant drop during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, remaining elevated through early morning before beginning to decline, which suggests moisture accumulation associated with the cold front. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing, a classic sign of approaching or passing frontal systems. Wind speeds remained minimal during the early hours, but increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, hinting at the influence of a developing low-pressure system. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
