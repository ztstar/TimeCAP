Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling nocturnal period succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the night, then declined rapidly through the day, suggesting a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally low except for brief spikes, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing weather front. Taken together, these trends suggest that the city experienced a period of overnight cooling and high moisture, followed by a drying trend and strengthening high pressure, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies in the near term.
