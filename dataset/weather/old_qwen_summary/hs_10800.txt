Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels showed a significant spike in the overnight period, peaking before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions associated with daytime heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then began a gradual decline in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather system. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day, with only minor increases in the mid-to-late afternoon, consistent with weak synoptic forcing. Wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to more variable, including a notable northerly component in the evening, which may reflect changing atmospheric circulation patterns and a possible boundary influence.
