Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the overnight hours, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a nocturnal boundary layer stabilization or a shallow frontal influence. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds remained low during the early hours but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southerly sectors, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or showers in the near term.
