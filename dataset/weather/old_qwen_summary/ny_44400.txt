Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a general cooling trend, peaking in the early morning before steadily declining through the night and into the early afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable until the final hours, when it began to rise, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to westerly component, though directional shifts toward the north and east suggest changing wind patterns. These combined trends point to a transition period, with cooler, drier air likely moving in, potentially leading to improved visibility and more settled weather conditions in the near term.
