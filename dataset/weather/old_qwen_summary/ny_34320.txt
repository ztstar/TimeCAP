Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend likely associated with nocturnal radiative loss. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests conditions favorable for fog formation or mist. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally low, with sustained gentle breezes, limiting the dispersal of moisture and contributing to persistent damp conditions overnight. The overall pattern points to a transition from humid, stable conditions to drier, more settled weather, with potential for improved visibility and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
