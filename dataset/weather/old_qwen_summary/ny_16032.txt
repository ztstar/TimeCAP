Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖 through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during the early hours. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light through the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a moist, cooler overnight period to a drier, more stable afternoon and evening, likely resulting in improving visibility and a slight warming trend as the high-pressure system consolidates.
