Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and remaining low into the early morning before gradually rising. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the overnight hours, indicating persistent fog and low visibility, consistent with the city's typical coastal climate patterns. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early evening, followed by a sharp rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought the fog and cooler conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable during the early evening to stronger and more consistent from the west and northwest, aligning with typical marine layer dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a strong marine influence, with a stable coastal inversion likely in place, contributing to prolonged fog and cool, damp conditions.
