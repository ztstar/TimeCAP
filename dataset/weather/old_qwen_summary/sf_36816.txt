Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, though a temporary drop later in the day may indicate a shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a consistent easterly to northerly flow early in the day giving way to more variable directions later, potentially signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions combined to create a cool, damp, and stable environment early on, with a gradual transition toward drier and slightly warmer conditions in the evening.
