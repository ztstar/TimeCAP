Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the early morning. Humidity levels surged during the same nighttime period, reaching near-saturated conditions, which likely contributed to the development of fog or low cloud cover. A subtle but notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric stability, though no major storm system was evident. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with minimal variation, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions despite a shift in wind direction from west to south and then to northwest later in the day. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind patterns may have created favorable conditions for coastal fog, which is typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
