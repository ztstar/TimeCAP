Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift from a cooler nocturnal phase into a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which suggests a moist air mass is entrenched over the region. Air pressure showed a continuous downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling potential approaching storm systems or low-pressure development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, pointing to changing circulation patterns that could facilitate moisture convergence. These combined factors—rising temperatures, persistent high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds—suggest increasing instability and a heightened likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
