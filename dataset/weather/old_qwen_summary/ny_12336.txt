Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升, indicating a cold front passage followed by a slow warming trend. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the overnight hours, reaching their lowest point before rising slightly in the late morning, suggesting dry air advection during the night. Air pressure exhibited a continuous upward trend throughout the period, peaking in the afternoon and remaining elevated, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning hours and diminished overnight, with a shift in wind direction from west to northwest and later toward the southeast, reflecting changing flow patterns associated with the high-pressure system. These conditions point to a stable, dry, and gradually warming atmosphere, likely leading to clear skies and favorable conditions for the remainder of the day.
