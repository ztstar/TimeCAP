Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Humidity levels reached near saturation, particularly in the late evening and early morning, suggesting high moisture content in the atmosphere conducive to precipitation. Temperature remained relatively stable with slight increases during daylight hours, reflecting a mild but stagnant air mass. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northwesterly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and shifting winds signals a high likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
