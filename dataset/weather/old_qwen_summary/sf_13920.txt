Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting a nocturnal temperature inversion that broke during the day. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near saturation before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, indicating the arrival and dissipation of a moist air mass, likely associated with marine layer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a notable drop in the final hours, signaling a possible approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained gusts from the southwest, suggesting a strengthening onshore flow that may enhance fog formation and coastal cooling. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to westerly during the day reflects dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially leading to variable weather conditions overnight.
