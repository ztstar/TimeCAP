Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility during early hours. A noticeable drop in wind speed occurred during mid-morning, coinciding with a stabilization in air pressure, suggesting a shift toward more settled conditions. The wind direction shifted from northerly to westerly and then southerly, indicating changing airflow patterns that may signal the approach of a new air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and stable pressure suggests an increasing likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the day progresses.
