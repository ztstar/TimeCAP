Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from near-south to more easterly and northeasterly, hinting at a change in airflow patterns possibly associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined factors point toward improving weather conditions, with decreasing humidity and stable pressure likely leading to a dry and comfortable afternoon and evening.
