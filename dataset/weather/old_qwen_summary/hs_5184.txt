Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and dropping through the night before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, reaching near saturation before declining in the late morning, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather with a potential for clearing skies later in the day.
