Temperature showed a steady decline throughout the day, indicating a cooling trend that likely reflects the onset of nocturnal conditions. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with marked spikes during early morning and late evening hours, suggesting periods of moisture accumulation possibly linked to dew formation or atmospheric instability. Air pressure remained relatively stable but exhibited a slight upward trend toward the end of the period, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably during mid-evening and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northeast, indicating dynamic atmospheric movement consistent with a developing frontal influence. The consistent wind direction from the northeast suggests a shift in air mass, potentially introducing cooler, drier air and contributing to the observed temperature drop.
