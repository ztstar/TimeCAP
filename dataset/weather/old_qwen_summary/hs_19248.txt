Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a moderate decline, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that may contribute to localized fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the late night and early morning, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, suggesting a change in airflow that could enhance moisture transport into the area. These combined factors point to a developing moist and unstable air mass, raising the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
