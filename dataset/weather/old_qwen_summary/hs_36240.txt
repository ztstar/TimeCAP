Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures rose, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, warmer air. A notable pressure drop occurred during the night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which was later replaced by a strong high-pressure ridge that brought clear skies and stable conditions in the late afternoon. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, particularly from the west and northwest, suggesting the passage of a frontal boundary, with sustained gusts observed before calming down as high pressure took control. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly and northeasterly, combined with rising pressure and falling humidity, points to the dissipation of moisture and the establishment of more settled, fair weather in the region.
