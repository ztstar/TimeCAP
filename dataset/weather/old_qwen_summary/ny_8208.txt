Over the past 24 hours, a consistent cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping through the night and stabilizing in the early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, followed by a sharp decline as the day progressed, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout, with brief increases likely linked to changes in wind direction, particularly during the early morning and late afternoon. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late hours points to a developing change in local circulation, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front.
