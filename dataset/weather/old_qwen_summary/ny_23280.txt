Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined trends point to a transitioning weather pattern, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
