Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the upper 80s, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that lingered into the early afternoon. A distinct drop in air pressure occurred around midday, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions and increased moisture. Wind patterns shifted dramatically overnight, with calm conditions in the early hours followed by increasing winds from the west and northwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind direction indicates a transition toward potentially overcast or rainy conditions in the near term.
