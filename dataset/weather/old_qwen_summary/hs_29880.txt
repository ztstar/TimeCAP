Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clearer conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southerly to a more variable direction in the late afternoon, with a marked increase in speed and a change toward the northeast, indicating a possible shift in regional airflow. These combined factors suggest that Houston transitioned from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for developing convective activity later.
