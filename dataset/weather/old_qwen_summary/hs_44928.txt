Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend overnight and warming during daylight. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the pre-dawn and early morning hours, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which likely contributed to the cooler feel. A gradual decline in air pressure, particularly during the late night and early morning, points to a developing low-pressure system that may have brought moist, unstable air into the region. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and then southerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics and possible convective activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and decreasing pressure suggests an elevated risk of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the day progresses.
