Over the past 24 hours, a steady cold front moved through New York City, marked by a significant drop in temperature followed by a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking during the early morning hours before declining, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, especially in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Winds remained consistently strong and from a southwestern direction, contributing to the cooling trend and facilitating the movement of moist air inland. These conditions suggest a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with increasing potential for precipitation in the near term.
