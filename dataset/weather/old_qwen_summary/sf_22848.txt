Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning to decline, indicating a period of increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the final hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally consistent throughout the day, with a modest increase during the early morning and a reduction in the late evening, while wind direction shifted toward the northwest and then slightly more westward. These conditions point to a stable, maritime-influenced climate with cooling nights and a tendency for fog or low clouds in the early morning hours, typical of the region’s coastal weather patterns.
