Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime highs. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during midday and remaining low through the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with a weakening moisture inflow. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon, pointing to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then back to easterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns as the high pressure system consolidated. These combined trends suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation and improved visibility, typical of a post-frontal or high-pressure dominance scenario.
