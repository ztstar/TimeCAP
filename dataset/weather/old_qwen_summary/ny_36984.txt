Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions during the early hours. A gradual decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to an evolving weather front that may bring precipitation later in the day.
