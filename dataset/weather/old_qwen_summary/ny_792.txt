Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a transitional period. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, which later decreased as the day progressed, signaling a drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a rise to higher-than-normal levels, a sign of approaching high-pressure dominance and stable, fair weather. Wind speeds exhibited notable variability, with strong gusts in the early morning and late evening, particularly from the northwest and west, consistent with a developing surface pressure gradient. Combined, these patterns point to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system clearing out earlier moisture and stabilizing conditions, likely resulting in improving visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the coming hours.
