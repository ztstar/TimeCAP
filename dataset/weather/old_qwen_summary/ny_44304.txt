Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a steady decline into the night, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of a sunny day transitioning into cooler nighttime conditions. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from moist, stable air to drier, potentially clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight rise during midday, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to calm and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with minor fluctuations, and wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in airflow that may have brought cooler air in during the late evening. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a warm, humid night to a cooler, drier afternoon under a stable high-pressure regime, consistent with favorable weather conditions for outdoor activities.
