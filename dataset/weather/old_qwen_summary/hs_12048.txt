Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, peaking in the afternoon before gradually declining, indicating a warm day with significant daytime heating. Humidity levels increased notably during the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions before decreasing through the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more convective regime. Air pressure showed a general downward trend throughout the day, particularly after midday, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in air mass. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes likely linked to a developing weather disturbance. These combined factors—rising heat, fluctuating humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development in the near term, especially during the evening hours.
