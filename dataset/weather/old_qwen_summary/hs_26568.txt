Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise, indicating the passage of a weather system, likely a cold front. Temperature trends show a notable cooling during the night and early morning, with a gradual warming through the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a cooler, humid phase to a drier, warmer period. Humidity levels peaked dramatically in the early morning, signaling the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which then rapidly dissipated as the day progressed. Wind patterns shifted from near-calm conditions to consistent easterly and southerly flows, with a sudden change in direction during the late afternoon, which may have contributed to the pressure drop and instability. Overall, the data reflects a dynamic shift from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more unstable daytime pattern—potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms.
