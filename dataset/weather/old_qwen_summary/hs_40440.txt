Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the passage of a nocturnal temperature inversion that broke as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, particularly around dawn. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained generally low overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more westerly, reflecting changing boundary layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds suggests a high likelihood of lingering fog and potentially uncomfortable warmth later in the day as temperatures rise.
