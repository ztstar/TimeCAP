Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend toward the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the season. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn before decreasing slightly, suggesting moisture accumulation overnight likely due to cooling air near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure influence that generally supports fair weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from a southerly to easterly direction, potentially contributing to the movement of moist air into the region. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to a southeasterly flow may indicate a change in air mass, possibly signaling the approach of a developing weather system later in the day.
