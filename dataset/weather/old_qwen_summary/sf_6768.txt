Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of marine layer conditions common to the region. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a recovery, possibly signaling the passage of a weak weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases during the late night and early evening, accompanied by variable wind directions suggestive of shifting local flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and low wind speeds during the night supports the persistence of fog and low clouds, which are typical in San Francisco's microclimate.
