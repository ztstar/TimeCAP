Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and remained elevated, suggesting increased moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the development of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure dropped consistently throughout the day, reaching a low point before gradually recovering, signaling the passage of a strong low-pressure system through the region. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, with gusts reaching peak strength from the south and southwest, indicating active atmospheric instability. These conditions together point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
