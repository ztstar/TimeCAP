Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal cycles and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before steadily decreasing during the day, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture that dissipated as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions and consistent wind direction from the southwest, transitioning to more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late afternoon, potentially indicating the influence of local topography or changing pressure gradients. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and foggy night to a warmer, drier, and clearer day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
