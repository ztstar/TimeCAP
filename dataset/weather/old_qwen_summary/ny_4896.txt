Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a prolonged cold period followed by a slow warming trend. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, with a notable drop during the predawn hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early hours, particularly in the pre-dawn period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northeasterly, consistent with frontal passage. These combined trends point to an active weather system moving through the region, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
