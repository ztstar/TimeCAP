Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a brief increase followed by a gradual decline, hinting at the passage of a weak weather system or local pressure adjustment. Wind speeds were highest during the night and early morning, with strong northerly to westerly flow that weakened drastically at dawn and became variable during the day, consistent with the influence of the marine layer and land-sea breeze patterns. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly in the late afternoon and evening signals a possible change in atmospheric circulation, potentially heralding a shift in weather conditions.
