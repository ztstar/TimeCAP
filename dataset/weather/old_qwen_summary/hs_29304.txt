Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and low nighttime cloud cover. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, peaking near mid-morning before plummeting during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass that suppressed moisture content. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a steady decline through the evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late morning and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing pressure gradients and potential storm development. These combined indicators point to a dynamic atmospheric transition, increasing the likelihood of unstable conditions and possible afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
