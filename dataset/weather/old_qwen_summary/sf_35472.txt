Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before increasing slightly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds diminished to near zero during the early morning, then increased again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions suggest the passage of a coastal fog event, driven by marine layer dynamics, which has likely cleared by late afternoon, leading to more stable and drier conditions.
