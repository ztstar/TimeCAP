Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline in the early hours, reaching a low before rising sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of moist air following the front. Air pressure dropped significantly during the night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which was likely responsible for the most intense wind activity and the shift in wind direction. Winds intensified overnight, particularly from the southwest and west, then diminished and shifted to the southeast and south in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with a developing storm system. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and variable winds points to unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially severe weather in the near term.
