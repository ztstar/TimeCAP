Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before beginning to rise again, indicating a shift toward drier air conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking around midday before slightly declining, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, with directional shifts indicating a transition from northwest to southwest winds, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined patterns point to a drying, stabilizing atmosphere under the influence of a high-pressure system, likely leading to clear skies and pleasant conditions in the immediate forecast.
