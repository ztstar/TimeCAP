Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon before rising again, indicating a shift in moisture content likely tied to changing air masses. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then northerly, which may signal the influence of coastal dynamics or an approaching frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the potential for deteriorating weather conditions later in the day, with increased chances of fog, precipitation, or stronger winds.
