- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced decline over the past 24 hours, beginning with sustained high readings in the upper 80s and peaking near saturation before dropping sharply during the latter half of the period. The most significant drop occurred between the 16th and 20th time intervals, indicating a rapid drying trend that may reflect changing air mass dynamics or a shift in local weather conditions. This sustained decrease suggests increasing atmospheric stability and potentially clearer skies, with implications for comfort levels, potential for precipitation, and overall weather patterns in the region.
- Air Pressure (hPa): The air pressure has exhibited a steady decline over the past 24 hours, indicating a developing low-pressure system moving into the region. This trend is characterized by a sustained drop followed by a gradual stabilization at lower levels, which typically precedes unsettled weather conditions. The pattern suggests increasing potential for precipitation and stronger winds, signaling a shift toward more unstable atmospheric conditions.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline during the early hours, reaching a minimum before rapidly increasing through the midday and afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon. A sharp drop followed the peak, indicating a significant cooling trend in the evening, likely influenced by diurnal cycles or changing atmospheric conditions. The pattern suggests a typical daily temperature cycle with a pronounced cooling phase, which may impact local weather phenomena such as fog formation or energy demand.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited low variability during the initial and final phases of the 24-hour period, with prolonged periods of minimal to no wind, suggesting calm conditions. A significant surge in wind activity occurred mid-cycle, followed by sustained elevated levels, indicating a distinct atmospheric disturbance or shifting pressure system. The recurrence of moderate wind bursts, particularly in the latter half, implies ongoing dynamic air movement, potentially signaling the approach or passage of a weather front.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Over the past 24 hours, wind direction exhibited significant variability, shifting from consistently stable northerly to westerly and southerly sectors, with a notable transition toward more easterly and southerly flows in the latter half. Repeated occurrences of zero degrees suggest potential sensor resets or calm conditions, while abrupt shifts—such as from southerly to northerly flows—indicate possible frontal passages or local turbulence. The overall pattern reflects dynamic atmospheric changes, likely driven by evolving pressure systems, with implications for short-term weather forecasting and air quality dispersion in the region.
