Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant nocturnal temperature drop, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. A marked increase in humidity during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp decline, suggests the presence of a fog event that dissipated as temperatures rose. The air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief rise during the afternoon and a subsequent drop, hinting at shifting air masses but no strong frontal passage. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable calm period around midday, though wind direction shifted unexpectedly toward the southeast and south at times, possibly indicating localized flow changes due to topography. These patterns collectively point to a typical maritime influence with fog formation overnight, clearing during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
