Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity fluctuated dramatically, peaking during early morning hours and then plunging, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by a drying influence. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the final hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased sharply in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. These combined signals suggest the arrival of a maritime air mass, likely influencing cloud development and increasing the chance of fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
