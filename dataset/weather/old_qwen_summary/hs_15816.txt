Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again during the day. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which could have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, associated with shifting wind directions from the west and north, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the late afternoon, and variable wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions by day’s end.
