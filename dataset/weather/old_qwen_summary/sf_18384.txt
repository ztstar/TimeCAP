Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning, remaining near maximum for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during that period. Air pressure remained relatively stable until the late evening, when a slight drop occurred, suggesting the possible approach of a changing weather pattern. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable calm period in the middle of the night, though directional shifts revealed a complex flow, including strong southerly and westerly movements. These conditions collectively point to a coastal influence with marine layer dominance overnight and a transition toward clearer, slightly warmer conditions as the day progressed.
