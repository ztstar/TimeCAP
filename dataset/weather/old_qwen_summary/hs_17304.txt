Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning, indicating increasing moisture in the air, which may contribute to a higher likelihood of afternoon showers. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained light and steady throughout the period, with a slight decrease in the final hours, while wind direction shifted gradually from northeasterly to more easterly, suggesting a stable airflow pattern. Together, these indicators point to a transitioning atmosphere with increasing moisture and a stable high-pressure influence, potentially setting the stage for localized thunderstorms later in the day.
