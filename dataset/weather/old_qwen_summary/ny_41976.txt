Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a normal diurnal cycle with a significant overnight drop. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking near saturation during early morning hours before declining sharply, suggesting the presence of dew formation or fog conditions. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly during the night, hinting at a change in air mass and possible frontal influence. The combination of rising pressure, falling humidity, and moderate winds points to improving conditions, with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air in the coming hours.
