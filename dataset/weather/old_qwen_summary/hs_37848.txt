Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp increase in the late night and early morning, suggesting possible dew formation or fog development. Air pressure steadily rose, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to east-southeast during the early hours, potentially signaling a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. Overall, the data points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation and improved visibility in the coming hours.
