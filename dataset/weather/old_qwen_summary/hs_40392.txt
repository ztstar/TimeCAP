Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front that brought lower temperatures during the night and early morning. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, which contributed to overcast conditions and a high likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before slowly rising, consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in direction from southerly to westerly and eventually northwesterly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds suggests a transition period that could lead to scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
