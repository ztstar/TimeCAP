Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon before rising once more in the evening, suggesting a possible marine influence. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and late evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including a shift toward the northwest and west, consistent with offshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, cooling, and increasing wind activity, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns during the transition from summer to fall.
