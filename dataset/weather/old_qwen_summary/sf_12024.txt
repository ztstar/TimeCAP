Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually increasing in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of marine fog or dense moist air advancing from the Pacific. Air pressure gradually decreased through the night and early morning, then stabilized, pointing to a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure feature that may bring changeable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, with a notable lull in the early morning hours, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest, which may signal a shift in airflow patterns. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, particularly in the late afternoon, suggests the potential for increased fog or low cloud cover later in the day, which could affect visibility and coastal temperatures.
