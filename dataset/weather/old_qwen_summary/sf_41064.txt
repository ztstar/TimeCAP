Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, consistent with typical coastal marine conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the late evening, followed by a recovery, indicating a passing weather system or shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds remained generally low, except for a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, hinting at a change in airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind directions points to the influence of a marine layer, likely contributing to foggy conditions and a persistent cool, damp feel across the city.
