Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily into the afternoon, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then gradually decreased in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a changing weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition period, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions or a developing storm system later in the day.
