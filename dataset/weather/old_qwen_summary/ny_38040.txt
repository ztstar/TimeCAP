Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels show a sharp drop during the early hours, followed by a significant increase in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the possibility of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased overnight, peaking in the early morning, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with strong gusts in the early and late hours, particularly from the northwest and west, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions. The shift in wind direction from the west to the north and then southeast may reflect changing air mass influences, potentially setting the stage for a transition in weather patterns.
