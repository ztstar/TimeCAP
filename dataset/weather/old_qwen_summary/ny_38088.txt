Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent downward trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a possible passage of a frontal system or shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, which is often associated with the approach and then departure of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southwest to more westerly and northerly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather event, likely involving a passing cold front, which may have brought cooler temperatures and increased moisture overnight, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
