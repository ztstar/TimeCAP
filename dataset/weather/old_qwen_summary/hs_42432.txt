Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass and potential clearing conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline during the late afternoon, which may suggest the approach of a weakening frontal system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly sectors, signaling a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night phase to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could influence the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
