Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and night hours, dropping significantly by mid-afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and early afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south, potentially indicating an onshore flow associated with a developing or approaching weather disturbance. These combined trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, with potential for unstable conditions and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the temperature rise and moisture shift.
