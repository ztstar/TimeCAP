Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the morning hours, indicating the passage of a cold front overnight. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting saturated conditions and potential fog formation, which then sharply decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a notable drop in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined indicators suggest deteriorating weather conditions, including the potential for precipitation and gusty winds in the coming hours.
