Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or light precipitation, likely due to condensation as temperatures cooled. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, signaling the absence of a strong low-pressure system but consistent atmospheric stability. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northerly directions, with sustained winds from the northwest in the late evening, potentially bringing cooler air and clearing skies. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and a shift toward drier, cooler winds implies the onset of clearer conditions in the coming hours, with a likely transition to more stable and comfortable weather.
