Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting saturated air conditions and potential for fog or mist. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, peaking before a slight decline, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at a change in air mass or the onset of a frontal influence. Overall, the data suggests a transition toward more stable, dry conditions, though residual moisture and changing wind patterns could still support localized afternoon showers.
