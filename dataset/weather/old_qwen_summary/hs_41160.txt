Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking during the early hours before declining significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal boundary layer that trapped moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight and a gradual decline toward the end of the period, which may reflect the approach of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds showed moderate variability, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing airflow patterns, potentially linked to a developing sea breeze or synoptic-scale influence. The combination of high humidity, variable wind, and fluctuating pressure points to favorable conditions for the development of localized thunderstorms, particularly during the late afternoon hours.
