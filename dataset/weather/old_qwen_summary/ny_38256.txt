Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, indicating a cold and stable overnight period. Humidity levels fluctuated sharply, with prolonged periods of near-saturation, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, especially in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined patterns point to a transition toward potentially inclement weather, including possible precipitation and stronger winds in the coming hours.
