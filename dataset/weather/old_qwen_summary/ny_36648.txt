Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold, stable night to a progressively milder day. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before beginning to decline, suggesting possible fog or drizzle during the overnight period. Air pressure reached a peak in the late morning and remained high into the afternoon, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, with gusts originating from the southeast, tapering off as the day progressed, and shifting to more westerly and northerly directions later in the evening. These patterns collectively point to a post-frontal clearing trend, with improving visibility and a likely transition to drier, more comfortable conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
