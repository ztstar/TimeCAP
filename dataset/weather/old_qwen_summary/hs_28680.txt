Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the late night and early morning, indicating a drying trend, though they remained relatively high overnight, contributing to a muggy feel. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a peak during the early evening, and directional shifts from northwest to southeast and back, hinting at changing air mass influences. These patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, which may have brought cooler, drier air and could lead to clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
