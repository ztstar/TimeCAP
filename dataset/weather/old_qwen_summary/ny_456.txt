Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a slight recovery in the final hours, indicating a cooling trend that likely began overnight. Humidity remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or drizzle, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the last 12 hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds picked up in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, which could have transported cooler air into the city. The combination of dropping temperatures, high humidity, and increasing pressure points to a transition from a moist, unstable period to a drier, more stable, and cooler regime in the coming hours.
