Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog typical of the region’s microclimate. A significant shift in air pressure occurred during the late evening, with a sharp drop followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a weather front that may have brought coastal fog and gusty winds. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late evening and overnight, driven by a strong southerly to westerly flow, likely influenced by a pressure gradient associated with a low-pressure system approaching from the Pacific. The wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly by morning, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation that could signal the clearing of fog and a return to more stable, coastal conditions.
