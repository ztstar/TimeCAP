Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation and persisting through the early morning, indicating potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased humidity and stable wind conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more southerly-southeasterly pattern in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transitional weather phase, potentially bringing overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term.
