Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining through the day, suggesting increasing atmospheric moisture that could support convective activity later. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase overnight and a small drop toward the end, hinting at a possible shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds were consistently low and unchanging, suggesting weak synoptic-scale forcing, while wind direction exhibited a complex pattern, shifting from northerly to southeasterly and back, potentially indicating local circulation or a slow-moving front. Together, these conditions point to a stable but humid atmosphere with potential for afternoon thunderstorms if additional lift is introduced.
