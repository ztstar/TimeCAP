Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and into the early morning, followed by a slight recovery, signaling the possible passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late afternoon, likely due to changing pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly patterns suggests evolving atmospheric circulation, which could influence incoming weather systems.
