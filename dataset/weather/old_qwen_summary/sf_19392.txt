Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced consistently high humidity levels, approaching saturation, which contributed to a persistent dampness in the air. Temperatures showed a gradual upward trend, indicating a slow warming pattern during the day, though the overall climate remained cool and stable. Air pressure remained largely steady, with a brief dip in the early morning hours, suggesting a minor atmospheric fluctuation but no significant storm system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, peaking in the midday to early evening, with winds shifting from southerly to more westerly and then southerly directions, indicating a change in circulation. These conditions collectively suggest a marine layer influence with weak synoptic forcing, reinforcing the typical foggy and cool coastal conditions expected in San Francisco.
