Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with strong gusts from the northeast, potentially signaling the approach of a changing weather front. Combined with shifting wind directions, these patterns point to dynamic atmospheric conditions that could lead to unstable weather, including possible thunderstorms, in the near future.
