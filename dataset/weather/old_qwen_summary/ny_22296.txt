Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a cooling trend that likely reflects the influence of a developing cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting increasing moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds weakened during the early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and a strengthening southeasterly wind suggests the possibility of increasing cloud cover and a potential for light precipitation later in the day.
