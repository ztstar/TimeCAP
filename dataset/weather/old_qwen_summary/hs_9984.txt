Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, indicating a persistent moisture-laden atmosphere conducive to fog or light precipitation. Air pressure showed a notable rise, peaking in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies overnight. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, which may have triggered the temperature drop and increased wind activity, potentially leading to transient showers or thunderstorms before stabilizing under drier, more settled conditions.
