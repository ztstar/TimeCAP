Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. A prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the night and early morning, suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the mid-to-late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions from west to north and east, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes possibly linked to a coastal breeze pattern or frontal influence. The combination of these factors points to a transition from foggy, cool conditions toward a more stable, drier afternoon, with potential for clearing skies later in the day.
