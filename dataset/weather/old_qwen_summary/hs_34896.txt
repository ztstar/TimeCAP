Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the potential for clearing skies and improved air quality. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, reaching a peak in the mid-afternoon before declining slightly, which is often associated with the passage of a high-pressure ridge and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, especially during the night, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northerly in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable environment to a drier, more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more comfortable conditions later in the day.
