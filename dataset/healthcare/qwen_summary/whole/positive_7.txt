Influenza activity has shown a sustained and steep upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with both influenza A and B strains contributing significantly to the rising positivity rates. The peak in testing positivity occurred in the most recent weeks, indicating a high burden of respiratory illness in the population, likely driven by widespread circulation of influenza A. Notably, the proportion of influenza A cases has consistently outpaced that of influenza B, suggesting a stronger dominance of A in the current season. A sharp decline in positivity rates following the peak suggests the possibility of a waning phase or the onset of seasonal plateau, though elevated levels remain concerning. The consistent increase in specimen testing volume supports the reliability of the trend data and underscores the need for continued public health surveillance and vaccination efforts.
