Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the early hours, with gusts from the northwest to north sectors, but diminished significantly by late afternoon, suggesting weakening synoptic forcing. The shift in wind direction from northwesterly to northeasterly in the late evening reflects a possible change in air mass, possibly signaling the approach of a more humid and unstable regime.
