Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a period of high moisture content likely conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a notable increase in the afternoon, suggesting an approaching high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, signaling a change in air mass influence. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment toward a drier, more stable daytime regime, potentially leading to improved visibility and reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
