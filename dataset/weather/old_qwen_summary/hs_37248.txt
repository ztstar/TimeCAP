Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region’s climate. Humidity remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which gradually decreased as temperatures rose and air circulation increased. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the day, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions pointing to changing air mass dynamics, possibly linked to a frontal influence or local convective activity. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day if moisture and instability persist.
