Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a persistent marine influence and potential for fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind patterns shifted significantly around midday, with a sudden change in direction from west-southwest to southeast, accompanied by increased wind speeds, likely driven by a shift in regional pressure gradients. These conditions point to a dynamic coastal weather regime, with strong marine layer behavior and possible overnight fog persisting into the morning hours.
