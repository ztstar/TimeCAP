Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning, dropped significantly during midday, and began to rise again in the evening, suggesting a drying trend during daylight hours likely due to increased wind and solar heating. Air pressure showed a sustained high reading during the night and early morning, then slightly declined in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with strong southwest to west winds dominating, which likely contributed to the cooling and moisture transport. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the late evening may suggest an approaching change in air mass, potentially bringing cooler, more stable conditions.
