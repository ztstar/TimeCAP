Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning hours before steadily declining, suggesting the presence of nighttime moisture accumulation and daytime drying. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a local atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a notable shift in direction from southerly to southeasterly and then to westerly in the late evening, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, possibly increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms.
