Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s marine layer behavior. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings calm and stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with stronger winds emerging in the early morning hours before tapering off, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to diurnal patterns and local topography. These trends point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with nighttime cooling, morning fog, and afternoon wind shifts driven by sea breeze dynamics and the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
