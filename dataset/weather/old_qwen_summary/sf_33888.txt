Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of coastal conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the morning, consistent with a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a shift to more variable and mild breezes in the afternoon, likely due to changing local pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and low wind suggests that fog formation and persistence were likely, which can impact visibility and create a cool, damp feel across the city.
