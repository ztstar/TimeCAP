Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn, which suggests possible fog formation or condensation. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that reflects changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a developing frontal system, potentially bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
