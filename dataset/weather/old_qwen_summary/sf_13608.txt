Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the early hours of the day, which likely contributed to the development of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west to southwest, suggesting the influence of coastal breezes or a developing wind event. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the late evening may signal a change in air mass, potentially bringing milder conditions or altering precipitation patterns.
