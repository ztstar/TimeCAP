Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting possible moisture advection or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overall, with a distinct shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southeasterly during the late night and morning, likely associated with a boundary layer adjustment. The combination of rising humidity, increasing pressure, and changing wind patterns points to an approaching stable air mass, which may suppress storm development but could also lead to high overnight humidity and potential for fog early in the morning.
