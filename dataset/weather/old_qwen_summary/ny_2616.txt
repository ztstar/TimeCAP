Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, reaching a low point in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the night and dropping sharply in the late afternoon, which may have contributed to the perception of colder conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching their peak from midnight to dawn, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from northerly to westerly and then southerly. These trends suggest a transition toward drier, colder, and more stable conditions, with the potential for crisp, clear mornings ahead.
