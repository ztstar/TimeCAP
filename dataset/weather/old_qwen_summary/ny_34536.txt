Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, indicating the presence of a high-pressure system that has helped maintain calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the southeast and later from the southwest, suggesting a shift in airflow that could signal the approach of a weather front. Combined with the drop in wind direction consistency and rising wind speeds, the data suggests the city may be transitioning into a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially bringing precipitation later in the day.
