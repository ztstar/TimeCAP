Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-evening, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clearing conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more westerly and then northerly direction, with speeds remaining moderate, suggesting changing airflow dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, potentially overcast night to a drier, more stable afternoon, with a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
