Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A significant drop in humidity coincided with a sharp increase in wind speed, indicating the arrival of a strong offshore flow that likely brought drier air from inland areas. This wind surge was accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly onshore to offshore, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, then declined sharply in the late morning, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. The combination of drying air, strong winds, and fluctuating pressure suggests an active weather transition, increasing the risk of gusty conditions and reduced visibility, particularly near coastal and exposed areas.
