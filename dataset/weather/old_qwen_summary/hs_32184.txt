Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of moist air mass that may contribute to overnight condensation or fog. Air pressure showed a slight drop toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly, hinting at a changing airflow pattern possibly linked to frontal activity. These combined indicators suggest the potential for unstable conditions, with elevated moisture and shifting winds increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
