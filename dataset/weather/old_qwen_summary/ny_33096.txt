Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the 80s and 90s, suggesting the presence of low-level moisture and possible fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and south, which may have brought in warmer air and contributed to the temperature rebound. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and later westerly suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather system.
