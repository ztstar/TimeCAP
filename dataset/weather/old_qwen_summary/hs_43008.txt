Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a persistent pattern of elevated humidity levels, with intervals of very high moisture content, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that could support instability. Temperature fluctuations remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, indicating a lack of significant heating or cooling trends. Air pressure showed a gradual decline followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the increased cloudiness and precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly to northerly wind directions, which could signify the approach of a frontal boundary. Together, these indicators point to an environment conducive to thunderstorm development, particularly given the combination of high moisture, destabilizing pressure trends, and increasing wind shear.
