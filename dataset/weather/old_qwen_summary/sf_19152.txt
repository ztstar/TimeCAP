Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase with early morning lows. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests fog formation or dense mist, typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable until the late afternoon, when a slight drop occurred, potentially signaling the approach of a changing weather pattern. Wind speeds were consistently low, with minimal variation, implying limited atmospheric mixing and contributing to the persistence of fog and cool conditions. The wind direction shifted notably in the final hours, turning more southerly, which may indicate a change in airflow associated with a coastal breeze or an approaching weather system.
