Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours, reducing visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, particularly from the southeast and south, which may have aided moisture transport into the region. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the late afternoon and evening hints at a possible change in air mass, potentially signaling a transition to drier and more stable conditions.
