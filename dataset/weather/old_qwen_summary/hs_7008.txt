Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a cycle of moisture accumulation and dispersion likely driven by daytime convection. Air pressure remained stable for most of the day, with a brief increase followed by a slight decline, signaling minimal large-scale weather system influence but possible localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to a more variable pattern, potentially indicating the influence of a developing thermal low or local circulation. These conditions collectively point to a warm, humid day with a potential for isolated afternoon thunderstorms, especially as moisture and instability build toward evening.
