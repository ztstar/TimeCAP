Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply during the day, consistent with the coastal fog and low cloud formation typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure ridge building over the area, which likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief spikes during transition periods, and wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and then back to westerly, suggesting a complex interaction between onshore flow and local topographic effects. Overall, the data suggest a coastal weather pattern characterized by morning fog, afternoon clearing, and a stable air mass that may persist into the coming days.
