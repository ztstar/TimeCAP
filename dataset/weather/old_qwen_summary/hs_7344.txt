Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation during early morning hours, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that brought stable and dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and then back to the west-southwest, indicating changing flow patterns likely associated with a developing frontal boundary. Overall, the data suggests a transition from humid, stable conditions overnight to drier, more variable winds during the day, increasing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient convective energy accumulates.
