Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained generally light overnight but increased significantly in the late evening, with a shift toward more variable and southerly directions, possibly indicating the onset of a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer and more stable weather conditions in the coming hours.
