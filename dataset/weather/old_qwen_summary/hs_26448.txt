Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend followed by a sharp daytime warming, indicating a transition from stable nighttime conditions to increasing solar heating. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation early in the morning. A notable pressure increase during midday, particularly in the afternoon hours, signals the approach of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to northerly directions during the night, then reoriented toward the east-southeast in the afternoon—consistent with a change in the prevailing air mass. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and steady wind speeds indicates a drying trend in the afternoon, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and favoring comfortable conditions later in the day.
