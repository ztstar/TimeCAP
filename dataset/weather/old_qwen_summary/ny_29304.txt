Temperature steadily declined through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity surged dramatically during the same period, peaking at near saturation levels, indicating the presence of fog or precipitation. Air pressure showed a notable increase overnight, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with strong winds from the west and northwest in the early morning, followed by a sharp drop in speed and a change in direction, hinting at a weakening frontal boundary. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and windy period to a milder, more stable environment, potentially clearing skies by midday.
