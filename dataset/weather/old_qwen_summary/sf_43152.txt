Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase during the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed precipitation. Wind patterns were variable, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, especially from the west and south, possibly enhancing coastal fog advection. The combination of high humidity, dropping temperatures, and shifting wind directions points to a high likelihood of fog persistence into the early morning hours, which could impact visibility and commute conditions.
