Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining throughout the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the hours before dawn, indicating increased moisture availability that may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably around midnight, transitioning from westerly to northerly and easterly directions, likely due to changing pressure gradients and possibly signaling a shift in air mass. These combined factors point to a transition toward more stable, drier, and cooler weather conditions in the coming hours.
