Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. A prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, particularly during the night and early morning, suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the region’s marine layer characteristics. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, including a sharp drop followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a weather system that may have brought instability and changing conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, except for brief increases in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction signaling changing airflow patterns, possibly from offshore to onshore or frontal influences. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather environment, likely contributing to foggy mornings and variable conditions through the day, which can affect visibility, travel, and local microclimates.
