Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked sharply during the overnight hours and again in the late evening, indicating periods of saturated air, likely contributing to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable weather and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and south, consistent with developing storm conditions. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these factors point to a high likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
