Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning. A notable increase in humidity coincided with the lowest temperatures, culminating in saturation levels during the early hours, which likely contributed to fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaking in the morning, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system that has brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with near-calm conditions in the early hours, followed by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cold, stable air mass to a potentially warmer and more humid regime, with the possibility of clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
