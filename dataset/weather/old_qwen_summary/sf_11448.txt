Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual回升 in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight hours, peaking in the midday period, indicating a potential increase in fog or low cloud cover typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, particularly in the early hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind patterns were variable, with periods of calm interspersed with shifts in direction—especially from the south and southeast—likely influencing localized coastal airflow and fog movement. These combined indicators point to a transitional weather phase, with lingering marine layer influence and the potential for patchy fog or drizzle, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
