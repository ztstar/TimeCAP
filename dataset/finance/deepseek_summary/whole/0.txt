Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 demonstrated a generally upward trend with recent volatility, signaling renewed investor confidence amid shifting risk appetite. The VIX showed a notable decline followed by a rebound, reflecting a temporary reduction in market fear that was later challenged by renewed uncertainty. Global equity indices, including the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, exhibited mixed momentum, with modest gains offset by periodic pullbacks, suggesting cautious sentiment across major markets. Gold and crude oil prices both recorded sustained upward trajectories, indicating growing safe-haven demand and inflationary concerns, respectively. Meanwhile, the USD weakened against the EUR and JPY while strengthening slightly against the CNY, pointing to divergent monetary policy expectations and shifting global trade dynamics.
