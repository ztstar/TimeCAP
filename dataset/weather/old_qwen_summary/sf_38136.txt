Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with periods of near-saturated conditions early in the cycle, suggesting possible fog formation or marine layer influence. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the south and southwest, likely driven by coastal wind dynamics and pressure gradients. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and strong onshore winds points to a persistent marine layer, which may result in foggy conditions and cooler temperatures through the day ahead.
