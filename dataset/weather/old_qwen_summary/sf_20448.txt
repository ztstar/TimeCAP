Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low-lying stratus clouds common in the region during cool nights. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions and clears out marine layer clouds. Wind speeds remained low with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted progressively from the northwest to the southeast, indicating a change in local circulation likely tied to the movement of the high-pressure ridge. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool night to a clearer, milder afternoon, consistent with typical Bay Area weather dynamics.
