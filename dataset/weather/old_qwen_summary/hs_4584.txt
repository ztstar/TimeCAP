Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the late evening and early morning hours, indicating a transition to cooler conditions, likely due to a shift in air mass or cloud cover. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night, peaking in the early morning, which suggests saturated air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline in the middle of the period, followed by a slight rebound, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system that may have influenced storm development. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight hours, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, aligning with a possible frontal boundary or outflow from developing convection. The shift in wind direction toward the northwest in the early morning further supports the arrival of a new air mass, which could signal a change in weather patterns, possibly bringing more stable conditions or precipitation.
