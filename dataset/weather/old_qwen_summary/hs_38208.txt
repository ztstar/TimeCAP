Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that may have contributed to increased cloud cover. A gradual decline in atmospheric pressure, particularly in the latter half of the day, indicates the approaching influence of a low-pressure system, which can bring unstable conditions and potential for thunderstorms. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly, consistent with inflow from the Gulf of Mexico, reinforcing the likelihood of moisture transport. Together, these trends point to a developing weather pattern conducive to convective activity, warranting vigilance for sudden storms, especially later in the day.
