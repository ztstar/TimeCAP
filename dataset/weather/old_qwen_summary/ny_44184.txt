Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a low before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a significant spike during the night, peaking at saturation levels, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation in the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and later southerly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving weather conditions in the coming hours, with a likely transition to partly sunny skies.
