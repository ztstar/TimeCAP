Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures rose. Air pressure fluctuated sharply in the early morning hours, with a sudden drop followed by a sustained period of stable pressure, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric conditions linked to a passing weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest, consistent with offshore flow that often brings clearer skies but also enhances heat retention. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the final hours hints at a possible influence from a developing marine layer or synoptic-scale adjustment, which could affect visibility and temperature stability overnight.
