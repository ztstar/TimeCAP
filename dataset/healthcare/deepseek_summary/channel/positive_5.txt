- Number of specimens tested: The indicator demonstrates a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the latter half, suggesting increasing respiratory influenza activity. A peak was observed in the most recent weeks, followed by a notable decline, which may indicate the onset of a post-peak phase or a potential plateau in the current outbreak. The sharp rise and subsequent drop highlight dynamic transmission patterns, warranting continued surveillance to assess whether this reflects a seasonal peak or an emerging shift in influenza epidemiology.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a steep and sustained upward trend over the past 15 weeks, signaling a rapid escalation in influenza A activity, likely indicating the onset of a strong seasonal surge. A pronounced peak was reached in the most recent week, followed by a significant decline, suggesting the peak of the outbreak may have passed. This pattern—rapid rise, sharp peak, and notable decrease—aligns with typical epidemic behavior, implying a short but intense wave of influenza transmission that may necessitate adjusted public health response and resource allocation.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a steady upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a pronounced acceleration in the latter half, suggesting a significant surge in influenza B activity. The peak occurred in the 16th week, followed by a gradual decline, indicating the potential onset of a post-peak phase, though levels remain substantially elevated. This pattern reflects a strong seasonal influenza B outbreak with sustained high transmission, warranting continued surveillance and public health preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the final phase, suggesting a significant surge in influenza activity. The peak occurred in the 17th week, followed by a notable decline, indicating a possible transition from a peak phase to a post-peak decline. This pattern aligns with typical seasonal influenza dynamics, raising concerns about ongoing community transmission and the need for enhanced surveillance and public health preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp increase in the latter half of the period, indicating a significant rise in influenza A positivity rates. A clear inflection point occurs around week 12, followed by a peak and subsequent decline, suggesting the onset and waning of a major influenza surge. The sustained elevation in positivity rates, even during the decline phase, underscores ongoing community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final seven weeks, signaling a significant increase in influenza B positivity rates. A notable inflection point occurs around week 12, followed by a sharp rise that peaks in the most recent weeks, suggesting the onset of a strong influenza B season. This pattern indicates growing community transmission and warrants heightened surveillance, diagnostic preparedness, and public health planning to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
