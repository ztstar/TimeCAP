Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which then decreased during the afternoon as conditions became drier and more stable. Air pressure remained relatively high throughout most of the period, with a brief drop in the final hours, signaling a possible change in weather patterns, possibly associated with an approaching system. Wind activity was strongest in the early evening and late night, shifting from southwest to westward directions, which is typical of marine layer influence, before calming significantly during the early morning. The return of stronger winds in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, hints at a potential shift in the synoptic flow, possibly bringing cooler or more variable conditions in the coming hours.
