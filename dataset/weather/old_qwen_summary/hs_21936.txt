Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing at lower levels. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking earlier in the day and gradually decreasing, suggesting a shift toward drier air as the night progressed. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the influence of a developing high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest toward the northeast, pointing to a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
