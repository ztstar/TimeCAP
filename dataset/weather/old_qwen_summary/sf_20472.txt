Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with marine layer formation. Air pressure remained largely stable, with a minor increase in the late afternoon, signaling a potential shift in atmospheric conditions, though no significant storm systems were detected. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, but wind direction exhibited notable variability, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon, reflecting changes in local coastal airflow patterns. These observations collectively point to the influence of a persistent marine layer, with high humidity and cool temperatures, which may contribute to continued foggy conditions into the next day.
