Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high, frequently near or at saturation, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which can contribute to fog formation and a damp chill. Air pressure showed a generally stable pattern with minor fluctuations, suggesting a relatively stable atmospheric regime with no strong frontal systems passing through. Wind activity was intermittent, with brief bursts of moderate speed and a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, potentially bringing in marine air and reinforcing coastal fog. These conditions collectively point to a typical San Francisco coastal weather pattern—cool, foggy, and damp—common during the late summer and early fall months.
