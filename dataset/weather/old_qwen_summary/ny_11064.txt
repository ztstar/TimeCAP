Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicates the passage of a low-pressure system through the region, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual warming through the day, peaking in the mid-afternoon before cooling again, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by changing cloud cover and wind patterns. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, dropping sharply during the day, which is consistent with the development of a warm front and the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with sustained easterly to southeasterly flow, indicating the influence of a developing storm system approaching from the Atlantic. The shift in wind direction toward the northwest in the late afternoon may signal the arrival of a cold front, potentially leading to a change in weather conditions with possible precipitation and cooler temperatures later tonight.
