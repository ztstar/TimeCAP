Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the overnight period before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with gusts reaching strong levels and a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with storm development. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
