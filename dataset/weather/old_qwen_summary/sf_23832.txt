Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually recovering in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a slow recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought moist, stable air. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but increased in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southwest to northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that may bring clearer skies. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool, and stable maritime influence to a drier, slightly more variable regime as the system moves out.
