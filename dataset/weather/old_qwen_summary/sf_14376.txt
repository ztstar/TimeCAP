Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, suggesting the presence of marine fog or increased moisture infiltration from the Pacific Ocean. Air pressure showed fluctuating but generally stable conditions, with brief spikes that may reflect shifting air masses, though no major storm systems were evident. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by coastal breezes and the interaction of land and sea temperature differences. The combination of high humidity, moderate to strong winds, and variable pressure suggests a persistent marine influence, which may contribute to lingering fog or overcast conditions into the coming hours.
