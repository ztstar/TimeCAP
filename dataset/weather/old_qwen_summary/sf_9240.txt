Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, suggesting the formation of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum. A notable spike in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently low except for a brief increase during the early morning, with wind direction shifting markedly from northwest to more southerly and then back, indicating localized circulation changes possibly tied to marine layer dynamics. These conditions point to a typical marine-influenced climate pattern, with foggy conditions overnight and clearing skies by midday, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
