Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially overnight, with gusts exceeding 10 m/s, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate dynamic atmospheric instability. These conditions collectively point to a strong cold front passing through, bringing potentially disruptive weather including strong winds and localized fog, with implications for transportation and outdoor activities.
