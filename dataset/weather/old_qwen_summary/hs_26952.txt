Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nighttime temperature drop and a daytime recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a heavy, damp air quality and increased potential for fog or drizzle. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, likely signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast, suggesting a shift in wind patterns consistent with a developing storm system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and elevated wind speeds implies a heightened risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
