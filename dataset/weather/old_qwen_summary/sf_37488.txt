Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature, with a steady decline during the early morning hours followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or marine layer conditions, which then decreased as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited strong fluctuations, with frequent drops associated with passing weather systems, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions typical of the region’s coastal climate. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with strong southerly and westerly flows, likely contributing to the cooling effect and fog formation. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly in the late afternoon may signal a changing weather pattern, potentially leading to clearer skies and warmer conditions later in the day.
