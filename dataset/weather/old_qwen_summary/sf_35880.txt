Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity, consistent with a high-pressure ridge influencing the area. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, aligning with typical coastal breeze patterns and potentially enhancing marine layer development. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and persistent wind from the ocean suggests continued fog and cool conditions, especially in low-lying coastal areas, which may impact visibility and outdoor activities.
