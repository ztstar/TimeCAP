Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, likely driven by the pressure gradient and coastal influences, contributing to the dispersal of fog. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then back to offshore suggests dynamic local circulation changes, potentially influencing visibility and temperature gradients across the region.
