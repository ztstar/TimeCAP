Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through mid-morning. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours preceded a period of very calm winds, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. As pressure began to rise later in the day, wind speeds increased and shifted in direction, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation, possibly linked to a developing high-pressure ridge. These conditions point to a transition from a chilly, foggy morning to a warmer, clearer afternoon, with potential for improving visibility and stable conditions in the coming hours.
