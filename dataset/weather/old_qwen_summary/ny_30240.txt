Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the afternoon, indicating the onset of warming, likely due to increasing solar exposure and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning and late evening, peaking at saturation, which suggests a strong likelihood of fog or light precipitation during those periods. A notable drop in air pressure during the early to mid-day hours was followed by a gradual recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the midday hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. Overall, the data point to a transition from a cool, humid, and potentially foggy morning toward a warmer, drier, and more stable afternoon, with possible lingering effects from a passing frontal system.
