Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the night, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that contributed to a saturated environment. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-evening, followed by a sharp rise, indicating the passage of a weather system that likely brought brief instability. Wind speeds remained low for most of the period, with a slight increase in the final hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest the influence of a passing front, with conditions transitioning from warm and humid to cooler and more stable, possibly leading to clearer skies and more settled weather in the near term.
