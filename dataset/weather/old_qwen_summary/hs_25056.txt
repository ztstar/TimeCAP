Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong warming trend likely driven by solar heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining near saturation before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds increased during the afternoon and then decreased overnight, with directional shifts indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly associated with a developing weather system. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for convective activity later in the day due to the combination of heat, residual moisture, and dynamic wind shifts.
