Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City declined significantly during the early morning hours before rebounding in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature swing likely driven by a cold front passage. Relative humidity remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent moisture in the air, which may have contributed to fog or low visibility during those hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, peaking in the late morning and holding steady, signaling the arrival and dominance of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds weakened gradually during the day, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwest to west and eventually southwest, reflecting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. Combined, these trends point to a transition from a cold, damp, and windy period to a milder, drier, and more stable environment, likely resulting in improving weather conditions by late day.
