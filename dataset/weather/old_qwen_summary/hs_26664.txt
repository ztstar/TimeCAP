Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual morning warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and minimal cloud cover. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp rise during early morning hours, suggesting possible dew formation or a shift in air mass, followed by a drying trend through the afternoon. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure system enhancing stability and suppressing convective activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling the influence of a developing sea breeze or synoptic-scale flow. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward more stable, dry, and breezy conditions, which could limit the likelihood of thunderstorms but contribute to comfortable daytime temperatures.
