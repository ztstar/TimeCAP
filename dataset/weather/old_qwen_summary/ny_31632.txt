Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling period likely associated with clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or dew, particularly during the coldest part of the night. A notable drop in air pressure in the late morning and early afternoon coincided with changing wind patterns, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that brought in moist air and unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with gusts from the south and southeast, potentially contributing to the dissipation of overnight fog and mixing of the lower atmosphere. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, coupled with rising temperatures and decreasing humidity, points to the onset of a warmer, more unstable air mass moving in, possibly heralding a change in weather pattern.
