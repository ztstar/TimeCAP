Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, with a notable drop in the early morning hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the northwesterly direction, with increased speeds in the late afternoon and evening, possibly indicating a change in atmospheric flow associated with the developing system. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.
