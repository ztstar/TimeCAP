Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture and likely contributing to fog or overcast conditions. A steady rise in air pressure suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors point to a transition period, with the potential for improving conditions and a gradual decrease in the likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
