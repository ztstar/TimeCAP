Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, reaching a minimum during the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content indicating saturated air conditions, likely contributing to foggy or misty conditions during the night. Air pressure exhibited a pronounced drop, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained modest overall but increased notably toward the end, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to the arrival of a storm system, potentially bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
