Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and a heavy dew point. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities from the southeast, suggesting potential for localized wind shifts or developing convection. The consistent wind direction from the southeast to south-southeast aligns with typical Gulf moisture transport, reinforcing the likelihood of humid, potentially unstable conditions later in the day.
