Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog or low clouds that persisted through the early hours. A notable shift in wind direction occurred mid-night, transitioning from northerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating a change in air mass flow, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or synoptic influence. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the latter part of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Combined with increasing wind speeds and shifting wind patterns, these indicators point to a dynamic coastal weather regime, potentially setting the stage for a change in conditions such as increased precipitation or stronger offshore winds.
