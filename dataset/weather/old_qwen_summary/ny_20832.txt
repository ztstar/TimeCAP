Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a sharp drop in the evening, indicating a transition from a stable cold period to a more dynamic weather system. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during midday, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a marked increase through the early afternoon, reaching a peak before a rapid decline, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the midday hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, consistent with the inflow of a frontal boundary. Together, these trends imply the onset of unstable weather, likely including rain or storms, particularly in the late evening and overnight hours.
