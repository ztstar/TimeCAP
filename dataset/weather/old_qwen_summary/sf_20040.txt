Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with conditions consistently near or at 100% for more than half the day, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist. Temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, reaching a low before gradually increasing in the late afternoon, reflecting a typical coastal cooling pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations suggesting no significant weather system passage, consistent with a stable maritime environment. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, which may signal a weakening of the onshore flow and a potential reduction in fog penetration. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and light winds points to persistent coastal fog and potentially reduced visibility, especially during early morning hours.
