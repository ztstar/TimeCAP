Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, then fluctuating sharply before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late evening and early morning, indicating the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more westerly and then to a variable direction by late evening, with increased speeds in the afternoon and early night, consistent with dynamic atmospheric changes associated with the low-pressure system. These trends together suggest a period of unsettled weather, likely bringing overcast skies, potential for showers or thunderstorms, and a noticeable cooling trend overnight, which could impact evening commutes and outdoor activities.
