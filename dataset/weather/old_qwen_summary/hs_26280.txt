Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon and dropping significantly overnight, indicating the passage of a cooling front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, reaching near saturation, which contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable feel, particularly in the early morning. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions, then a weakening front. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening, with gusts reaching higher velocities and a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential storm development. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind activity points to an elevated risk of thunderstorms later in the day, especially as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
