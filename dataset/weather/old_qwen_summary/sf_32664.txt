Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a slow decline, indicating a period of high moisture saturation likely associated with fog formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be linked to shifting wind patterns and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, with strong gusts from the west-southwest, contributing to the dispersion of fog and enhancing mixing in the lower atmosphere. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind direction points to a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy conditions and variable winds into the coming hours.
