Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase in the late night and early morning, peaking at very high levels, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure exhibited a rise during the middle of the period, followed by a gradual decline, signaling possible changes in atmospheric stability and potential for developing weather systems. Wind patterns shifted notably, with a transition from predominantly westerly to more variable directions, including strong northeasterly and southeasterly flows in the early morning, which may have contributed to the cooling and moisture buildup. These combined conditions point to a high likelihood of foggy and chilly conditions, especially during the early morning hours, with a possible shift toward unsettled weather later in the day.
