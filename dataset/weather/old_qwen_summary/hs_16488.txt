Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and remained consistently high, indicating a moist air mass that contributed to oppressive conditions. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry air in the latter part of the period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions in the early hours, followed by a stabilization from the east-southeast, consistent with prevailing regional flow patterns. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, stable air mass toward slightly drier and more settled weather, with minimal risk of precipitation but continued warmth and humidity into the coming period.
