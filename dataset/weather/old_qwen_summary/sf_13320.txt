Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late night, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then declined in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, with strong, westerly to southwesterly flows, which subsided later before a brief resurgence in the late evening, possibly due to localized pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a high likelihood of fog and overcast skies in the early morning, with a gradual clearing and warming trend expected as the day progresses.
