Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating potential for fog or low cloud cover during the night. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the midday hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more westerly and northwesterly directions, consistent with a developing ridge aloft. These patterns point to a transition toward clearer skies and cooler, fresher air, likely improving visibility and comfort by morning.
