Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely impacted visibility and comfort. Air pressure steadily increased, especially during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions in the afternoon, potentially influencing the movement of air masses across the city. These combined trends point to a stabilization of weather conditions, with decreasing chances of precipitation and improving outlook for the coming hours.
