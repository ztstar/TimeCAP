Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a low in the early morning before gradually rising again, indicating a strong nocturnal temperature inversion. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought the fog and cooler conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight but increased during the late morning and afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward more easterly and northeasterly sectors, consistent with a coastal upwelling or onshore flow. These combined patterns suggest the influence of maritime air masses and coastal dynamics typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for continued foggy conditions into the early part of the next day.
