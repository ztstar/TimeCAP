Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating increased moisture availability that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the latter half of the period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system approaching or settling over the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, potentially signaling the onset of a change in weather patterns or the arrival of a frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to more southeasterly suggests a reorganization of airflow, which may portend a transition toward more unstable or storm-prone conditions.
