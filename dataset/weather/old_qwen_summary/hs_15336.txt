Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation overnight, creating a muggy atmosphere, before declining sharply during the late afternoon as drier air moved in. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before stabilizing, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, suggesting a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but potentially increasing heat retention during the day.
