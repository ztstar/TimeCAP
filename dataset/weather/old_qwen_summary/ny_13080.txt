Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold, stable nocturnal period to a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a shift from damp, saturated air to drier conditions as boundary layer stability changed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved overall conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during early morning and late evening hours, with variable direction shifts from northerly to westerly, indicating dynamic atmospheric adjustments, particularly as the pressure gradient evolved. These combined trends point to a developing high-pressure dominance, likely bringing calm, dry, and relatively mild weather in the immediate forecast.
