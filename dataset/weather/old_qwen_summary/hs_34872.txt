Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a gradual cooling trend, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during the overnight period. A notable drop in humidity occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased wind speeds, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass. Wind direction transitioned from predominantly southeast to more easterly and then southeasterly, aligning with a weakening low-pressure system and potential influence from a nearby frontal boundary. The overall pattern points to a transition phase, with increasing atmospheric instability and potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
