Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, indicating a period of drying, likely due to a shift in air mass, before rebounding later in the day. Air pressure exhibited a notable decrease in the early morning, followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a weather system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased markedly during the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and variable directions, particularly from the west and northwest, signaling dynamic atmospheric conditions. These patterns collectively point to a transition from cool, moist conditions to a drier, more stable environment, with potential implications for fog dissipation and improved visibility later in the day.
