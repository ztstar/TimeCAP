Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the cooler night and early morning, peaking in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a consistent high-pressure influence that suppressed storm development. Wind activity was variable, with periods of calm and brief gusts, primarily from the west and southwest, suggesting a mix of marine air influx and local circulation patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and variable winds points to a high likelihood of fog or low clouds persisting into the morning hours, which may impact travel and outdoor activities.
