Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly around dawn. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the possible influence of a developing low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained minimal throughout most of the period, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that may signal changing air mass dynamics. These indicators collectively point to a transition in weather conditions, with the potential for increasing instability and possible thunderstorm development later in the day.
