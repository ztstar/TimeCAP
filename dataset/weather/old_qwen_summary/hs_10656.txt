Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating a shift toward a more stable and increasingly warm atmospheric profile. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before dropping abruptly, suggesting a possible frontal passage or localized convective activity that cleared the air. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief spikes linked to shifts in wind direction, including a notable shift from southerly to westerly and then easterly, which may reflect changing synoptic influences. These combined factors point to an evolving weather pattern with potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day, especially as warm, moist air accumulates under the weakening pressure system.
