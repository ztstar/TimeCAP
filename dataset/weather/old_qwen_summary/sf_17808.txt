Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the evening and overnight, peaking in the high 90s, indicating a strong likelihood of fog formation, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring prolonged overcast conditions or light precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily from late evening onward, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, reinforcing the influence of marine air inflow. These combined factors point to a persistent marine layer, likely resulting in cool, foggy conditions, particularly in the early morning hours, which can impact visibility and daily outdoor activities.
