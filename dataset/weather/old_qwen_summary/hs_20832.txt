Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of cool temperatures, with a notable dip in the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a stable but gradually rising thermal profile. Humidity remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests a transition from a saturated air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to westerly in the evening, consistent with a change in the dominant air flow pattern. These combined trends point to the dissipation of a previous moist, unstable air mass and the establishment of drier, more stable conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the near term.
