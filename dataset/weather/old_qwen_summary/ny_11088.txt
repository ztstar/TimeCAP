Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of stable, cold temperatures that began to gradually rise after reaching a minimum during the early morning hours. A sharp drop in humidity occurred during the late night and early morning, followed by a recovery in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air, possibly due to a passing front. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Strong wind gusts were observed in the early morning hours, likely associated with a frontal passage, followed by a return to calmer winds later in the day. These shifts collectively suggest a dynamic weather transition, with colder, drier air moving in, potentially setting the stage for clearer, more stable conditions in the coming hours.
