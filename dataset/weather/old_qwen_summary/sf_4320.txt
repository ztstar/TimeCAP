Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly through the night and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion. Humidity levels exhibited extreme variability, with prolonged periods of saturation followed by sharp declines, indicating intermittent fog formation and dissipation, particularly during early morning hours. Air pressure rose steadily in the late night and early morning, then fluctuated, signaling a possible shift in weather systems, potentially related to a passing front. Wind activity was generally light during most of the night and early morning, with a notable increase in gusts during the midday and late afternoon, likely driven by local topography and thermal wind effects. The combination of fluctuating humidity, decreasing temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to an unstable atmospheric environment, which may contribute to ongoing coastal fog and localized microclimatic shifts across the city.
