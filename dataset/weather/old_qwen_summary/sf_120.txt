Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before steadily declining through the night and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which coincided with increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from west to southerly and then easterly. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified again in the late afternoon, suggesting the re-establishment of coastal flow or a change in synoptic conditions. These patterns indicate a typical marine layer event, with cool, moist air dominating the region overnight and a potential for clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day.
