Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rise during the day. Humidity remained elevated throughout the night and into the early morning, peaking just before sunrise, which likely contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure exhibited a slow decline through the evening and overnight, followed by a slight increase in the late morning, indicating a possible shift in weather systems. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions together suggest the arrival of a cooler, drier air mass, potentially bringing clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
