Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting a period of fog or mist formation, followed by a significant drop as the day progressed, which aligns with the warming trend and drying out of the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early and midday hours before gradually increasing, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and easterly directions in the morning to more westerly and northerly flows later in the day, with a notable increase in wind speed during the late afternoon, possibly indicating a transition in air mass or the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Collectively, these observations suggest a dynamic shift toward drier, more stable air, with improving conditions expected in the near term, though localized gusts may persist.
