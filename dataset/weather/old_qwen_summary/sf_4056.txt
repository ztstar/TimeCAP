Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels showed significant variability, peaking in the early morning and again in the late night, suggesting the influence of fog formation and subsequent dissipation as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained consistently high, with minimal fluctuation, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of approaching storm systems. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the cooling and fog development, while wind calmed during midday before picking up again in the evening. The shift in wind direction from westward to more northeasterly in the late evening suggests a possible change in local circulation, potentially heralding the arrival of a new air mass or sea breeze pattern.
