Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period before declining steadily during the day, indicating a possible transition in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then dropped notably in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather front. Wind speed stayed low throughout the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, suggesting changing synoptic conditions. These combined trends point to a cooling trend followed by a potential change in weather patterns, possibly leading to unsettled conditions later in the day.
