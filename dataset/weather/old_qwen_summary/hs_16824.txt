Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming spike in the afternoon, indicating the influence of daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight, with a slight increase during midday, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east-southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. Together, these trends suggest a high likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or the potential for isolated convective activity in the coming hours.
