Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, beginning from a cold baseline and rising steadily into the mid-range, indicating a warming trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours before plummeting dramatically in the late morning, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass or a shift in atmospheric circulation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a significant rise toward the end of the period, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system and improving weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with dynamic weather patterns and possible frontal passage. The shift from humid, stable conditions to drier, windy, and steadily rising pressure indicates a transition toward clearer skies and potentially colder, more stable weather in the near term.
