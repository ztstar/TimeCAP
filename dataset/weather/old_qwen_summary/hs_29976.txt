Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight hours, peaking before declining in the afternoon, suggesting moisture accumulation likely tied to the front’s influence. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the nighttime and early morning, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished during the early morning, followed by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, possibly signaling a change in air mass and the potential for renewed moisture influx. Overall, the data reflects a transition from cooler, humid conditions to a more moderate and stable pattern, with implications for clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day.
