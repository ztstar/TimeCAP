Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking above 90% and remaining elevated for several hours, indicating a strong moisture influx likely associated with a frontal system. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which then dropped sharply in the early hours before rebounding again, hinting at a passing weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight period, increasing notably in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the west and northwest to the south and east, consistent with a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest that a cold front passed through the region, bringing cooler, moister air and potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
