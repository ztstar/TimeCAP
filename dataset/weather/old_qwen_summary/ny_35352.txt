Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a steady cooling phase followed by a slight回暖, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which increases the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished overnight and remained low in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northwest to near-north, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather with limited precipitation risk in the near term.
