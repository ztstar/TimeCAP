Over the past 24 hours, a noticeable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the day, reaching a low in the late afternoon before rising sharply overnight, suggesting the onset of moisture influx, possibly linked to an approaching weather system. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline through the night and early morning, with a notable drop during the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening, particularly from the southwest, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that further supports the arrival of a frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to a transition period in New York City’s weather, with increasing instability and potential for precipitation or storm activity in the near term.
