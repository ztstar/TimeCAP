Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity remained consistently high during the early and middle hours, then sharply declined in the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier, more stable air as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, peaking before declining slightly in the late afternoon, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system or an approaching disturbance. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a resurgence in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and south-southwest, potentially indicating the influence of a sea breeze or a developing local circulation. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, which could increase the risk of heat discomfort and influence afternoon thunderstorm development.
