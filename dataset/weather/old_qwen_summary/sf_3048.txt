Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity remained elevated through the night and early morning, then declined significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine layer dominance to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach or presence of a high-pressure system stabilizing conditions. Wind patterns were variable, with stronger gusts in the morning and evening, particularly from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with prevailing onshore flow and coastal wind patterns. The combination of dropping humidity, rising pressure, and reduced wind speeds in the late evening points to a likely improvement in visibility and comfort, with a shift toward more stable and pleasant conditions.
