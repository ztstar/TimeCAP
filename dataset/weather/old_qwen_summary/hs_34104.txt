Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high, peaking at saturation levels during the night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the day, suggesting improving weather conditions and the approach of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in air mass. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, which may influence afternoon thunderstorm development.
