Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating strong moisture presence likely due to marine influence. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and reduced wind speeds. Wind activity was generally light, with periods of calm and variable direction, reflecting the influence of local topography and coastal dynamics. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and cool temperatures points to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s climate, which likely led to fog and overcast conditions during the overnight hours.
