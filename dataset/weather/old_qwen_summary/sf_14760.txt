Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A drop in air pressure during the early hours coincided with the onset of high humidity, indicating the influence of a low-pressure system or marine layer intrusion. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with calm conditions early on giving way to stronger, more variable winds in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west sectors. These combined factors suggest a strong marine layer event, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, resulting in cool, foggy conditions overnight and a gradual clearing trend as the day progressed.
