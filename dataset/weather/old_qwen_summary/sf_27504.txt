Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline in the mid-morning, reaching a low before rising again in the late evening, suggesting a weakening of the coastal fog and potential clearing of the marine layer. Air pressure exhibited a steady rise through the night, peaking in the early morning, followed by a significant drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system or a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with the influence of offshore flow, while wind direction shifted notably from westerly to southerly and then back to northerly, reflecting complex local circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions later in the day.
