Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increasing moisture content in the air and potential for fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure exhibited a continuous upward trend, reaching a high plateau in the late morning and remaining stable, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to low overall, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then to southerly in the late evening, indicating a change in air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition toward clearer skies and milder conditions in the coming hours, with reduced risk of precipitation but potential for cold-related discomfort during early morning hours.
