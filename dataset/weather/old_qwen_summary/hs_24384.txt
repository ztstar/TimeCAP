Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a warming afternoon. Humidity reached near-saturation levels during the overnight period, particularly around dawn, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation, which may have reduced visibility. A notable pressure dip occurred in the early hours, followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the increased moisture and wind activity. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with shifts in direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to the passage of a frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and variable winds suggests a high potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the day progresses.
