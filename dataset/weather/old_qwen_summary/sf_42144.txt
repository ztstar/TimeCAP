Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the day, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift to more southerly and easterly wind directions, potentially signaling the arrival of a shift in air mass or an onshore flow. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no clear low-pressure system influence, but a slight rise in the latter part of the day hints at improving conditions. Overall, the data reflects a typical coastal diurnal cycle with cool, foggy mornings and a gradual clearing trend in the afternoon, which may lead to improved visibility and warmer afternoon conditions.
