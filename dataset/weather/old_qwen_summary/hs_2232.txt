Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking and remaining high through mid-morning, indicating moisture accumulation likely associated with a developing low-pressure system. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, signaling the passage of a weather front, followed by a gradual rise, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to stronger and more consistent, with a pronounced southerly flow emerging in the afternoon, which may enhance moisture transport. These conditions together point to a transition period marked by increased cloud cover and a heightened likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
