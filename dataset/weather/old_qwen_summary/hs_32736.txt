Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or drizzle during the early hours. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, settled conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, moderate temperatures, and shifting wind patterns increases the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as daytime heating intensifies.
