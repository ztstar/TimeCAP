Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly but remaining high through the morning, suggesting moist air accumulation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, with a notable drop in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with shifts in direction reflecting changing air flow patterns, particularly a shift toward more southerly and westerly winds later in the day. These trends collectively point to the influence of an approaching weather front, likely bringing overcast conditions and a potential for precipitation in the near term.
