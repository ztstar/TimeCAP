Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing and then dropping slightly, indicating possible moisture release or air mass changes. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which can bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These patterns collectively point to an evolving weather system, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
