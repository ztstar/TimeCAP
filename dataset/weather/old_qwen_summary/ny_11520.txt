Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased during the day, suggesting a warming trend, though it remained relatively cold throughout. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high humidity followed by sharp decreases, likely associated with shifting air masses and possible precipitation events. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching higher intensities, accompanied by variable wind directions, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with storm development. These combined patterns suggest the city is under the influence of an active frontal system, increasing the likelihood of rain or storms in the near term.
