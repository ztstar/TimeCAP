Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady rise, indicating a warming trend from early morning through the afternoon, followed by a slight cooling in the evening. Humidity levels remained low during the night and early morning, surged significantly in the late morning, and then dropped again during the afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and midday, peaking in the evening, which is indicative of improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, then decreased through the day before seeing a notable rise again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, hinting at changing circulation patterns. Collectively, these trends suggest the arrival of drier, more stable air associated with a strengthening high-pressure system, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
