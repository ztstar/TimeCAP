Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining, suggesting the presence of a thick coastal fog that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend in the latter half of the day, signaling a weakening of low-pressure influence and potential for clearer skies ahead. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, particularly from the southwest, consistent with offshore flow that may have contributed to fog dissipation and warmer daytime conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest in the late evening suggests a transition toward more stable, dry conditions, which could lead to improved visibility and milder temperatures overnight.
