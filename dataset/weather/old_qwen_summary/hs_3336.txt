Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting moisture accumulation during cooler periods. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined patterns point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increased moisture and instability likely to support thunderstorm development in the coming hours.
