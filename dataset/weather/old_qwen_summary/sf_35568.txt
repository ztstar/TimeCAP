Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and persisting at high levels, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical for the region during marine layer events. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the period, with a slight increase in the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to the stabilization of the marine layer. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning and stabilized in the afternoon before increasing notably toward the end of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more southwesterly flow, signaling a possible change in atmospheric dynamics. These conditions suggest that San Francisco was under the influence of a persistent marine layer, with potential for foggy mornings and clearing skies later in the day as winds strengthened and warmed the surface layer.
