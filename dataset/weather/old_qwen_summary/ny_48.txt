Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and early evening. Humidity remained consistently high during the early and late hours, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist, with a sharp drop in the midday hours followed by a gradual return to elevated levels. Air pressure showed a sustained rise, peaking and remaining stable in the latter part of the period, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm and intermittent gusts, while wind direction shifted significantly, especially during the night, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition toward clearer and drier conditions, likely bringing a more stable and comfortable atmosphere by late evening.
