Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity remained high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the midday before rebounding in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of coastal fog dissipation followed by re-moistening. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions to the region. Wind speeds were moderate overnight but diminished sharply during the late night and remained light through the morning, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the afternoon, possibly indicating a change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool coastal environment toward a clearer, more stable afternoon, consistent with the typical San Francisco weather pattern during the summer months.
