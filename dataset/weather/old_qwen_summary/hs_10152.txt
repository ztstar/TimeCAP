Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant temperature inversion overnight. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in the pre-dawn hours. A notable pressure increase in the mid-morning was followed by a steady decline, suggesting the passage of a weak front or atmospheric disturbance, possibly associated with shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the morning and remained low throughout the day, with a consistent southerly to easterly direction indicating a stable boundary layer and limited mixing. These conditions point to a tranquil, humid morning with clearing skies developing later, reducing the risk of precipitation but maintaining elevated moisture levels into the evening.
