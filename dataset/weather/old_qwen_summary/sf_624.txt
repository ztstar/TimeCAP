Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of low-level moisture and possible fog formation. A consistent drop in air pressure throughout the day, especially in the late afternoon and evening, points to an approaching weather system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a notable lull in the early hours, but increased substantially in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, possibly signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest the potential for foggy mornings and a transition toward more dynamic weather conditions, possibly including increased cloud cover or light precipitation later in the day.
