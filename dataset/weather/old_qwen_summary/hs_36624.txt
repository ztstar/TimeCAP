Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar insolation. Humidity remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight hours, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests the presence of a drying trend as surface heating intensified. Air pressure showed a steady increase, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, likely associated with the strengthening of the high-pressure system and potential for enhanced mixing in the lower atmosphere. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly sectors supports the transition toward drier, more stable air, potentially signaling the end of a moist, unstable period and a move toward more comfortable conditions.
