Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a progressively warmer day. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, reflecting saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation, before declining steadily as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a notable increase, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, shifting from a calm state to moderate breezes, with wind direction fluctuating widely—indicating dynamic air mass movements and possible frontal interactions. These combined trends point to a developing stable, dry, and increasingly warm day ahead, with reduced chances of precipitation but potential for heat accumulation as the sun rises.
