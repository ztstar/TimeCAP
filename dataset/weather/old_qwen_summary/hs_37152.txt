Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained extremely high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A consistent drop in atmospheric pressure, especially in the final hours, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and southwesterly, indicative of changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching system. These combined factors point to an elevated chance of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, with potential for localized flooding due to saturated soils and poor drainage.
