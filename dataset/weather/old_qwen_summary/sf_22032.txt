Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation before gradually decreasing, suggesting persistent moisture in the air that may have contributed to fog formation or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and diminished significantly in the early morning, with wind direction shifting toward the southwest and then more southward, consistent with a coastal breeze pattern. These combined factors point to a developing stable atmospheric regime, likely resulting in improving visibility and the dissipation of fog, with conditions trending toward a mild and clear day.
