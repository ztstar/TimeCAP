Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of coastal fog events in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor drop during the early morning hours, consistent with the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a shift in synoptic conditions. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night and into the morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, hinting at a change in airflow patterns, possibly due to a weakening of the marine layer. These combined factors point to a developing transition in the coastal weather regime, with potential for clearing skies and warming conditions later in the day.
