A notable spike in mid-period was followed by a brief correction, indicating potential profit-taking or short-term volatility, before resuming a steady climb. The most recent data point shows a slight rebound after a minor dip, signaling resilience and possible continuation of the bullish trend, though near-term consolidation may persist.
- VIX (Volatility Index): The indicator exhibited elevated volatility earlier in the period, followed by a sustained downward trend marked by a sharp decline and subsequent stabilization at lower levels. A notable spike mid-period was followed by a consistent reduction in values, suggesting a potential shift from market uncertainty to increasing investor confidence. This prolonged downtrend, particularly in the final days, may reflect reduced expectations of near-term market turbulence, though recent minor fluctuations warrant cautious monitoring for signs of renewed instability.
- Nikkei 225: The index exhibited a strong upward trend over the initial half of the period, reflecting sustained bullish momentum, followed by a consolidation phase marked by minor fluctuations.

The recent decline suggests increased volatility and possible short-term bearish pressure, warranting caution despite the prior gains.
