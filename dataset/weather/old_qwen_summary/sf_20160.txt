Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity remained consistently high, peaking at saturation levels during the night and early morning, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a continuous downward trend, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low and relatively constant throughout the day, but a notable shift in wind direction occurred in the late afternoon, with winds transitioning from predominantly northwest to southeast and then back to northwest, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a coastal fog event driven by marine layer formation, likely influenced by a weakening high-pressure ridge and the onset of a more dynamic weather pattern.
