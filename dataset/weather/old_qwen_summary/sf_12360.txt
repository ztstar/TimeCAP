Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking in the early morning and late night hours before dropping during midday, suggesting periods of fog formation followed by clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, aligning with typical coastal upwelling patterns and contributing to cooler conditions near the shoreline. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer, drier weather, with potential for increased coastal breezes and improved visibility as the high-pressure system consolidates.
