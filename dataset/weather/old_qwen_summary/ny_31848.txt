Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a low-pressure system or frontal passage. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning a slight recovery, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a weather front. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased during the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the south-southwest to the northeast, signaling a change in air mass and possible clearing skies. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and shifting winds points to a recent weather front passing through, potentially bringing the end of overcast conditions and setting the stage for more stable, clearing weather in the coming hours.
