Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the morning and afternoon hours. Humidity peaked during the early morning hours, indicating saturated conditions likely associated with fog or mist, which then sharply decreased as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase in the early morning followed by a gradual decline, suggesting an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, hinting at a change in air mass. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cool, damp, and stable night into a warmer, drier, and windier day, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary.
