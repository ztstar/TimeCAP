Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings drier, more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, likely driven by the approaching high-pressure ridge. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and a recent drop in humidity suggests a transitioning weather pattern, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
