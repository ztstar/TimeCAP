Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and nighttime hours, with stronger, more variable winds emerging from the southwest and southeast, consistent with frontal passage. These combined conditions point to a transition period marked by cooling, drying, and increasing wind activity, likely signaling the arrival of a changeable weather pattern.
