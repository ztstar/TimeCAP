Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the early hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler to moderately warmer conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening, peaking near midnight before dropping sharply, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by a drier inflow. Air pressure remained relatively stable until midday, when it dropped noticeably, then stabilized, reflecting a weakening pressure system consistent with approaching weather changes. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns point to the influence of a frontal passage, likely bringing unsettled conditions and potential for precipitation in the near term.
