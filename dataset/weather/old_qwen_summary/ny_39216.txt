Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that likely reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and eventually the south-southeast, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined trends point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing overcast skies, possible rain, and cooler conditions in the near term.
