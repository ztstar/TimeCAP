Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a transition from a moist marine layer to drier, more stable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then dropped sharply in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning hours, with a dominant westerly to northwesterly flow, which diminished during the late afternoon before picking up again in the evening with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions. The combination of falling pressure, changing wind patterns, and humidity shifts suggests the potential for developing cloud cover or precipitation later in the day, particularly if the system continues to evolve.
