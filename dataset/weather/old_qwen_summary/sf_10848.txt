Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with prolonged periods of low moisture during midday hours interrupted by sharp increases in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a generally stable pattern with minor fluctuations, but a notable drop in the early hours signaled the passage of a weak weather system, likely contributing to the changing wind and humidity patterns. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with brief periods of light to moderate flow, while wind direction shifted dramatically—particularly from southerly to westerly and then to easterly—pointing to dynamic sea breeze and synoptic influences. These conditions collectively suggest the presence of a maritime influence with a developing fog event in the early morning and a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day.
