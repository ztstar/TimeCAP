Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a daytime heating pattern. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in moisture dynamics. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the day, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system capable of bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southwesterly, indicating a change in large-scale flow that could influence storm development. These combined factors point to an environment conducive to thunderstorm activity, especially as the day transitioned into evening, warranting attention to potential convective threats.
