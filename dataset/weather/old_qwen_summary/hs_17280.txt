Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily into the afternoon, indicating a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to more variable, including southerly and northerly components, hinting at changing synoptic influences. These indicators collectively suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely reducing the risk of precipitation but potentially contributing to increased heat retention during the day.
