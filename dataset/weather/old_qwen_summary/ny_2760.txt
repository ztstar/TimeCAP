Temperatures showed a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a gradual increase, indicating a cold night transitioning into a warming morning. Humidity remained low during the overnight hours, spiking significantly in the early morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a drying trend later in the day. Air pressure exhibited a slight drop during the night, stabilizing and then rising through the morning, which may signal improving weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a peak in the final hours, driven by a shift toward more sustained and stronger winds from the northwest. The wind direction shifted from westerly to northerly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics that could influence incoming weather systems.
