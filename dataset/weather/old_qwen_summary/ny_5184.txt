Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning, peaking during the night and early dawn, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure exhibited a general downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased notably during the midday and late evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, consistent with a developing or passing low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly and then easterly supports the movement of a cold front through the region, potentially bringing cooler air and altering conditions in the coming hours.
