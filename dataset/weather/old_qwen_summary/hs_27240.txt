Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects increasing daytime heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining near saturation before gradually declining, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, with a notable spike followed by a sustained drop, pointing to the influence of a passing weather system, possibly a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then easterly, consistent with the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the onset of changing weather conditions, with potential for convective activity later in the day as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
