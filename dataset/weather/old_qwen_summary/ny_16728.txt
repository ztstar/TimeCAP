Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating the onset of a diurnal cycle typical of moderate seasonal transitions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then steadily decreased in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, particularly from the south and southeast, which may be associated with the changing pressure gradient. Wind direction shifted abruptly in the early morning, transitioning from easterly to westerly and later to southerly, indicating a reorganization of airflow that could influence cloud development and precipitation potential.
