Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a cold night with a warming trend as daylight returned. Humidity remained consistently high, reaching saturation levels during the overnight period, which contributed to foggy and damp conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in airflow associated with the advancing high-pressure front. These combined trends point to a transition from cold, foggy conditions to gradually improving and drier weather, with potential for clearer skies in the coming hours.
