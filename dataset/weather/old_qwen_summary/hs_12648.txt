Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly during the late morning and afternoon. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the night, reaching a peak in the early morning, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the early morning hours, with a notable calm period around dawn, followed by a resurgence in wind activity in the late afternoon and evening. The shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southeasterly patterns indicates a change in air mass, potentially bringing in more humid air and setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day.
