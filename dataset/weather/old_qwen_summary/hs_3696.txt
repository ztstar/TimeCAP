Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for elevated heat stress. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight and into the early morning, peaking before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass characteristics. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable increase in strength and a shift toward southerly and southeasterly directions, consistent with a developing moisture surge. These combined trends suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day, driven by warm, moist air and dynamic wind patterns.
