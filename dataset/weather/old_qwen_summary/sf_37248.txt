Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, indicating the presence of marine fog and a possible onshore breeze. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations but generally remained stable, with a minor drop in the late afternoon potentially signaling a shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest, which likely contributed to the dispersal of fog and the mixing of air masses. The combination of strong northerly winds and high humidity late in the period suggests the potential for cooler, more unstable conditions, possibly leading to increased chances of overcast skies or drizzle in the coming hours.
