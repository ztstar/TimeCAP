Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed periods of fluctuation, with marked increases in the early morning and late evening, suggesting possible frontal influences or localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief surge in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the onset of a drier, more stable air mass moving in, which could suppress convective activity and lead to clearer skies in the coming hours.
