Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early hours, suggesting the presence of stable air mass and potential for fog or dew formation, which later decreased as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the final hours, hinting at possible approaching weather changes or a weak low-pressure influence. Wind patterns showed a consistent easterly to southerly flow overnight, shifting to more variable directions in the late afternoon, with increased speeds in the evening, possibly indicating boundary layer mixing or a developing local circulation. These conditions together suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are present.
