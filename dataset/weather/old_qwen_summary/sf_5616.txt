Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, remaining elevated into the early morning before dropping slightly during the midday period, indicating a shift in air mass. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the late evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting the arrival of a coastal breeze or shift in synoptic flow. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the latter part of the day, consistent with improving or stabilizing weather conditions. These patterns point to a typical marine influence, with fog development overnight and a potential clearing trend in the afternoon, which may enhance visibility and comfort as temperatures rise.
