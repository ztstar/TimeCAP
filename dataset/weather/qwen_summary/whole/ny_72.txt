Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping to a low point before gradually rising, indicating nocturnal heat loss followed by morning warming. Humidity remained at or near saturation levels during the night and early morning, contributing to a damp, oppressive feel, before declining sharply during the midday period. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the prolonged high humidity and lack of wind. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a sudden increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, likely signaling the arrival of a frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind speed, and changing wind direction implies a dynamic atmospheric shift, potentially leading to unsettled weather conditions in the near term.
