Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature steadily declined throughout the night, reaching its lowest point before beginning a gradual recovery, suggesting a cold front passage. Humidity remained consistently high through the night, followed by a sharp decrease in the morning, signaling a transition to drier air as the system evolves. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late afternoon, with winds shifting toward more variable directions, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with storm-related circulation. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a passage of a strong cold front, likely bringing the potential for precipitation and cooler conditions in the immediate future.
