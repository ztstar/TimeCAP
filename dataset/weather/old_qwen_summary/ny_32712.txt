Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which may have contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front that likely brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to variable patterns reflects dynamic atmospheric changes, raising the possibility of unsettled weather, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
