Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, with a sharp decline in the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a steady increase, especially in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light except for brief periods of stronger gusts, particularly in the evening, associated with shifting wind directions from the south and west, hinting at possible boundary layer adjustments. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and variable wind patterns indicates a transition toward more stable and fair weather, with a lowered risk of precipitation in the near term.
