Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced nighttime cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the day, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with intermittent gusts, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the north, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, cool night into a drier, more stable daytime pattern, likely resulting in improving visibility and reduced precipitation risk.
