Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical in the region's microclimate. Air pressure showed a general increase, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilizes conditions and suppresses precipitation. Wind speeds remained low for much of the night, with brief surges in the early morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that reflect changing atmospheric dynamics near the coast. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and stable pressure supports a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to foggy conditions in coastal areas and cooler temperatures inland.
