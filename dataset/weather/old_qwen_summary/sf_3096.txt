Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modestly rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, peaking just before dawn, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting an approaching weather system. Wind conditions were strongest in the early morning, with a shift from westerly to more southerly and easterly directions by midday, potentially signaling a change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a maritime influence with cooling, high humidity, and variable wind patterns—typical of San Francisco’s microclimate—likely resulting in foggy mornings and mild conditions during the day.
