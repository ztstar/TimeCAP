Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a likely increase in fog formation. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of approaching storm systems. Wind speeds were minimal until late evening, when they increased slightly, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest toward the east-southeast, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These conditions point to a calm, fog-prone environment typical of San Francisco’s marine layer, with minimal instability and no immediate threat of precipitation or strong winds.
