Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the early morning hours, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests high moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northeasterly, hinting at the approach of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, consistent with stable atmospheric conditions, though a minor increase in wind speed was observed during the transition from night to morning. These patterns collectively suggest a period of humid, stable air with a possible shift toward more dynamic weather later in the day.
