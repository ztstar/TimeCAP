Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the approach of a weather system, possibly linked to the passage of a frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm, while wind direction shifted significantly in the early hours, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition period characterized by unstable air, potential for fog or drizzle, and increasing daytime temperatures as the system evolves.
