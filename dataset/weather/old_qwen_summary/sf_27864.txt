Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining high through mid-morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure exhibited a distinct dip during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a weakening low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased humidity and overcast conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and then northwest, signaling a possible change in air mass or the arrival of a sea breeze or frontal influence. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a stable, foggy, and cool period to a drier and slightly warmer afternoon, with potential for clearing skies as pressure stabilizes.
