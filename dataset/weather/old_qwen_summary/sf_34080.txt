Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a higher level before a slight decline in the late afternoon, pointing to a weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate and variable, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, likely due to changing pressure gradients. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a stable marine layer to a more dynamic coastal regime, potentially increasing the likelihood of patchy fog or drizzle in the early morning and clearer skies later in the day.
