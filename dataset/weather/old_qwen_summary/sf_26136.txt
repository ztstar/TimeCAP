Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating moist air persistence, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system. Wind patterns shifted from a northerly direction overnight to more variable and southerly flows in the afternoon, with sustained wind speeds during the morning and evening hours. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting wind directions points to the influence of a maritime air mass, potentially leading to foggy conditions in the early hours and a transition toward clearer skies later in the day.
