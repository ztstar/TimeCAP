Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air, likely from a nocturnal boundary layer stabilization. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and speed, pointing to the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. The wind pattern shifted from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly, with increased variability and sustained gusts in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a developing storm system. Combined with high humidity and pressure fluctuations, these conditions raise the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, warranting caution for residents.
