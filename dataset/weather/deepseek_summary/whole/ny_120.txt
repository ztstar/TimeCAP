Over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a pronounced daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before rapidly declining, suggesting a transition from a saturated, stable boundary layer to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum around mid-morning, followed by a gradual recovery—consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in the dominant airflow likely due to frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a weather front, with potential for deteriorating conditions such as precipitation or gusty winds in the near term.
