Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which is characteristic of the city's marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization of the marine layer. Wind speeds were weakest during the early morning, consistent with reduced mixing in the boundary layer, before strengthening in the evening, particularly from the west and southwest, likely facilitating the movement of coastal air masses. The combination of persistent high humidity, low temperatures, and variable wind direction points to a strong marine influence, supporting the likelihood of continued fog and cool conditions into the coming hours.
