Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking around dawn before declining steadily as temperatures rose, suggesting the onset of a drier phase. Air pressure showed a slight drop in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions, potentially associated with an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable calm period in the late night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, hinting at changing air mass influences.
