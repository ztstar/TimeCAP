Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising as the day progresses, suggesting a typical nocturnal cooling pattern followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which may have contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover during the night. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the period, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm or light winds, but increased in the late morning and afternoon, likely due to a developing thermal gradient. Wind direction shifted from west-northwest to east-southeast, signaling a change in airflow that could imply the approach of a weather front, potentially affecting conditions later in the day.
