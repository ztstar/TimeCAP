Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before beginning to rise slightly in the late morning, indicating a cool nocturnal period followed by gradual warming. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late night, which likely contributed to a damp, oppressive feel and raised the likelihood of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early hours, followed by a recovery and stabilization, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. Combined, these trends suggest a shift in weather conditions, with the potential for unsettled skies and cooler, windier conditions in the immediate future.
