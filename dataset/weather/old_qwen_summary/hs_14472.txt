Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked temperature increase, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely influenced by solar heating and urban heat retention. Humidity levels were consistently high in the early morning and overnight, peaking during the night, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased discomfort. A steady decline in air pressure was observed, especially toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind patterns showed intermittent shifts, with periods of calm followed by stronger gusts from varied directions, hinting at changing weather fronts and possible convective activity. These combined factors point to a developing atmospheric instability, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
