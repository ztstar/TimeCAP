Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation in the early morning before stabilizing, suggesting the potential for fog or mist formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and strong winds, particularly in the late night and early morning, points to deteriorating weather conditions, likely including precipitation. These indicators collectively suggest that New York City is currently under the influence of a developing storm system, which may bring rain or showers in the near term.
