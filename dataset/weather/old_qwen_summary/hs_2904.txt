A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels sharply decreased after the temperature drop, suggesting the arrival of drier air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds diminished after peaking earlier, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with the passage of a cold front. These trends collectively point to the end of a period of unsettled weather, with clearing skies and potentially cooler, drier conditions expected in the immediate aftermath.
