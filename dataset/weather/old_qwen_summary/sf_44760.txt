Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a stable and unchanging atmospheric environment, with consistent temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction across all hourly measurements. The lack of variability suggests a persistent high-pressure system dominating the region, which typically brings clear skies and calm conditions. The steady wind direction from the southeast indicates a consistent airflow, likely influenced by regional circulation patterns near the coastal fog belt. With minimal humidity and stable pressure, the likelihood of precipitation remains extremely low, reinforcing the dry and sunny conditions typical of inland or coastal high-pressure dominance. This prolonged stability may contribute to a buildup of heat during daylight hours, though the absence of significant temperature fluctuations suggests effective thermal regulation, possibly due to maritime influences.
