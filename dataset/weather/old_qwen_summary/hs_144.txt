Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon as air masses shifted. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting the passage of a cold front, which may have initiated the temperature drop and humidity change. The cessation of wind and shift in direction toward the west and southwest in the afternoon, along with falling pressure, hints at a weakening of the front and potential for more variable conditions later in the day.
