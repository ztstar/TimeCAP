Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog or low clouds, which likely suppressed daytime warming, but dropped sharply in the afternoon, coinciding with a significant rise in temperature. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the late morning, followed by a steady decline, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system or the passage of a front. Wind patterns showed a shift from light, variable flow during the night to stronger, more consistent winds from the east and southeast in the afternoon, potentially driving the clearing of fog and promoting warmer conditions. The combination of rising temperatures, dropping humidity, and sustained winds suggests a transition to clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, typical of the onset of a sunny afternoon in San Francisco’s microclimate.
