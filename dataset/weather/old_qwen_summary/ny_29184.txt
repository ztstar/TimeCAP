Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise toward midday, indicating the passage of a cold front and subsequent warming. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early night, accompanied by a sharp decline in air pressure, which suggests the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly in the late evening, consistent with changing frontal dynamics. The sustained high humidity and falling pressure in the early hours correlate with precipitation likelihood, potentially resulting in rain or drizzle during the night. As pressure stabilized and temperatures began to rise, conditions are now trending toward clearer skies, though lingering moisture may support fog or mist in the early morning hours.
