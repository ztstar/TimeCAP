Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a steady decline through the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming, suggesting the influence of a frontal passage and subsequent air mass change. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which increases the likelihood of fog or precipitation. Wind direction shifted from near-northerly to southeasterly and then to southerly, consistent with the movement of a cyclonic system bringing in moist, unstable air. With wind speeds remaining consistently low and pressure stabilizing toward the end of the period, conditions may be transitioning toward a more settled state, though lingering moisture could support scattered showers.
