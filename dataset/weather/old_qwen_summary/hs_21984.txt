Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the period, peaking in the early hours and persisting at high levels, indicating a saturated atmosphere conducive to potential condensation or fog. Air pressure showed a slight rise in the midday hours, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting a possible weak low-pressure system influence later in the cycle. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southeast to south-southwest, indicating a change in airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, rising wind speeds, and shifting pressure suggests the potential for unstable conditions, possibly leading to isolated thunderstorms or heavy showers later in the night.
