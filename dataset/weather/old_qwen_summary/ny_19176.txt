Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely due to the influx of colder air. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike during the early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation that may have contributed to fog or light precipitation. Air pressure dropped sharply in the late evening, followed by a sustained low-pressure system, which often correlates with unsettled weather, including storms or rain. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning and remained elevated through the night, with a consistent shift toward the northwest, indicating a strong northerly flow bringing cold air into the region. These combined factors suggest that New York City experienced a transition into colder, more unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of winter weather such as snow or freezing rain.
