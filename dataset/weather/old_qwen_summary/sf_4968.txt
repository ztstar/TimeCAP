Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate during the early and late hours, with a notable reduction during the early morning and a surge in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted significantly, transitioning from westerly to more southerly and then to easterly, reflecting complex local flow patterns influenced by the coastal topography and synoptic-scale weather systems.
