Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking before beginning to subside, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to nighttime cooling and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, peaking in the mid-day and evening, which may indicate the influence of a weak high-pressure system or a developing weather front. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases during the night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from predominantly northwest to more variable patterns, hinting at changing air mass influences. Together, these trends suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid nocturnal period toward a milder and drier day, with little indication of significant storm activity but potential for localized fog or mist early in the morning.
