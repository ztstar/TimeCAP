Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle, with a significant cooling trend during the night followed by a steady warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited marked swings, remaining high during early morning and late evening hours, then dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a mix of marine influence and inland air mass changes. Air pressure showed a general rise through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a possible passing frontal system or atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by a developing sea breeze or pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to more variable patterns suggests changing airflow dynamics, potentially signaling a transition in weather conditions.
