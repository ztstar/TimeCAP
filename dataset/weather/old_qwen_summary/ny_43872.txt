Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a stable night-time temperature drop and a steady recovery during the day. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with the development of a frontal system. Combined, these patterns point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increasing chances of precipitation and gusty winds in the near term.
