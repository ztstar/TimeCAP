Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period before dropping significantly in the morning, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and a significant reduction in wind speed, which may have signaled the passage of a weather front. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong, consistent winds from the northwest during the early morning giving way to calm and variable conditions, followed by a resurgence of wind from the west and northwest in the late evening. These changes indicate the influence of a transient atmospheric disturbance, likely contributing to localized fog and cool conditions, with potential for clearing skies and improving visibility as the system passes.
