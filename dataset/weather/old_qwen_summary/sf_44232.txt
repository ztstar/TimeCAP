Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a transition from a cool, stable nighttime period to a progressively warmer daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover, which is characteristic of the city’s microclimate. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly and westerly, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west-southwest, which may indicate the onset of a marine layer push or an influence from an approaching front. These patterns collectively suggest that San Francisco is transitioning through a period of dynamic coastal weather, with potential for fog dissipation during the day and the possibility of overcast or light precipitation later in the day.
