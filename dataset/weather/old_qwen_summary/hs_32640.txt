Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to increased cloud cover and reduced visibility during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night and early morning, increasing steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southwesterly, which may indicate changing atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds suggests a transition toward more stable, drier conditions, potentially clearing skies and reducing the risk of localized thunderstorms.
