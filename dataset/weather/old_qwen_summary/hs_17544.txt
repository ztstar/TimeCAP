Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend overnight with a return to milder conditions in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning hours, which contributed to a persistent muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry air aloft. Wind speeds rose significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, suggesting the approach of a changing air mass. These combined factors point to a transition in weather patterns, with the potential for clearing skies and improved conditions in the coming hours.
