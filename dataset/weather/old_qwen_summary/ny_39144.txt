Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a cold front passing through. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early hours but sharply increased in the late evening, suggesting moisture accumulation likely tied to a developing frontal boundary. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing at a low level, which is characteristic of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with sustained stronger winds from the west to northwest, consistent with frontal passage and potential storm development. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increased wind suggests a high likelihood of deteriorating weather conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
