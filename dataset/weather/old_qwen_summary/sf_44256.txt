Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling period likely influenced by marine layer formation. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting dense fog or low cloud cover, which diminished later in the day as temperatures rose and moisture levels declined. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds showed a notable spike in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of offshore flow and the dissipation of coastal fog. Taken together, these trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a drier, clearer day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
