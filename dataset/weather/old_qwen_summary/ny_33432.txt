Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend overnight and subsequent warming during daylight. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests a clearing trend as the air became drier. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly, consistent with a changing frontal system. These indicators collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, likely leading to clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
