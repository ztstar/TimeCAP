Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, particularly during late night and early morning, suggesting conditions favorable for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through, though a slight rise in the late afternoon may hint at subsidence or clearing trends. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight hours and again in the late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwest to northeast, potentially signaling the influence of a local pressure gradient or boundary layer changes. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable and humid conditions, with a possible increase in discomfort due to high heat index values as temperatures rise during the day.
