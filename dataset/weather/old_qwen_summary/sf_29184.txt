Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through midday before declining again, indicating a possible marine influence or fog development. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern with a marked drop in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the cooler and more humid conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, potentially enhancing coastal fog and contributing to the observed temperature variations. The combination of shifting wind directions and pressure changes points to dynamic coastal weather patterns, likely driven by a sea breeze cycle and frontal activity affecting the region.
