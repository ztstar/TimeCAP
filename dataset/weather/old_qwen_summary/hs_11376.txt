Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the morning hours, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near dawn before plummeting to very low values in the mid-morning, suggesting a dry air mass influence or a recent passing of a frontal boundary. Air pressure showed a notable decrease around midnight, followed by a recovery and fluctuation, which may indicate a passing weather system or localized atmospheric instability. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and a shift in wind direction consistent with changing air mass patterns. The combination of low humidity, temperature rebound, and shifting wind direction suggests a transition from a stable, moist nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially increasing fire risk and discomfort.
