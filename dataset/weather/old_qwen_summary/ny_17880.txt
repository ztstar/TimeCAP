Temperature showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating a period of saturated air, followed by a significant drop as temperatures increased, suggesting drier conditions in the afternoon. Air pressure remained stable through the night and morning, then rose sharply in the midday, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest, which may indicate a change in airflow patterns. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a damp, stable night to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic afternoon, with potential for improving conditions in the coming hours.
