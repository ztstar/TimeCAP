Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, coinciding with a period of increased cloudiness and potential for precipitation, though no rain was recorded. Wind speeds increased during midday and into the evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and westerly, consistent with a possible boundary passage or change in synoptic flow. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather patterns, possibly signaling the approach of a frontal system or a change in air mass, which could lead to unsettled conditions in the near term.
