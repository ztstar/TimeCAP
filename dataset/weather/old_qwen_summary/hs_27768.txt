Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, then plummeted during the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass or convective activity that transported moisture upward. A notable pressure drop occurred around midday, accompanied by a spike in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, which may signal the approach or passage of a frontal system. The sustained high wind speeds and strong directional shifts in the afternoon point to dynamic atmospheric conditions, potentially increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms or gusty winds. These combined indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the potential for unstable conditions and possible severe weather later in the day.
