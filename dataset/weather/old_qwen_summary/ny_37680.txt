Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained nearly stable throughout most of the period, with a slight rise in the early morning followed by a gradual drop, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in airflow, possibly from a developing weather front. Combined, these trends point to a transition period in the city’s weather, with potential for precipitation and deteriorating conditions later in the day.
