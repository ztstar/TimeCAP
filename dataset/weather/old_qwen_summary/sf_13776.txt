Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the day, suggesting the presence of fog formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, which typically signals the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, diminishing through the night and remaining light during the day, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, consistent with changing airflow patterns near the coast. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cool, damp, and foggy night to a milder, clearer, and more stable day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
