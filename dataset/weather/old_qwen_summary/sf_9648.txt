Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to the fog and cooler temperatures. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more westerly direction in the late evening, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a period of marine layer dominance, likely resulting in foggy mornings and mild daytime temperatures, characteristic of San Francisco’s coastal weather patterns.
