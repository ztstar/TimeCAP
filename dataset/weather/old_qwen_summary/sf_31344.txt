Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during midday, only to surge again late in the period, indicating possible fog or low cloud development. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the final few hours, suggesting an approaching weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds were highest during the early and late hours, with strong, consistent winds from the west to northwest sector, which likely contributed to cooling and moisture transport. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the final hours, combined with the pressure drop and humidity spike, points to a developing maritime influence or a change in synoptic conditions that may bring overcast skies or precipitation.
