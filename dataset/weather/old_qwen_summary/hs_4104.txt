Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or dew, contributing to a muggy and oppressive feel. A consistent drop in air pressure throughout the night, particularly during the early morning, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, signaling a possible shift in air mass and potential for thunderstorm development. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened risk of isolated or scattered thunderstorms in the coming hours.
