Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning. Humidity levels rose notably during the late night and early morning hours, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, later subsiding to lighter, more variable winds from the south and southeast. The overall pattern points to a transition from a cooler, moist air mass to a drier, more stable environment, likely resulting in improving weather conditions with reduced chances of precipitation.
