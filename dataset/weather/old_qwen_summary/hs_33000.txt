Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from nocturnal low temperatures to daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to increased fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent rise, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon, pointing toward improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind patterns displayed a shift from southerly to easterly and later to westerly flows, with peak gusts occurring in the late evening, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a developing fair-weather pattern, though residual moisture and variable winds may still pose a risk for isolated afternoon showers.
