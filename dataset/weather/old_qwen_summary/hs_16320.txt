Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before steadily declining through the day, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during midday, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly across the morning, potentially indicating a change in airflow associated with a passing front. Overall, the data points to a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, warming day under a weakening high-pressure influence, with minimal risk of precipitation or severe weather.
