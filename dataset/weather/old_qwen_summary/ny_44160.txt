Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating a strong influence of nighttime radiative cooling or an approaching cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours before dropping dramatically during midday, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, potentially more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially in the latter part of the period, pointing to the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors, consistent with a change in air mass and possible frontal passage. The combination of falling temperatures, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
