Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that began in the early morning and continued through the night. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours, suggesting moist air accumulation, which may contribute to increased fog or dew formation. Air pressure dropped significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a low before a slight rebound, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the north and northeast, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, likely bringing overcast skies, increased chance of precipitation, and potentially cooler conditions in the coming hours.
