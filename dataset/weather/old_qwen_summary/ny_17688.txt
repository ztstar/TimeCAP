Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, potentially increasing wind chill and affecting outdoor activities. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly suggests a possible change in air mass, which may signal the approach of a new weather pattern by the coming day.
