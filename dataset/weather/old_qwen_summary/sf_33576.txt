Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the early hours, peaked in the midday, then sharply declined in the evening, indicating the arrival of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from the west and northwest, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, consistent with an approaching marine influence or storm system. These changes collectively point to a transition in weather patterns, likely bringing overcast conditions and a higher risk of light rain or fog in the coming hours.
