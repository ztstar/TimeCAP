Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours, indicating strong moisture accumulation, likely due to coastal fog formation and low-level condensation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has since stabilized. Wind speeds diminished significantly after midnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast during the late morning hours, signaling a change in atmospheric flow possibly linked to a coastal breeze reversal. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer to a drier and more variable regime, with potential for clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day.
