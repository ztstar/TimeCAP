Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather. Temperature gradually increased through the day, suggesting warming trends likely linked to the influx of moist air. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours and remained consistently high, creating a muggy and oppressive atmosphere. Wind speeds intensified notably in the afternoon, with sustained strong gusts from the southeast to south-southwest directions, consistent with storm development. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of precipitation and potentially severe weather conditions in the near term.
