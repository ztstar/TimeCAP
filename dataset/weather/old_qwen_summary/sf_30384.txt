Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A significant increase in air pressure coincided with a shift in wind patterns, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that brought clearer skies and drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southwest, likely due to a developing offshore flow. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and shifting wind directions points to the influence of marine layer dynamics and a transition toward more stable, sunny conditions by late evening.
