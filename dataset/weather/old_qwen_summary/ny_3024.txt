Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning before sharply declining during midday, suggesting a drying trend associated with changing air mass conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified through the morning and afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the evening, coupled with the rising pressure and dropping humidity, indicates the passage of a frontal boundary and the likelihood of clearer, more stable conditions in the near term.
