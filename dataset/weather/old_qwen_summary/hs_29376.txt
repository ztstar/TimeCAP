Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, potentially more unstable air. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the midday and early evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, driven by a shift to stronger northerly and westerly flows, which may have facilitated the mixing of air masses and the dissipation of low-level moisture. These combined factors point to a developing pattern of daytime heating, nocturnal cooling, and increasing wind-driven dispersion—conditions that could influence local air quality and potentially set the stage for convective activity later in the day.
