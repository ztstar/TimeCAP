Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low-level cloud cover. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a period of fluctuating but generally decreasing pressure, indicating the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined signals point to a developing front moving through the region, likely bringing cooler temperatures and possible precipitation in the near term.
