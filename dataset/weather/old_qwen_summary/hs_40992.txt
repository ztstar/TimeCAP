Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained persistently high overnight, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation, with a sharp drop in moisture during the midday hours. Air pressure showed a fluctuating but generally rising pattern, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and peaked in the evening, with a shift toward more variable and stronger southerly to westerly flows, which could signal the approach of a weather front. These combined trends suggest the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, possibly leading to thunderstorm development as warm, moist air continues to build.
