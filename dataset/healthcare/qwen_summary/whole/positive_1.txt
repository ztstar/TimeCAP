Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both the number of specimens tested and the proportion of positive cases increasing significantly. The proportion of positive specimens has more than doubled in recent weeks, indicating a sharp rise in community transmission, with the most pronounced growth occurring in the last 6–8 weeks. Influenza A has consistently contributed the majority of positive cases, but Influenza B has demonstrated a strong and steady increase, suggesting co-circulation with potential for heightened seasonal impact. The ratios for both virus types have shown exponential growth in the final weeks, signaling a possible peak in the current influenza wave. This surge in activity underscores the urgent need for heightened surveillance, public health messaging, and vaccination efforts to mitigate severe outcomes.
