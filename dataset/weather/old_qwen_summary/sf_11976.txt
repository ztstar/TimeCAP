Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, with conditions reaching saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating significant moisture presence in the atmosphere. Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase was followed by solar heating. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, particularly around midday, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, but increased in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and easterly patterns, potentially indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition in weather conditions, with persistent fog and dampness likely contributing to a cool, overcast environment, and the pressure drop may portend unsettled weather in the near term.
