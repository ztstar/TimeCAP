Temperature showed a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a steady rise during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting dry air advection, which may contribute to reduced cloud formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking midday before gradually declining, signaling a high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with consistent southerly and westerly flows early on, shifting to more variable directions later, possibly indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving weather conditions, with a reduced chance of precipitation and increasing comfort levels during the day.
