Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising again, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend during the night and warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during the cool hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase in the early morning hours followed by a gradual decline, indicating a stable high-pressure system that may have been weakening. Wind patterns shifted notably during the night, with a transition from westerly to northerly and then easterly flows, accompanied by increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon, which could signal the approach of a frontal system. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and changing wind direction in the evening suggests a potential change in weather conditions, possibly bringing cooler, drier air or an impending shift in atmospheric dynamics.
