Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity spiked during the early hours, remained elevated through mid-morning, then dropped sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist to dry conditions. Air pressure rose steadily overnight, peaked in the early hours, then experienced a significant drop in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to westerly, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a weather front, potentially bringing instability and the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
