Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually beginning to rise, indicating a significant cooling trend followed by a slow recovery. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours before sharply decreasing, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, followed by a slight decline, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speed remained constant throughout the period, with wind direction consistently from the southwest, implying stable airflow from a consistent source. These combined trends point to a clearing trend after a cold, damp night, likely leading to improving conditions with a chance of partly sunny skies in the coming hours.
