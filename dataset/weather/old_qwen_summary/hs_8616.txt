Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the daytime, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a marked drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a brief increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined signals suggest a developing weather shift, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development due to warming and residual moisture.
