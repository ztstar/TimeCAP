Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained consistently high in the early period, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the later hours, particularly from the northwest and west, signaling stronger atmospheric instability and potential for shifting weather. Combined with the wind direction shift from southerly to westerly and northerly, these trends point to the influence of a developing frontal system, which may bring precipitation or thunderstorms in the near future.
