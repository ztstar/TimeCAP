Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to increased cloud cover and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, especially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more westerly and southerly directions, which may facilitate the influx of warm, moist air. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern conducive to thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day or overnight.
