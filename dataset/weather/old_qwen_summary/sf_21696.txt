Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a damp, foggy period to clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight drop toward the end of the period, suggesting the possible influence of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from a northwest to a more southerly direction. These trends point to the dissipation of marine layer fog and the arrival of warmer, drier air, likely signaling improved visibility and more comfortable conditions for the remainder of the day.
