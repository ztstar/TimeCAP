Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again through the late day. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night, particularly during the coolest hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-lying cloud cover, which is typical of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure exhibited a strong peak in the early morning, followed by a sharp decline and fluctuating patterns, indicating the passage of a weather front that may have brought in maritime air. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief periods of calm and minor gusts, though directional shifts—from southwesterly to northerly and then easterly—suggest changing airflow patterns associated with the frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition from cooler, moist marine conditions to a gradual return of drier, warmer air, likely signaling a shift toward clearer skies later in the day.
