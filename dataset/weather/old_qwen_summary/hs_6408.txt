Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining through the morning, indicating a transition from a more saturated air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, reaching a peak in the early morning, then fluctuated slightly, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, shifting from a southerly direction to more westerly and then northerly patterns, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially signaling improving weather conditions later in the day.
