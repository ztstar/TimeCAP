Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a cold but stable overnight period followed by a modest warming trend. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air infiltration, before rebounding slightly in the afternoon, which may point to localized moisture influx. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate and generally decreased toward the end of the period, with wind direction shifting from northwest to west-southwest, indicating a change in flow associated with the high-pressure buildup. Combined, these patterns suggest improving weather with cooler temperatures, drier air, and decreasing wind, favoring clear to partly cloudy conditions in New York City.
