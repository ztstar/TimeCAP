Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking and remaining high through the early morning, which suggests increased moisture in the atmosphere and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, though residual moisture and wind shifts could still support isolated showers later in the period.
