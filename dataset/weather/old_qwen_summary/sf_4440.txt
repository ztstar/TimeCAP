Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early afternoon and remained strong through the evening, with persistent southerly to southwesterly flow, likely enhancing coastal upwelling and contributing to cooler surface temperatures. The combination of high humidity, strong winds, and elevated pressure suggests a classic marine layer pattern, common in San Francisco, which may continue to produce foggy mornings and cool, crisp evenings.
