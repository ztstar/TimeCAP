Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal thermal dynamics. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of marine layer development and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent increase, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach or passage of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low and consistent, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, characteristic of a land-sea breeze pattern. These combined factors point to a calm, fog-prone morning transitioning into a clearer, slightly warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
