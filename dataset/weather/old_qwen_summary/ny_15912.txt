Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, suggesting increasing chances of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions. Temperature trends show a cooling pattern overnight followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, reflecting typical diurnal variation with a notable rise in the late afternoon. Relative humidity peaked during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through the night and into the early morning, which increases the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with the development of a frontal boundary. Combined, these indicators point to a dynamic weather shift, with potential for showers or thunderstorms in the near term, particularly as the wind direction shifts toward the southwest, bringing in moist, unstable air.
