Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon. A sharp drop in air pressure in the late night and early morning coincided with a marked increase in humidity, culminating in saturation levels and persistent fog or low cloud cover. The wind shifted from a southerly to a more northerly direction, with a notable increase in speed during the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a frontal system. The sustained high humidity and falling pressure indicate a high likelihood of precipitation, particularly during the overnight hours. These conditions point to a dynamic atmospheric setup that could lead to thunderstorms or heavy rain as the system evolves.
