Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, starting high in the night and morning, plummeting during midday, then rising again in the evening—suggesting the influence of fog dissipation and subsequent onshore flow. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a notable low around midday, followed by a recovery, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front or shifting sea breeze patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger and more variable winds from multiple directions, particularly from the northwest and south, consistent with the development of a coastal wind event. These combined patterns point to a transition from a foggy, stable coastal environment to a more dynamic, gusty regime, likely driven by a coastal upwelling event or synoptic-scale pressure gradient change.
