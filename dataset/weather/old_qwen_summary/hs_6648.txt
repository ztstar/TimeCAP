Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a strong daytime heating phase. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the overnight hours, particularly in the early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to reduced temperatures and stable atmospheric conditions. A notable rise in air pressure occurred midday, peaking in the late afternoon before a sharp decline, which may signal the approach of a changing weather system or a passing front. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly and then northerly, reflecting dynamic changes in local circulation. These combined indicators suggest a transition in weather patterns, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day, including possible thunderstorm development.
