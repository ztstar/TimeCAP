Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, rising slightly in the afternoon, suggesting increasing moisture content as temperatures stabilized. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, pointing to a change in airflow likely associated with the high-pressure influence. Overall, the data suggests improving conditions with drier, cooler air and decreasing wind, conducive to clear skies and comfortable weather in New York City.
