Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure showed a steady increase during the morning and early afternoon, followed by a sudden drop in the evening, suggesting a possible change in weather systems approaching the region. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a shift to more consistent northerly and westerly winds during the late afternoon, indicating a transition in wind patterns possibly tied to coastal dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer event, with cooling, high humidity, and wind shifts characteristic of San Francisco’s coastal climate, potentially leading to foggy mornings and mild, stable conditions through the day.
