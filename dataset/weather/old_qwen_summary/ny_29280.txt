Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining significantly, indicating a persistent cold air mass over the region. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting periods of fog or dew formation followed by drying conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift toward more northerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with a strengthening high-pressure ridge. Taken together, these indicators suggest a transition toward colder, drier, and more stable conditions, likely resulting in clear skies and reduced precipitation risk in the immediate forecast.
