Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rebound in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal pattern likely driven by coastal fog dissipation and afternoon warming. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, then declined rapidly in the afternoon, suggesting the clearing of marine layer fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight decline in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weak frontal system or change in air mass. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning and late afternoon, with a brief increase in the early morning hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from northwest to northeast, reflecting the influence of local topography and coastal circulation. The overall pattern points to a typical San Francisco weather cycle, with cool, foggy mornings transitioning into warmer, drier afternoons, consistent with a marine layer regime breaking down under increasing insolation.
