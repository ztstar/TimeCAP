Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature dip and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a generally stable yet fluctuating pattern, with a sustained increase during the midday and late afternoon, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that may be bringing drier and clearer conditions. Wind patterns were highly variable, with strong gusts in the early morning and late evening, particularly from the west and southwest, likely driven by coastal breezes and topographic effects. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a drier, more stable environment, with potential for improving visibility and sunshine in the coming hours.
