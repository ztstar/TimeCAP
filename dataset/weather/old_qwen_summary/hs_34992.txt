Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more convective daytime regime. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a peak in the late afternoon, which often signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a dramatic shift in wind direction from west-northwest to east-northeast, indicating a change in large-scale flow, possibly linked to a developing sea breeze or frontal influence. These combined factors suggest the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate under a stabilizing high-pressure dome.
