Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup and eventual dispersion as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then showed a gradual decline in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind patterns evolved from a consistent southerly to easterly flow in the early hours, transitioning to a more northerly and then westerly direction by late evening, potentially indicating a change in airflow associated with a developing frontal influence. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, with high morning moisture and warming conditions in the afternoon creating favorable conditions for afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the observed wind shifts and pressure trends.
