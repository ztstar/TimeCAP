Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a stable plateau during the night, followed by a slight rise in the early morning and a gradual decline later in the day, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased slightly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that indicates changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, with clearing skies and improving visibility likely as the day progresses, potentially leading to a more stable and pleasant afternoon.
