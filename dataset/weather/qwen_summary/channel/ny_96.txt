- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a significant decline over the past 24 hours, beginning with stable to high readings in the early period before dropping sharply in the latter half. A notable anomaly occurred with a peak in the early hours, followed by a prolonged and steep decrease, indicating a possible shift in air mass or atmospheric conditions. This trend suggests the arrival of drier air, which could influence comfort levels and potentially affect local weather patterns such as fog dissipation or precipitation likelihood.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has shown a sustained downward trend over the past 24 hours, beginning with stable readings before a gradual and consistent decline. The most significant drop occurred in the final six hours, indicating a possible approaching weather system, likely associated with low-pressure development. This pattern suggests increasing instability in the atmosphere, which may be linked to deteriorating weather conditions such as precipitation or wind shifts.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, reaching a minimum before sharply increasing during the mid-to-late morning, peaking in the afternoon, and subsequently cooling through the evening. The rapid rise and fall suggest a strong diurnal pattern, likely influenced by solar heating and atmospheric conditions typical of urban environments. The brief overshoot in the afternoon followed by a gradual drop indicates a transition from daytime heating to nocturnal cooling, consistent with expected thermal dynamics in New York City.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a period of near-still conditions early in the timeframe, followed by a sustained increase in variability and intensity, peaking in the latter half. A notable surge occurred during the final hours, indicating a strengthening wind event that may suggest evolving atmospheric dynamics. The recurring low values interspersed with brief bursts of higher speeds suggest intermittent gusts, potentially influenced by localized weather phenomena or topographical effects.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction has exhibited significant variability over the past 24 hours, transitioning from consistent northerly to westerly flows before shifting abruptly to southerly and easterly sectors. A notable shift occurred around the 12th hour, marked by a rapid change from a prevailing westerly pattern to a southerly direction, suggesting the passage of a weather front or change in atmospheric pressure systems. The frequent return to near-zero degrees—indicating variable or calm conditions—early and late in the period implies periods of stalled airflow, which may contribute to localized stagnation or dispersion challenges.
