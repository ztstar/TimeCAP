Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels spiked during the night, indicating moist air infiltration, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a brief rise, signaling possible atmospheric instability and the potential for developing storms. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly light and variable to stronger southeasterly flow in the evening, suggesting an influx of maritime air. These combined factors point to an increased likelihood of scattered thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to interact with the weakening pressure system.
