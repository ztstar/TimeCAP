Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping and then rebounding sharply in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a maritime air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds intensified in the final hours, particularly in the last few hours, with a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, indicating a change in synoptic flow likely associated with a developing coastal breeze or frontal influence. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period in the local weather, potentially leading to overcast skies and a higher chance of fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
