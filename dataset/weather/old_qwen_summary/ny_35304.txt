Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, indicating stable, moist air masses that contributed to persistent cloud cover and reduced visibility. A gradual temperature decline during the early morning hours was followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, signaling a transition from a cool, damp morning to a warmer, drier afternoon. Air pressure showed a steady decrease through the night and early morning, culminating in a low-pressure trough, which typically precedes stormy or unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a southerly to easterly flow early in the cycle giving way to a more northerly direction later, suggesting a change in large-scale circulation. These combined trends point to an approaching weather system, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
