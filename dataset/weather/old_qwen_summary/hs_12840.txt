Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests strong moisture accumulation, likely due to low-level convergence and possibly the presence of a boundary layer inversion. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a slight recovery, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger gusts from the southeast and south, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the approaching disturbance. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly patterns indicates a change in circulation, consistent with the development of a maritime-influenced air mass, raising the potential for instability and thunderstorm activity later in the day.
