Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near or at saturation levels during the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature depression. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the mid-morning and stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has since brought more stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm periods around dawn, but increased slightly in the afternoon, likely due to a shift in local circulation patterns. The wind direction underwent a notable reversal in the early morning, shifting from southwest to northeast, which may reflect a change in synoptic flow and could signal the arrival of a new air mass.
