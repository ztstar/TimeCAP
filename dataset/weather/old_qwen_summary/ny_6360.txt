Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a significant daytime warming, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests high moisture content in the lower atmosphere and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southerly again, indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing frontal boundary. These combined trends point to an evolving weather scenario, with an increased likelihood of precipitation and possible storms as the low-pressure system moves closer to the region.
