The weather in San Francisco has remained exceptionally stable over the past 24 hours, with no significant fluctuations observed in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent atmospheric conditions suggest a prolonged period of high-pressure dominance, which typically brings clear skies and dry air. The persistent wind from the southeast indicates a steady flow, likely influenced by regional pressure gradients. With low humidity levels and stable temperatures, the city has experienced dry, comfortable conditions typical of a summer inland pattern, despite its coastal location. This stable regime is expected to continue, minimizing the risk of precipitation or sudden weather changes in the near term.
