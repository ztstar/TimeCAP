Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both influenza A and B subtypes demonstrating sharp increases in positivity rates, particularly in recent weeks. The proportion of positive specimens has nearly tripled in the last five weeks, indicating a significant surge in community transmission, likely entering a peak phase of the seasonal outbreak. Influenza A has consistently driven the majority of cases, but the concurrent rise in Influenza B suggests a broader and more complex circulation pattern across age groups. The doubling of positivity rates in the most recent weeks, especially among younger populations, raises concerns about potential strain on healthcare resources and the need for intensified public health interventions. Given the current trajectory, continued monitoring and proactive measures such as vaccination campaigns and early treatment protocols are essential to mitigate severe outcomes.
