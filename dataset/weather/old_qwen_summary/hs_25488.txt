Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture layer that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure declined notably during the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may reflect the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a boundary influence. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the influence of a developing local circulation. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with potential for isolated afternoon convection if moisture returns.
