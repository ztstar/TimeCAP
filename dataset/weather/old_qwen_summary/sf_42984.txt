Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the morning, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight rise in the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that helped maintain clear conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were low during the night, with a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the late morning, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures overnight, and a shift in wind patterns points to the likelihood of persistent low clouds or fog in coastal areas, which is typical for San Francisco’s microclimate.
