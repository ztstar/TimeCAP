Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming in the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a mild recovery. Humidity remained high during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility. Air pressure increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours but strengthened in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, potentially indicating a change in airflow patterns. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cold, damp, and calm night to a gradually warming and drier day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
