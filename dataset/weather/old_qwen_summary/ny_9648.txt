Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained relatively stable through the night before rising sharply in the early morning, indicating a shift in air mass, likely associated with a developing weather system. A notable and abrupt decrease in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with frontal activity. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to an active weather front influencing the region, potentially leading to precipitation or unstable conditions in the near term.
