Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before a dramatic decline in the afternoon, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation followed by dry air advection. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the midday, coinciding with a spike in wind speeds and a shift toward more variable wind directions, which may signal the passage of a weather system or localized storm activity. The wind behavior showed a distinct pattern: calm conditions early and late, with strong gusts in the afternoon, likely driven by convective instability or a passing front. These combined indicators point to a dynamic atmospheric environment, potentially conducive to thunderstorms, especially in the afternoon and early evening hours.
