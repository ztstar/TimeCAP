Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking at saturation during several periods, which likely contributed to the formation of low-lying fog and reduced visibility, characteristic of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor dips in the late evening, indicating a steady atmospheric regime with no significant storm systems approaching. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, especially from the west and southwest, suggesting stronger onshore flow that may have brought in cooler marine air and enhanced fog dispersion. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast later in the period hints at a potential change in air mass, possibly signaling the end of a fog-prone regime and a transition toward clearer, drier conditions.
