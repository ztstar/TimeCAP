Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a shift toward more stable and warmer conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level cloud cover and a heightened chance of localized showers. Air pressure remained relatively high through the night and early morning, then gradually declined toward the end of the period, signaling a potential approaching weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with the development of a boundary layer circulation. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward a more humid and potentially unsettled weather regime, with increased risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
