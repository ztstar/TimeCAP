Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early hours, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure gradually increased, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, drier conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, shifting from a southerly direction to more easterly and northeasterly flows, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, stagnant night into a drier, more ventilated day, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but increasing comfort levels as the evening progressed.
