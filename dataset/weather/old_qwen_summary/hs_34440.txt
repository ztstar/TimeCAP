Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating strong moisture presence, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual rise, peaking in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally supports stable, fair weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to more southerly and then easterly, hinting at a change in air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by a transition to drier, more stable conditions, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and warmer temperatures in the coming hours.
