Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at 100% during the early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before a slight recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from southerly to easterly directions, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a moist, unstable air mass moving through the region, increasing the potential for localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
