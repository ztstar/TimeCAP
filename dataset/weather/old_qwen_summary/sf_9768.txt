Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night, reaching a low point in the early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind activity was minimal overall, with brief bursts during the night and early morning, primarily from the northwest and later shifting to the southeast, suggesting a change in wind patterns. These conditions point to a coastal fog event likely driven by temperature inversion and marine layer development, which could persist into the next day with potential for reduced visibility and cool, damp conditions.
