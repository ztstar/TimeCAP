Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning to decline, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity but consistent atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which may signal a change in air mass. These conditions collectively point to a period of marine influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with foggy, cool mornings and a gradual clearing trend in the late day.
