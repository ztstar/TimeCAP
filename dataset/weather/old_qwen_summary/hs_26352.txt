Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation before sharply declining during the daytime, indicating the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher velocities, driven by shifting wind directions from the north and east, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or frontal influence. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, more dynamic day, with potential for unsettled weather later in the forecast period.
