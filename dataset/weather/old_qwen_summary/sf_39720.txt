Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the daytime, suggesting the presence of a fog event that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable and slightly elevated throughout the period, indicating consistent high-pressure influence, which typically brings clear and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours, particularly from the northwest, but decreased significantly during midday before increasing again in the late evening, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the northeast and then back to the northwest. These patterns point to a morning fog event driven by marine air intrusion, followed by a clearing trend, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather dynamics.
