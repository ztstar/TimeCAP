Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting the influence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then showed a gradual decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a shift in air mass. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, hinting at a change in large-scale flow. These conditions together suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment toward a drier, slightly more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for localized convection later in the day.
