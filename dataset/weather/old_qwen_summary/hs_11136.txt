Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of low humidity followed by sudden spikes, suggesting intermittent air mass changes or localized convective activity. Air pressure exhibited a mix of declining and rising patterns, with notable drops associated with periods of higher humidity and wind, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained low overall, but increased toward the end of the period, accompanied by consistent wind directions from the southeast, which may indicate an influx of moist air. These conditions collectively suggest the atmosphere was transitioning, with potential for developing thunderstorms, particularly in the late evening and early morning hours.
