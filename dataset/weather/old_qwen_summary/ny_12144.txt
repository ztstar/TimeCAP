Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage and subsequent recovery. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, then sharply decreased during the day, suggesting drying air associated with the passage of a high-pressure system. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, which is typical of a strengthening high-pressure ridge bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours, diminished during midday, and then increased again in the evening, with shifting wind directions indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined trends suggest the remnants of a cold front have passed, leading to improving weather with clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
