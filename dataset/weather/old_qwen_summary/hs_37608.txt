Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of high moisture in the early hours and a sharp decrease in the late afternoon, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with a slight rise during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These conditions point to a transition in the local weather pattern, potentially signaling the approach of a more stable, drier air mass, which may reduce the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
