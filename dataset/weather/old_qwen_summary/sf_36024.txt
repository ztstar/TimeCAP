Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, remaining persistently high, which likely contributed to the formation of low-lying fog and reduced visibility. A marked drop in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, indicating the passage of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary, which also coincided with increased wind activity. Wind speeds and directions showed variability, with stronger gusts and shifting patterns suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods. These combined factors point to a transitional weather phase, likely driven by marine influence and coastal dynamics, resulting in cool, damp conditions with potential for foggy mornings and unstable air later in the day.
