Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning before sharply declining during the midday, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more open air. A significant increase in atmospheric pressure occurred in the early hours of the day, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds remained consistently low except for a brief spike in the late afternoon, accompanied by a dramatic shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, signaling a possible change in air mass. This shift, combined with the pressure rise and drying trend, suggests the onset of a more stable, coastal high-pressure regime typical of San Francisco’s dry summer patterns.
