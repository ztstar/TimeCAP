Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖 (warming) in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, indicating the presence of marine layer conditions typical of the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase in the afternoon, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from southwest to more west-southwest, consistent with coastal flow. These patterns suggest the influence of a persistent marine layer, with potential for foggy conditions in the early morning and improving visibility later in the day.
