Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated through the night before dropping sharply in the late morning, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more dynamic air. Air pressure rose steadily through the early morning, peaked midday, then dropped significantly in the evening, pointing to the passage of a weather system that likely brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early hours and again in the late evening, with wind direction shifting from southwesterly to northeasterly, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow associated with the pressure change. Taken together, these indicators suggest the arrival of a coastal weather shift, potentially bringing clearer skies and cooler temperatures overnight, with implications for fog development and morning visibility.
