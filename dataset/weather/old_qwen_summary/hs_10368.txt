Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or reduced moisture availability. Air pressure steadily declined through the middle of the day before stabilizing, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained minimal throughout, with a brief lull and slight directional shift in the late afternoon, indicating weak synoptic forcing. These conditions suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for instability and possible thunderstorm development later in the day as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
