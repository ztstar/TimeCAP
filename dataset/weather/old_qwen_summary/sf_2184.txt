Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog common in the region during cooler nights. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions to the area. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, followed by a resurgence in wind activity in the afternoon, particularly from the east and southeast, suggesting a shift in local airflow patterns. The combination of low wind, high humidity, and cooling temperatures early in the cycle points to a high likelihood of persistent fog and reduced visibility in coastal and low-lying areas, which could affect travel and outdoor activities.
