Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion or incoming cooler air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before a rapid decline, indicating the passage of a moist air surge followed by drying conditions driven by increased wind. Air pressure exhibited a prominent rise, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization and clearing of conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the final hours of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, which may point to a change in atmospheric flow associated with a developing weather front. These combined patterns suggest that Houston may be transitioning from a humid, stagnant period to a drier, windier regime, potentially setting the stage for improved air quality and clearer skies in the near term.
