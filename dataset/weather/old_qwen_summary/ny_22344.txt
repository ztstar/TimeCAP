Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City remained relatively stable through the night and early morning before showing a notable rise in the late afternoon, indicating a warming trend during daylight hours. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the latter half of the day, suggesting a drying trend as the atmosphere adjusted. Air pressure declined steadily through the afternoon and evening, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly, which is indicative of a passing low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and persisted at elevated levels through the night, with winds shifting from southerly to westerly and eventually southwesterly, consistent with the movement of a weather front. These combined indicators suggest a transition period marked by the influence of a frontal system, potentially leading to variable and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
