Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose dramatically overnight, peaking in the early morning before steadily declining, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to a saturated atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend in the final hours, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind patterns shifted from northeast to south-southeast throughout the day, with increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the development of a more dynamic circulation. These combined factors point to a high probability of thunderstorm activity in the near term, particularly as the atmosphere warms and instability increases.
