Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from a moist marine layer to drier, more stable air. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns and potential onshore flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon suggests improving conditions, with a likely transition toward more stable and sunnier weather in the coming hours.
