Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the afternoon and evening, indicating strong daytime heating. Humidity levels remained relatively high overnight before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition to drier air as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and into the early morning, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest the onset of a more unstable weather regime, potentially leading to afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and lift are sufficient.
