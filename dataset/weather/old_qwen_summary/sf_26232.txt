Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that reflect changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, cool, and stable night period to a potentially clearer and more moderate daytime scenario, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns.
