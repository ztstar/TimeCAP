Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high overnight, dropping significantly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a drying trend likely due to increasing wind and solar heating. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential influence of a weakening low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased steadily from midday onward, with a shift toward more southerly to southeasterly flow, which may facilitate moisture transport and contribute to afternoon convective activity. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a stable, humid night into a potentially unstable, drier day, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the evening.
