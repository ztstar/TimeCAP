Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air, possibly indicating a recent or ongoing precipitation event. Air pressure exhibited a gradual downward trend, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and south, consistent with dynamic atmospheric conditions associated with the low-pressure system. Combined with shifting wind directions and high humidity, these trends suggest a high likelihood of lingering damp conditions or scattered showers in the near term.
