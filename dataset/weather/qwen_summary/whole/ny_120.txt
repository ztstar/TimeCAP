Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before rebounding sharply in the morning, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by warming. Humidity peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting high moisture content likely due to condensation or fog formation, which then dropped as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, signaling an approaching low-pressure system, potentially linked to changing weather conditions. Wind speed intensified significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of dropping pressure, rising wind, and shifting wind direction implies an active weather front moving through the region, which may bring precipitation or stormy conditions in the near future.
