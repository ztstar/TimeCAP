Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night, peaking in the late afternoon, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the southwest, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing winds points to a transition in weather conditions, possibly leading to clearing skies and improved air quality by the next day.
