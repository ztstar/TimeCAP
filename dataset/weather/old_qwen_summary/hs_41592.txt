Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid to upper range, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were moderate to low overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing high-pressure influence. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable winds in the late evening suggests improving conditions and a likely transition to drier, more stable weather in the coming hours.
