Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature decline occurred, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiation and changing air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, peaking before dropping abruptly, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden front followed by drier air. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point around dawn, which is characteristic of an approaching low-pressure system associated with stormy conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the early morning, particularly from a westerly to southwesterly direction, consistent with dynamic air flow tied to the developing low-pressure system. These combined indicators point to a transitional weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and potentially stormy conditions to New York City in the near term.
