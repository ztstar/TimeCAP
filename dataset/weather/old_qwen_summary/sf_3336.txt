Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night and remaining elevated through the early morning, indicating persistent moisture accumulation likely due to coastal fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and potential for unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased during the evening and early night, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with onshore flow typical of marine layer development. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late morning and afternoon, coupled with a return to lower wind speeds, hints at the possible breakdown of the marine layer and a transition toward clearer skies.
