Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests the presence of a boundary layer that suppressed evaporation and allowed for dew formation overnight. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the early hours, followed by a gradual decline, hinting at the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions before weakening. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon as a sea breeze developed, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with coastal influences. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for dry, unstable air to develop later in the day, possibly creating favorable conditions for afternoon thunderstorms.
