Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase overnight, peaking in the early hours, followed by a significant drop in the afternoon, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric stability and the arrival of a weather system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but increased substantially in the late afternoon, with a shift to more southerly and westerly directions, potentially bringing marine air into the region. These combined dynamics point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone coastal condition to a more dynamic, wind-influenced environment, which may lead to changing weather conditions in the coming hours.
