Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, ranging from very dry to near saturation, indicating frequent shifts in air mass and potential for fog or localized precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively high for most of the period, suggesting stable conditions, but a marked drop occurred during the late afternoon, possibly signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, which may reflect the influence of a coastal breeze or frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a dynamic coastal weather pattern, with potential for fog development and changing conditions through the evening.
