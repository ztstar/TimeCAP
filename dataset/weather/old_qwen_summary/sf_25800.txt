Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours and remaining elevated, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions, though a slight drop later in the day may signal a shift. Wind patterns showed strong, variable shifts, with sustained high winds in the early evening followed by a marked decrease overnight, possibly linked to the development of localized coastal effects. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind directions points to a likely foggy and cool environment, especially in low-lying and coastal areas, which could impact visibility and travel conditions.
