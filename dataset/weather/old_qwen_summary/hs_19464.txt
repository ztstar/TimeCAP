Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in Houston steadily increased, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained high, peaking in the mid-to-late afternoon before gradually declining, suggesting a saturated atmosphere that could contribute to discomfort and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, reaching its lowest point in the early morning, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or low-pressure weather patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then easterly, indicating a change in large-scale flow that could enhance moisture transport. These combined factors—rising temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds—point to a developing unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
