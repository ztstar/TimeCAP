Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking above 90% before dropping sharply, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level cloud formation followed by a clearing trend. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation and unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained modest overall but increased slightly in the evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition toward unsettled weather, with potential for precipitation and reduced visibility in the near term.
