Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, likely driven by a developing surface boundary or outflow from convective activity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors reflects changing atmospheric dynamics, potentially signaling the approach of a drier, cooler air mass.
