Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles and possible fog dissipation. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the late night and early morning, consistent with fog formation, before dropping sharply in the afternoon as winds increased and temperatures rose. A notable pressure increase occurred in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from predominantly westerly to southerly and easterly directions, which may reflect changing synoptic patterns or local topographic effects. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and moist environment to a warmer, drier, and more stable regime, potentially signaling the end of a marine layer event.
