Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking above 95%, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature decline. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early evening, followed by a return to stable conditions, suggesting a passing weather system that may have brought the fog and reduced winds. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night, with calm conditions between midnight and dawn, but increased in the late afternoon, likely due to a shift in wind direction and the influence of coastal dynamics. The prevailing wind directions shifted from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting the complex interaction of marine layer movement and local topography.
