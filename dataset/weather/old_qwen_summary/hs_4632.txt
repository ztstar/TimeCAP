Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, reflecting typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, reaching a peak mid-morning before declining slightly, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that may signal the onset of a local circulation or a change in larger-scale airflow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, humid nighttime regime to a drier, more dynamic daytime environment, potentially increasing the risk of elevated fire weather conditions later in the day.
