Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and remaining low into the early morning before gradually rising. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely tied to a marine layer forming over the region. Air pressure showed a steady rise during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that may be stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds remained low initially but increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with coastal onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine influence, with fog and low clouds likely present overnight, potentially affecting visibility and morning commute conditions.
