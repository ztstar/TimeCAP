Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog or mist in the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by fluctuating but generally stable readings, which may signal a passing weather front or low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were weakest during the early morning hours, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with variable wind directions indicating shifting airflow patterns. These combined conditions suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for unstable air and increased chances of afternoon thunderstorms.
