Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking during the coldest part of the night, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds during that period. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a slow recovery, indicating the passage of a weather front, likely associated with a coastal low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the morning hours, particularly from the southeast and east, with stronger gusts coinciding with the pressure drop and rising humidity. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then to more easterly patterns suggests changing synoptic conditions, possibly bringing more moisture and instability to the region.
