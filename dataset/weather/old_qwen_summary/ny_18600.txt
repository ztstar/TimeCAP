Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and continued into the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moist air, which likely contributed to a noticeable drop in temperature overnight. Air pressure experienced a significant spike midday before declining sharply, signaling a passing weather front that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest to west, consistent with the development of a low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to easterly suggests dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially leading to unsettled weather in the near term.
