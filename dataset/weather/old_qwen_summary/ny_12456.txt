Temperatures showed a steady rise over the past 24 hours, indicating a warming trend that may signal the approach of a milder air mass. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air infiltration, which could suppress cloud formation and precipitation. Air pressure remained consistently low, with minor fluctuations, pointing to a persistent low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from variable directions, potentially enhancing mixing and dispersion of air pollutants. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east may indicate the arrival of a new air flow, possibly bringing changes in weather conditions such as increased cloud cover or a potential shift in temperature trends.
