Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which is consistent with fog formation and the presence of a strong marine layer. Air pressure showed a slow but steady increase, suggesting the gradual approach of a high-pressure system that may stabilize conditions and reduce further fog development. Wind speeds remained low to moderate with frequent directional shifts, particularly from the northeast to east sectors, which is characteristic of offshore flow and coastal convergence. These combined factors point to a transition from dense fog and cool conditions toward clearer skies and milder temperatures, likely improving visibility and comfort in the coming hours.
