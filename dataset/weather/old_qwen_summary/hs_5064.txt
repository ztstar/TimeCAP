Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the day, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, reaching a low before gradually recovering, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that point to the influence of a developing surface boundary or outflow from earlier convection. These combined factors signal a high likelihood of scattered thunderstorms developing later in the evening or overnight, particularly as warm, moist air continues to converge near the surface.
