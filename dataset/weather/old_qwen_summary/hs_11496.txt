Temperature showed a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nighttime cooling trend with a morning warming phase. Humidity experienced significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture levels interrupted by sharp drops, suggesting intermittent air mass changes or localized precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts of stronger winds late at night and early morning, coinciding with shifts in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly, hinting at a changing synoptic pattern. These combined indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially leading to unstable conditions and the possibility of thunderstorms later in the day.
