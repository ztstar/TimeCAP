Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and continued through the afternoon, suggesting a transition from colder to milder conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of high moisture in the early hours followed by a sharp drop during midday, which likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced fog formation. Air pressure steadily rose, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings fair weather and improved visibility. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and south, potentially enhancing dispersion of pollutants and contributing to a cooling effect despite the warming temperatures. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and southerly suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing drier and more stable conditions, which may result in clear, crisp weather in the coming hours.
