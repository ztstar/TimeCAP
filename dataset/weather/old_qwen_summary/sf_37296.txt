Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime highs. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during those periods. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system that brought in moist, unstable air. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight hours, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and south, which helped mix the boundary layer and disperse fog as the day progressed. By late afternoon, winds eased and shifted to more southerly and westerly directions, coinciding with clearing skies and a return to more stable atmospheric conditions.
