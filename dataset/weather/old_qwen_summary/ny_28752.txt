Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, suggesting a cold front passage. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, reflecting drier air associated with the approaching front, followed by a modest increase later in the day. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a high-pressure system dominating the region and bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased during the early hours, with stronger gusts from the southwest, then moderated, though sustained winds remained significant, contributing to a noticeable wind chill. The consistent wind direction from the west to southwest throughout most of the day suggests a well-defined flow aligned with the advancing high-pressure system, likely suppressing cloud formation and maintaining dry, crisp air.
