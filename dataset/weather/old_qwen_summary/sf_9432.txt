Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with values consistently near or at 100%, indicating persistent fog or low-level cloud cover. Temperature trends showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a diurnal cycle with a cooling night and warming daytime. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low, but wind direction shifted significantly—from a prevailing southwest to a more northerly and variable pattern in the afternoon, potentially indicating a change in airflow due to local topography or atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy night into a potentially clearer, more stable afternoon, though lingering moisture may delay full clearing.
