Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a steady rise in temperature, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming daytime pattern. Humidity levels climbed sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation before declining, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, signaling the approach or passage of a low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast, aligning with typical synoptic patterns during frontal passages. The combination of rising temperatures, lingering high humidity, and weakening pressure suggests a high likelihood of continued instability, potentially leading to thunderstorm development later in the day.
