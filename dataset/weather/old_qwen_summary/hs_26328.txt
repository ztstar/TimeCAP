Temperature rose steadily throughout the day, indicating a warming trend from early morning into late afternoon, followed by a slight cooling in the evening. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or the passage of a front. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a dramatic drop that coincided with rising wind speeds and changing wind direction, hinting at a developing weather system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon, with gusts from the southeast, consistent with a developing low-pressure influence. These combined factors point to an approaching storm system, potentially bringing thunderstorms and unstable conditions to Houston in the near term.
