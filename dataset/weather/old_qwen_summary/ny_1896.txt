Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually warming slightly. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, particularly in the early hours, indicating clear, dry air, which likely contributed to rapid nighttime cooling. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the mid-to-late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, suggesting the influence of a strong, cold front that has since passed. The combination of dropping temperatures, decreasing humidity, rising pressure, and diminishing winds suggests that the city is now under the influence of a stable, dry, and cooler air mass, likely resulting in clear skies and pleasant conditions into the next day.
