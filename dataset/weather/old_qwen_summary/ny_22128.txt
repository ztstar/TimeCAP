Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon and evening, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and low wind speeds. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting increasing moisture content in the air, possibly due to reduced mixing and radiative cooling. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during nighttime hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast by late evening, indicating a change in atmospheric flow that could influence upcoming air mass movements. These combined trends point to a transition toward more stable, dry, and potentially chilly conditions in the coming hours, with little likelihood of precipitation.
