Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回暖 in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming trend. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting possible clearing skies or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly and northwesterly to southeasterly and later easterly, consistent with the influence of a developing weather front. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a dynamic weather change, likely leading to increased cloud cover, potential precipitation, and cooler conditions later in the day.
