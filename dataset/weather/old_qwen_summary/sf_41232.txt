Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the late night and early morning, driven by shifting wind direction from the southwest to the west, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a gradual decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. The return of lower humidity and increasing winds in the late evening may signal the dissipation of fog and a shift toward clearer skies, though residual coolness and variable winds are expected.
