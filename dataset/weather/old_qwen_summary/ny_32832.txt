Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure was observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a cooling pattern overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and wind shifts. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near 93%, which supports the likelihood of fog or drizzle formation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, consistent with storm-related inflow. Combined with shifting wind directions and pressure drops, these patterns suggest a developing weather system that may bring precipitation and potentially stronger winds later in the day.
