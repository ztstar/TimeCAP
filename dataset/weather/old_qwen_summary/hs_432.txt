Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking overnight before dropping dramatically during the day, indicating a transition from moist, stable air to dry, warmer conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, reaching a peak mid-morning before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with near-calm conditions at times, but increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a stable, humid nocturnal environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorm development.
