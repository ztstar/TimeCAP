Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated throughout the early morning before showing some fluctuation, indicating possible fog development and dissipation. Air pressure increased steadily during the night and early morning, stabilizing at a higher level, which suggests the influence of a high-pressure system bringing relatively stable conditions. Wind speeds were weakest during the early morning hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from cool, fog-prone conditions to a drier, more stable atmosphere in the late afternoon, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility.
