Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, peaking during the overnight hours and dipping in the late morning, indicating possible moisture influx followed by drying trends. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest a complex interaction of local and regional airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the potential for clearer skies and drier air in the coming hours, though residual moisture could still support isolated afternoon showers.
