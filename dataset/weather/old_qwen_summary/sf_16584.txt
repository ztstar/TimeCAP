Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation and remaining near 100% for much of the night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight overall decline, suggesting a weak low-pressure influence that may have contributed to the damp conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief increases toward the end of the period, and wind direction shifted from southwest to more west-southwest, consistent with marine air intrusion. These combined conditions point to a persistent marine layer, likely resulting in foggy, cool, and damp weather—typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
