Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a possible nocturnal temperature drop likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking shortly before dawn, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase during the midday hours, while wind direction showed frequent shifts, including a strong southerly component in the early morning, possibly linked to a local thermal breeze or a minor synoptic influence. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but potentially enhancing nighttime cooling.
