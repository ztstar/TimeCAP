Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning and remained extremely high for extended periods, indicating persistent moisture and the potential for fog or drizzle. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the elevated humidity and reduced wind speeds. Wind patterns showed a shift from consistent southeasterly flow to calmer conditions with variable, often light, winds, culminating in a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction toward the west and southwest later in the day. These combined factors suggest an unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of localized thunderstorms or heavy showers, particularly as temperatures begin to rise again.
