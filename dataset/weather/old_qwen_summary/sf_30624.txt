Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking during the night, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp increase in the late evening followed by a sustained decline, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind patterns shifted from easterly to southerly and then westerly directions, with sustained gusts during the late night and early morning, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined factors point to a transition period influenced by an approaching low-pressure system, potentially leading to overcast conditions and a chance of light coastal precipitation in the coming hours.
