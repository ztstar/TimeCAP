Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable increase midday, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and morning, increasing during the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, hinting at a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a drier, more stable environment, though lingering moisture may still pose a risk for isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
