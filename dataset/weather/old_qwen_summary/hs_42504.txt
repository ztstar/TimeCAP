Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles typical of the region. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity, but a slight rise in the late afternoon may hint at the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted notably from easterly to southerly and later to more westerly and northwesterly directions, with intermittent gusts, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period with lingering moisture and weak synoptic forcing, increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms later in the day.
