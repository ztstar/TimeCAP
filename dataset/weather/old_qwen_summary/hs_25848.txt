Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a stable nighttime pattern to a more dynamic daytime regime. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the pre-dawn hours. A distinct shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast and then back to the east-southeast suggests a change in air mass, possibly associated with a passing front or a shift in regional pressure systems. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, reaching strong levels, which may have contributed to mixing of the boundary layer and the dispersal of moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight rise during the mid-afternoon could indicate the influence of a high-pressure system approaching, potentially leading to clearer skies and drier conditions in the coming hours.
