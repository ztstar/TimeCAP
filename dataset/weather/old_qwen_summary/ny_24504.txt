Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual rise in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of early autumn. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, with gusts reaching higher levels, potentially contributing to the dispersion of moisture and the clearing of skies. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northerly in the late afternoon hints at a changing air mass, possibly bringing cooler, drier air and improving overall weather conditions.
