Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a transition from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure remained elevated throughout the period, suggesting stable high-pressure influence, which typically suppresses storm development but can trap moisture near the surface. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and later to more westerly and northerly, signaling a change in air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns implies a high potential for persistent low clouds or fog in the morning, with gradual improvement in conditions as the day progresses.
