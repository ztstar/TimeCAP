Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating the influence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloudiness and moisture. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, particularly between midnight and noon, with calm conditions likely enhancing fog formation, while a shift in wind direction later in the day hints at a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions collectively suggest the presence of a marine layer that has recently dissipated, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
