Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, coinciding with increased wind speeds and shifting wind directions from the southwest to southeast, suggesting the passage of a weather front. The persistent wind from the south-southwest in the late afternoon may have brought in moist maritime air, reinforcing the high humidity and potentially supporting continued cloud cover. Overall, the data indicates a transition from a cool, foggy, and damp period to a drier and slightly warmer afternoon, consistent with typical coastal weather patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics.
