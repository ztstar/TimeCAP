Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day and into the evening, indicating a shift toward more stable daytime heating conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours and declining through the afternoon, suggesting a mix of nocturnal moisture accumulation and daytime drying. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend in the latter half of the period, particularly during the late evening and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate to brisk, with a steady southerly to easterly flow that gradually shifted toward the southeast, potentially transporting moist air into the region. These combined patterns point to an increasing likelihood of unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
