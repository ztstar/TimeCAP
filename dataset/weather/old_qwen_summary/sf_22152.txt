Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a gradual rebound in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the overnight hours, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating high potential for fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, calm conditions and the persistence of low-level cloud cover. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, then increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with dense fog and cool, damp air likely affecting visibility and surface temperatures, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
