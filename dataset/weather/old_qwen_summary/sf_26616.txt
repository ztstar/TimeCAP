Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion typical of coastal fog events. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low to moderate overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast during the morning hours, likely associated with a change in local circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier air later in the day, which may enhance visibility and comfort.
