Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning hours, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply as the day progressed, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more dynamic air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, particularly from the northwest and west directions, likely driven by an advancing cold front or upper-level disturbance. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and strong northerly winds signals a shift toward drier and cooler conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms and improving air quality in the region.
