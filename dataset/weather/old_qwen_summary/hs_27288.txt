Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low but increased in the afternoon and early evening, consistent with daytime thermal convection and the influence of a strengthening surface-level pressure gradient. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and steady wind direction points to improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air by the next day.
