Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early hours and remaining elevated, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, which may have contributed to a more oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a notable increase starting in the early afternoon, reaching a peak before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified through the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and westerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for clearing skies. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable environment to a drier, more stable regime, likely leading to clearer conditions in the coming hours.
