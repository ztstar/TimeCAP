Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly in the early morning hours, indicating a transition toward cooler conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near dawn, which suggests moisture-laden air and the potential for dew formation or fog. A gradual drop in air pressure during the middle of the period, followed by a slight recovery, points to the passage of a low-pressure system, possibly associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then southeasterly, indicating changing airflow patterns typical of storm development. These combined factors suggest the possibility of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially given the convergence of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind dynamics.
