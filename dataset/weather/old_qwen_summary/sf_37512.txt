Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with periods of high moisture coinciding with lower temperatures and a sharp decline in humidity during midday, indicating drier air advection. Air pressure exhibited a significant drop in the early hours, followed by a rebound, signaling the influence of a low-pressure system that brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly, consistent with coastal upwelling and marine layer dynamics. The combination of cooling, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to an active marine layer regime, which likely contributed to fog formation and a cooler, more variable climate near the coast.
