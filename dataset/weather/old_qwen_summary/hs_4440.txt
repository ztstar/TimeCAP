Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more northerly, consistent with the tightening of the high-pressure ridge. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, which has likely brought drier air and improved conditions, though residual moisture may still support the possibility of isolated afternoon showers.
