Over the past 24 hours, a notable drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler night into a milder day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and again in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture accumulation linked to overnight condensation and a recent weather system. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, potentially indicating the influence of a developing or passing frontal system. Combined with shifts in wind direction and rising humidity, these patterns suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment that could lead to precipitation or stormy conditions later in the day.
