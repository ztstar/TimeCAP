Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the midday, suggesting a transition from foggy or misty conditions to clearer skies. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then easterly, indicating the approach of a weather front. The wind pattern suggests the influence of a coastal low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the observed pressure fall and increasing wind activity. These conditions point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing a change in weather patterns such as increased cloud cover or precipitation in the coming hours.
