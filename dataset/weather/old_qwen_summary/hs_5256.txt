Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating a transition from a more stable, moist air mass to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting the absence of strong frontal systems, though a slight increase during midday may hint at improving weather stability. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions around dawn, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, driven by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in air flow. These conditions suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with potential for localized convection later in the evening.
