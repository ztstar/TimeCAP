Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by reduced cloud cover and increased solar insolation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase overnight followed by a dramatic drop in the midday hours, suggesting the passage of a front or a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase, especially in the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief intensification in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of a coastal pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition from a cooler, moist maritime environment to a warmer, drier, and more stable regime, likely leading to improved visibility and favorable conditions for outdoor activities in the coming hours.
