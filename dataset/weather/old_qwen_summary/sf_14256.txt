Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual temperature recovery in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, dropping sharply during mid-morning before surging to near saturation in the early hours, indicating a significant shift in air mass or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a small dip coincided with the period of lowest temperatures. Wind activity was highly intermittent, with strong gusts in the late evening and overnight, particularly from the southwest and west, likely contributing to the mixing of air and influence on fog development. These conditions collectively point to a classic coastal marine layer pattern, with nighttime cooling, fog formation, and onshore winds playing a dominant role in shaping the region’s weather.
