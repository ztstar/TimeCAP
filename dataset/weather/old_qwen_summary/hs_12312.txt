Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant temperature rise during daylight hours. Humidity levels declined sharply during the day, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting drier air circulation and reduced moisture availability. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend after peaking in the early morning, which may signal the approach of a developing low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, potentially indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest the possibility of unsettled weather conditions in the near term, including potential for thunderstorms or precipitation as the system evolves.
