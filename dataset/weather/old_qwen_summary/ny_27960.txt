Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning to decrease, indicating a period of moist air accumulation likely associated with a low-pressure influence. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early morning, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought cooler and more humid conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to the arrival of a cold front that has brought cooler, damper air and increasing wind, potentially leading to unsettled conditions in the near term.
