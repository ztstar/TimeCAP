Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which indicates high moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late afternoon and evening, with wind speeds increasing and direction changing from southerly to more westerly and northerly, possibly signaling the approach of a cold front. Air pressure showed a slight rise during midday, followed by a dip in the late evening, which may reflect the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing instability and the potential for changing conditions, including possible showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
