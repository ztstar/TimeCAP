Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late morning, suggesting the arrival of a moist air mass that may contribute to potential fog or overcast conditions. Air pressure rose sharply during the early morning, reaching a peak before declining later in the day, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were initially moderate and variable, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to unsettled or more variable weather in the coming hours.
