Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the midday, suggesting a transition from a moist marine layer to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to increased cloud cover and reduced visibility. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a persistent offshore component in the morning and a shift to onshore flow in the late afternoon, potentially bringing in moist air from the Pacific. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with strong influences from marine air masses and diurnal temperature cycles.
