Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the daytime, suggesting a transition from nocturnal moisture accumulation to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition toward more stable and dry conditions, with potential implications for reduced precipitation risk and improved air quality in the coming hours.
