Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, plummeting during the day after a period of near-saturated conditions overnight, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass following a period of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure rose steadily during the morning and peaked in the late afternoon, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight hours, particularly in the pre-dawn period, before subsiding to light breezes, with winds shifting from coastal to more inland directions, consistent with a sea breeze reversal. These observations point to a transition from a foggy, moist maritime environment to a drier, more stable regime, which may persist into the coming hours with clear skies and mild temperatures.
