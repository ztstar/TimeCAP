Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and a potential shift toward more stable daytime conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moisture accumulation and a heightened likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during the night. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, accompanied by sustained high wind speeds, particularly from the south and southeast, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable air and an increased risk of thunderstorms. Wind direction shifted consistently toward the south and southeast, aligning with a moist maritime inflow from the Gulf of Mexico, which contributes to the region’s high humidity and convective potential. Together, these indicators point to an active atmospheric environment with potential for isolated thunderstorms, especially during the afternoon hours when temperatures and instability are highest.
