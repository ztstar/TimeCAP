Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a milder phase. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or light precipitation during the early hours. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and into the morning points to an approaching low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate but consistent, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors indicate that the city is transitioning into a period of potentially cloudy, damp weather with a risk of light rain or drizzle later in the day.
