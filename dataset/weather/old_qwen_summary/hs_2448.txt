Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a steady warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, dropping noticeably during midday before rising again in the evening, suggesting the influence of nocturnal dew point increases and daytime convective mixing. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southwest, potentially contributing to the development of localized showers or thunderstorms. The shift in wind direction from southeast to west-southwest in the late afternoon, combined with rising humidity and warming temperatures, indicates the potential for convective activity later in the evening or overnight.
