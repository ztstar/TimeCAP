Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the overnight period, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to increased fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight rise suggests possible high-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to more southerly directions, with speeds increasing in the late evening, potentially bringing in moisture-laden air. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward a more humid and potentially unstable atmosphere, raising the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
