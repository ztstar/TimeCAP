Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating the presence of moist air mass that may contribute to increased cloud cover or potential for precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south, which could signal the approach of a weather front or increased convective activity. Combined with rising humidity and fluctuating wind directions, these patterns suggest a transitional weather phase that may lead to scattered thunderstorms or elevated instability later in the day.
