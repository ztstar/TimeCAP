Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning and remaining elevated, suggesting a possible increase in moisture availability. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong southerly to westerly flows, followed by a notable shift to more northerly and easterly directions in the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions with a cooling influence, likely resulting in clear skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
