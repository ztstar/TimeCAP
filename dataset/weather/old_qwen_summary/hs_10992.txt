Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with periods of high moisture overnight and in the evening, followed by a sharp drop during midday, suggesting possible clearing or drying air mass influence. Air pressure exhibited a consistent rise through the early morning hours, peaking midday before declining steadily into the evening, signaling a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief increases during the early morning and late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, indicating changing airflow patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a stable, moist environment to a drier, more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity later in the day.
