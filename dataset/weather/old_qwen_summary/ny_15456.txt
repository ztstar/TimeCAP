Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant temperature drop during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and cooling radiative losses. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation before plummeting during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a frontal system that brought moisture and then cleared the skies. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rising sharply in the midday, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that brought drier, cooler air. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the night and early morning, then increased again in the afternoon, with wind directions shifting from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These trends collectively point to a transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable regime, likely resulting in improving conditions with clearer skies and cooler temperatures by late day.
