Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure fluctuated markedly, with a pronounced drop in the early hours followed by a recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought increased cloud cover and precipitation risk. Wind speeds were generally light early on, with a brief intensification in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air flow patterns consistent with an approaching frontal boundary. These dynamics point to a complex weather scenario with potential for thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly given the combination of warming temperatures, residual moisture, and shifting wind patterns.
