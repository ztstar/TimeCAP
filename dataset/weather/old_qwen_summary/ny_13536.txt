Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping precipitously, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden front and subsequent drying of the air. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, implying the influence of a low-pressure system that has now begun to weaken. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the northwest and shifting toward the northeast, consistent with a developing or transitioning weather pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind direction points to a transition from cooler, damp conditions to drier, more variable winds, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather regime.
