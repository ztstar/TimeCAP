Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of overnight radiation loss and increasing solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation, which suggests fog formation and low visibility conditions typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure rose significantly in the early morning, peaking before declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, reflecting changing synoptic patterns and possible sea-breeze development. These combined factors point to the typical coastal weather cycle, with fog and cool temperatures in the morning giving way to clearer skies and milder conditions in the afternoon.
