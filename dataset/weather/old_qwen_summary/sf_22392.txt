Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of dense fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity, though a slight drop toward the end of the period may hint at evolving atmospheric conditions. Winds were light and variable during the night and early morning, shifting to a more consistent southerly to southwesterly flow by late evening, which could signal the onset of a marine layer influence. The combination of high moisture, stable pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests the continued presence of coastal fog, which may affect visibility and contribute to a damp, cool sensation in the city.
