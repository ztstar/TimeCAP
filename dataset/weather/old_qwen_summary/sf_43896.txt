Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable until late evening, when a slight decline occurred, suggesting the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, except during early morning and late afternoon periods, with shifts in wind direction pointing to changing air mass influences, including a shift from southerly to northerly flows. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable winds supports conditions favorable for persistent fog, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which is consistent with San Francisco’s typical microclimate patterns.
