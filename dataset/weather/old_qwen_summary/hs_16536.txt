Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure trend, which may signal the approach of a weather system capable of bringing precipitation. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a noticeable reduction in the early hours before increasing again in the late afternoon, suggesting changing atmospheric stability. The wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and eventually to a northerly component in the final hours, aligning with a potential cold front or upper-level disturbance influencing the region.
