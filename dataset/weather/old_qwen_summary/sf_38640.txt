Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a notable spike during the early morning and again in the late evening, suggesting potential fog formation or marine layer activity. Air pressure fluctuated, with a sustained rise after midnight, indicating improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction suggesting dynamic airflow changes, including onshore and offshore influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, damp marine layer to a clearer, more stable atmosphere, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather patterns.
