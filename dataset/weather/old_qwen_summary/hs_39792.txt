Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation overnight, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which then began to decline as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight decline through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-morning before a gradual drop, suggesting a weak low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to southeasterly in the early hours and a transition to more variable patterns later, indicating changing flow dynamics. These conditions point to a transition period likely associated with a passing frontal boundary, potentially setting the stage for increased instability and precipitation later in the day.
