Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually warming again, indicating a nighttime temperature inversion. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which increases the likelihood of fog and uncomfortable conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable weather in the coming hours. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, dropping to near calm levels before increasing again in the late morning, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward more stable, potentially dry conditions, though lingering high humidity may delay any significant relief from the muggy atmosphere.
