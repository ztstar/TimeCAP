Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, particularly in the late night and early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase toward the end of the period, driven by shifting wind directions from southwest to south and eventually east, consistent with frontal passage. These combined trends point to an active weather system moving through the region, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
