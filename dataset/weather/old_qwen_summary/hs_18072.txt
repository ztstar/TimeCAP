Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual increase during the morning and early afternoon, followed by a slight decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening front or localized weather change. Wind speeds were generally low, with calm conditions in the early hours and a shift in wind direction across all quadrants, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns possibly due to a shifting pressure gradient. The combination of rising overnight humidity, a drop in winds, and variable wind direction points to a potentially unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms as temperatures rise and moisture persists into the evening.
