Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable increase toward the end of the period, suggesting the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable one. These combined trends point to a post-frontal environment, with improving conditions and a likely decrease in precipitation risk in the near term.
