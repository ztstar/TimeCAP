Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation in the early hours, indicating strong moisture buildup, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A significant pressure spike occurred mid-afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought drier air and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from southerly flows in the early morning to a more westerly and then northerly direction, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
