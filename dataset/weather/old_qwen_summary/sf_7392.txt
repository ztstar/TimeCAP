Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog and increased mixing with drier air. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating but generally stable patterns, with a notable spike in the early morning hours, possibly signaling the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in wind flow. Wind speeds increased slightly during the night and again in the late afternoon, with consistent southerly to westerly flow, contributing to the movement of moist maritime air inland. These dynamics point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, warmer afternoons, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and may influence outdoor activities and air quality in the region.
