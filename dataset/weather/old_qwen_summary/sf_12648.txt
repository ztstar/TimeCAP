Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, dropping sharply in the late night and early morning before rebounding significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass followed by increased moisture, possibly linked to marine layer development. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline during the early morning, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon, which may signal the influence of a passing weather front, potentially associated with a low-pressure system moving inland. Wind patterns were initially moderate and variable, with a period of calm in the early morning, followed by stronger, more consistent winds in the late afternoon, likely driven by a pressure gradient from the coast to inland areas. These combined factors point to dynamic atmospheric changes, including the arrival of a coastal upwelling event and a shift from dry, stable conditions to more humid and potentially unstable air, increasing the likelihood of fog or light drizzle later in the day.
