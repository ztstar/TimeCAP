Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, hinting at the possible influence of a weak high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light in the early hours but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to east-northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest an approaching weather transition, possibly leading to more unstable conditions later in the day.
