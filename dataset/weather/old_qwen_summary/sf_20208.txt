Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a slow recovery. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooler conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable weather in the coming hours. Wind speeds remained light for most of the period but doubled in the latter half, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the onset of coastal upwelling. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer pattern, common in San Francisco’s climate, where cool, moist air is trapped near the surface, leading to foggy mornings and mild temperatures throughout the day.
