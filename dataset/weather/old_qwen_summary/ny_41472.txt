Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a trough in the early morning before gradually rising during the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more variable conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought more stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, driven by shifts in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to more northerly sectors. These patterns point to a developing ridge of high pressure, likely resulting in improving conditions with reduced cloud cover and lower chances of precipitation in the near term.
