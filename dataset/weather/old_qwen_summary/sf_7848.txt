Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a persistent marine influence and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a sharp rise early in the period suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with periodic bursts that coincided with shifts in wind direction, especially from the northwest to the southwest, reflecting changing synoptic patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cooler, moist maritime air mass to a slightly drier, warming regime, possibly signaling the onset of a more stable and pleasant period.
