Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming cycle through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, indicating potential for fog or dew formation, with a significant drop in moisture content during the late afternoon. Air pressure showed sustained variability, with a gradual decline that suggests the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the overnight period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors point to an approaching weather change, likely bringing unstable conditions and a potential for precipitation later in the day.
