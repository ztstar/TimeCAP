Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed marked variability, peaking during the early hours and again in the late afternoon, suggesting possible moisture influx or localized convective activity. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, reaching a high in the early morning, which typically indicates improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with a brief but strong gust from the northwest, likely associated with a passing frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a changing airflow pattern, potentially signaling the influence of a cold front that has brought drier, cooler air into the region.
