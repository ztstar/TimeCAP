Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning and late night hours, reaching saturation at times, which suggests a strong likelihood of fog or mist formation during those periods. Air pressure showed a slight increase during midday, followed by a modest decline in the evening, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric stability and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind patterns evolved from southerly to variable directions, with a marked increase in speed and a shift toward easterly and northeasterly flows in the late afternoon, potentially indicating the approach of a frontal boundary. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition period with lingering moisture and variable winds, raising the possibility of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
