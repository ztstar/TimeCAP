Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling phase likely due to clear skies and low wind speeds. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, suggesting fog formation or high moisture content, which then declined sharply as the sun rose and winds increased, leading to a drying trend. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the night, stabilizing at high levels before a sudden decrease in the afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in atmospheric conditions associated with a passing weather system. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning but intensified in the mid-to-late afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, hinting at the arrival of offshore winds or a change in synoptic flow. These combined factors—cooling, drying, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind patterns—suggest the city transitioned from a stable, fog-prone environment to a more dynamic and potentially variable weather regime, consistent with typical coastal transitions in the region.
