Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual回暖 (warming) in the early morning and midday, suggesting a cooling trend that reversed as the day progressed. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating a period of moisture accumulation, which then dropped sharply during the afternoon, signaling the dissipation of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise overnight, stabilizing at higher levels during the day, which typically correlates with improving weather and clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, particularly from the northeast, before subsiding, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and then southeast by late evening, indicating a change in air mass. These patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, resulting in a transition from damp, cooler conditions to drier, milder air, likely bringing clearer skies and more comfortable conditions for the remainder of the day.
