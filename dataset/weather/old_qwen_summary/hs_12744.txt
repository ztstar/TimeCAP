Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated through early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight decline in the late afternoon, consistent with a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the early morning hours, decreasing in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from predominantly northwest to more variable, including southwesterly to easterly components later in the day. These patterns suggest the passage of a weak front or mesoscale disturbance, potentially setting the stage for increased cloudiness and a higher chance of isolated afternoon showers.
