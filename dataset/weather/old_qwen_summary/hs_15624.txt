Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, remaining near saturation, which suggests conditions favorable for fog or dew formation, particularly during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early hours, followed by a slight decline late in the day, signaling the possible passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the west and northwest, hinting at a shift in atmospheric circulation that may bring changing weather conditions. The wind direction transitioned from southeasterly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow, potentially indicating the approach of a drier, cooler air mass that could reduce humidity and clear skies in the coming hours.
