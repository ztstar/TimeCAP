Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler, stable period to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds typical of coastal conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the early hours, reaching a peak before sharply declining, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the late night and early morning, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, consistent with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a coastal fog event to clearer, drier conditions later in the day, potentially influencing visibility and outdoor activities.
