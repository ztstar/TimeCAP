Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift from stable to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a slight drop in the final hours, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable surge in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions consistent with coastal influences and shifting pressure gradients. These trends point to a transition from cool, moist conditions overnight to warmer, drier conditions later in the day, likely due to a weakening marine layer and increased onshore flow.
