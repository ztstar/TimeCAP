Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a distinct overnight cooling trend followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the season. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late afternoon, which is often associated with approaching weather systems and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southwest, consistent with a developing low-pressure system drawing in moisture and energy. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these trends point to a high likelihood of unsettled weather, including possible showers or thunderstorms, later in the day.
