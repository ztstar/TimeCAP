Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase likely due to stable air mass conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and later from the south, indicating a shift in wind patterns possibly linked to a developing pressure gradient. The change in wind direction from westerly to southerly late in the cycle may suggest the onset of a frontal influence, potentially bringing moisture and instability in the coming hours.
