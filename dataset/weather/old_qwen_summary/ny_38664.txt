Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased, indicating a warming trend that suggests the approach of a more stable and milder air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of high moisture in the early morning and late evening, followed by drier conditions during midday, pointing to intermittent air mass changes. Air pressure exhibited a consistent decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the influence of an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then westerly, consistent with cyclogenesis and storm development. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially unstable and inclement weather, including possible precipitation and stronger winds.
