Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist. Air pressure fluctuated with a pronounced rise during the early morning, indicating the influence of a passing high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly mid-day, especially in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, potentially signaling the approach of a front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds suggests a transition toward fairer weather, though residual moisture may still support isolated showers later in the day.
