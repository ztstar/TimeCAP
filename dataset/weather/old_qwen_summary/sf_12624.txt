Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining sharply overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours, then increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of moist air, likely driven by marine influence. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the final hours, accompanied by rising wind speeds and a shift toward more southerly wind directions, signaling the approach of a frontal system or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds intensified through the night, reaching peak values in the early morning, which may contribute to increased fog formation and coastal mixing. These combined trends point to a transition in weather conditions, with potential for fog, cooler temperatures, and unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
