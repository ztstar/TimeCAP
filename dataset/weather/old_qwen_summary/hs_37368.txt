Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, which may be linked to a nocturnal radiative cooling effect or the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of high moisture followed by drier conditions, suggesting intermittent air mass changes that could influence cloud formation and precipitation potential. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings more stable and clear weather. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with strong gusts during mid-to-late night and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions, especially from the northeast and east, consistent with a developing synoptic-scale pattern. These combined trends suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, though lingering moisture and wind shifts could still support isolated shower development later in the day.
