Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise as the day progressed, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the overnight period and remained elevated through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night and early morning, coinciding with increased wind speeds and shifts in wind direction, which points to the influence of a passing weather system—possibly a cold front or low-pressure trough. Wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly and then toward the west and southwest, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation that likely facilitated the movement of moisture and air mass transitions. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic weather shift, with the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, including possible convective activity as warming and moisture reaccumulate.
