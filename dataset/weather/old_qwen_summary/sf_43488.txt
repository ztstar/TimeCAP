Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly during the afternoon, a pattern consistent with the formation and dissipation of fog and low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system maintaining stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, which may have contributed to the mixing of air layers and the eventual clearing of the marine layer. These factors together suggest a transition from a foggy, damp morning to a clearer, breezier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s coastal microclimate.
