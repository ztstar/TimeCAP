Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels peaked and remained near saturation through the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation and persistence, which is typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, consistent with offshore flow that may disperse fog. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and declining humidity suggests improving visibility and a transition toward drier, more stable weather conditions.
