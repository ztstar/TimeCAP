Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained consistently high and stable, indicating the presence of a strong high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development and contributed to clear skies. Wind speeds were minimal throughout most of the night and early morning, with a gradual increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with coastal fog and cool, moist air dominating the overnight hours and clearing somewhat during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
