Over the past 24 hours, temperature gradually increased, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, especially in the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained consistently high, with a notable spike in the final hours, suggesting moist air accumulation that may contribute to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the middle of the period followed by a sharp rise toward the end, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northeast toward the southeast, which may indicate changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the potential for unsettled weather, including possible precipitation or reduced visibility, particularly in the early hours of the next day.
