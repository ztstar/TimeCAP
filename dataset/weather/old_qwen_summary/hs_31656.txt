Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which persisted through much of the night. Air pressure remained consistently high, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions, though a slight decline in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a weather shift. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, particularly from the southwest, with stronger gusts possibly indicating the onset of a changing air mass or a developing disturbance. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly and then to westerly suggests a dynamic reorganization of surface winds, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns.
