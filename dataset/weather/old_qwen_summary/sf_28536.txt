Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A significant drop in air pressure during the early morning was followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with coastal fog and wind shifts. Wind speeds increased notably in the early hours, with strong northerly and westerly components, consistent with onshore flow typical of the region's marine layer. The combination of high humidity, lingering fog, and fluctuating wind patterns points to a persistent marine influence, likely resulting in cool, damp conditions through the night and into the next day.
