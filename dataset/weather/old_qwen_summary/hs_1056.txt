Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, which suggests a shift from stable, moist conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure fluctuated with a notable drop in the late afternoon, followed by a resurgence, signaling possible atmospheric instability that could precede convective activity. Wind speeds were variable, with brief bursts of stronger winds during the night and early morning, while wind direction shifted widely, reflecting changing air mass influences. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather environment with potential for localized thunderstorms later in the day.
