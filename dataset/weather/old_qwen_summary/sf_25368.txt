Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual warming phase in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and late evening, suggesting persistent moisture, likely due to marine influence, with a sharp drop during midday indicating clearing conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-afternoon before declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late evening, with strong westerly and southwesterly winds indicating a shift in synoptic flow, possibly linked to the movement of a coastal front. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a dynamic transition from a stable marine layer to a more variable air mass, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions later in the day.
