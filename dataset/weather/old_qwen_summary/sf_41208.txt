Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before stabilizing in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a weather front that may have brought the cooler, moister air. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly and northerly directions during the night to more southerly and easterly flows in the late morning, suggesting changes in regional pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind directions points to the influence of marine layer dynamics, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with potential for persistent fog and cool conditions into the next day.
