Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, followed by a slight decline, pointing to a passing high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, indicating a change in air mass movement. These combined factors suggest that a frontal passage may have occurred, bringing cooler, drier air and setting the stage for more stable conditions later in the day.
