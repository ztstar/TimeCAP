Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent but unchanging high-pressure system that has likely contributed to the stable, dry conditions in the late afternoon. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm and brief increases, while wind direction shifted dramatically in the morning, transitioning from southwest to northeast, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. These patterns collectively point to a coastal fog event during the night and early morning, followed by clearing skies and warming conditions as the day progressed.
