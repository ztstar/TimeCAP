Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend through the night, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from maritime influence to stronger daytime heating. Humidity levels dropped sharply during midday, suggesting a drying trend associated with increased solar insolation and offshore wind patterns, before rising again in the evening. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the early morning hours, peaking midday, then a notable drop in the late afternoon before recovering, which may signal a passing weather front or localized atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially indicating a change in pressure gradients linked to coastal dynamics. These combined factors suggest the onset of a more dynamic weather regime, with potential for shifting cloud cover and temperature fluctuations in the coming hours.
