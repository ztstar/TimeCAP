Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for fog or drizzle. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a gradual decline, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with variable directions, but showed a shift toward more southerly and easterly flows in the afternoon, hinting at the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined conditions suggest a transition toward potentially inclement weather, including possible precipitation, with the strongest impacts likely in the coming hours.
