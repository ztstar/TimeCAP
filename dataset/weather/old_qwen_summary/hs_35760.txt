Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, before dropping markedly as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the early morning and into the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, which may signal a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends point to dynamic atmospheric conditions, potentially leading to unstable weather, including the risk of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
