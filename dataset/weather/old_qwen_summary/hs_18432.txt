Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture and a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began a slow decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system. Wind speeds were generally low and variable, with a notable reduction in the early morning and a return to light winds later, while wind direction shifted from northerly to westerly and then southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass flow. These patterns suggest a transition from a stable, moist nocturnal boundary layer to a drier, more unstable daytime environment, which could increase the risk of localized afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are present.
