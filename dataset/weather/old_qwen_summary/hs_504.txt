Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning and remained elevated through midday, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during the night. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, potentially signaling the arrival of a moist air mass. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a warmer, breezier afternoon, with reduced cloud cover and improved visibility later in the day.
