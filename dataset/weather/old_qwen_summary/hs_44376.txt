Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late morning before declining again, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal moisture buildup followed by daytime drying. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from northerly to westerly and eventually southerly directions, with reduced speeds during the night and a resurgence in the late afternoon, potentially signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends suggest the onset of a transitional weather period, possibly leading to increased chances of thunderstorms or showers in the near term.
