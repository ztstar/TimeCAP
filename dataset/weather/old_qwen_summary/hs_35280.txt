Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking just before midday, suggesting the presence of moist air influx, which could lead to discomfort and potential for thunderstorm development. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southeast, signaling possible convective activity or a change in atmospheric pressure systems. Air pressure remained stable through the early morning but began to decline in the evening, a pattern often associated with approaching storms or frontal systems. These combined factors—rising temperatures, high humidity, increasing wind speeds, and falling pressure—point to a heightened likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
