Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift from a more stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increasing humidity and cloud development. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief but strong surge in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined signals point to a dynamic atmospheric transition, potentially setting the stage for unsettled weather, including the possibility of thunderstorms, in the coming hours.
