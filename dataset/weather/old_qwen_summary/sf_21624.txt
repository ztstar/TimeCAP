Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before beginning a moderate decline, indicating the presence of persistent low-level moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant storm systems or frontal activity in the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and southeasterly, consistent with a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a developing marine layer influence, likely contributing to fog formation and cool, damp conditions that are typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
