Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near dawn before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer, drier air. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southwest to more variable and eventually northeasterly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to a warmer, drier, and more stable environment, typical of midday to evening patterns in the region.
