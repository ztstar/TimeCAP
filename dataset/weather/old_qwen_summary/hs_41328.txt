Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a minimum during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged notably during the overnight period, peaking sharply in the early morning, indicating the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the night, reaching its lowest point before beginning to stabilize, which may suggest an approaching low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions, including the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
