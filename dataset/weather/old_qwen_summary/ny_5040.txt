Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning, indicating a cooling trend followed by a gradual warming phase. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with a shift to more variable and moderate winds later in the day, accompanied by changing wind directions suggesting shifting air masses. These combined patterns indicate a transition period, potentially leading to overcast or light precipitation conditions in the near term.
