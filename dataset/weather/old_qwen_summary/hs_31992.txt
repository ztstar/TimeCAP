Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by cloud cover and precipitation. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, indicating saturated air conditions, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility in the early hours. A marked decrease in air pressure during the late night and early morning was observed, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a surge in wind speed, signaling the passage of a weather front. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to more easterly and then to a strong southerly flow later in the day, consistent with an approaching low-pressure system. These combined indicators suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions to more dynamic and potentially stormy weather, with elevated risks for thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the near term.
