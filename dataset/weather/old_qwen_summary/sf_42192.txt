Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, particularly during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions. Wind patterns shifted from westerly and northwesterly flows during the evening to more variable and southerly directions in the late afternoon, with a notable increase in wind speed in the final hours, possibly signaling the onset of a change in weather. These dynamics suggest that while the city enjoyed relatively stable and mild conditions overall, a transition toward potentially more dynamic weather—possibly with increasing wind and cloud cover—may be approaching.
