Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a gradual cooling trend, indicating a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a possible frontal passage or shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the day, stabilizing at higher levels by late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the morning, potentially signaling changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with reduced chances of precipitation but ongoing warmth.
