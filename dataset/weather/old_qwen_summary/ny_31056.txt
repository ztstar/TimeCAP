Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with a sharp rise during the night and early morning, likely indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which then dropped sharply as temperatures climbed. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to recover, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the northeast and southeast, signaling a shift in wind patterns consistent with a developing frontal influence. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with the possibility of precipitation later in the day.
