Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and intensified through the afternoon. Humidity levels remained persistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, reaching a low point in the late evening, which is characteristic of an approaching weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased notably during mid-morning and early afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with frontal passage. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the immediate hours ahead.
