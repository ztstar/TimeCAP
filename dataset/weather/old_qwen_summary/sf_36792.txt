Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp temperature increase in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of warmer air. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent marine influence, with a notable drop during midday possibly linked to a change in air mass. Air pressure declined steadily through the night, reaching a low point in the early hours before rebounding significantly in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds remained low and calm for most of the period, with a sudden increase in the final hours, particularly from the west and northwest, potentially bringing in a new air current. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and then to northwesterly suggests a dynamic atmospheric shift, possibly indicating the onset of a changing weather pattern that could influence future conditions.
