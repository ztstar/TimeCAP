Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from saturated conditions to drier air, likely due to an influx of warm, dry air mass. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a drop in wind speed, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system or a weakening high-pressure ridge. Wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly, aligning with changing pressure gradients and potential storm development. These combined trends point toward a dynamic atmospheric setup, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
