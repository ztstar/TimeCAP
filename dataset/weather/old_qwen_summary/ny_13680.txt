Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn before gradually rising again during the day. Humidity levels increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more moist air, likely due to changing wind patterns and a possible approaching front. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system moving into the region, which often brings unstable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, consistent with the development of a frontal boundary. These combined trends point to an active weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
