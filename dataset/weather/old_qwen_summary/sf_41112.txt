Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a thick fog layer that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, followed by a decline in the late afternoon, signaling a transition from high-pressure dominance to a weakening system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, particularly around dawn, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, consistent with a sea breeze developing. These patterns collectively indicate the influence of coastal fog and sea breeze circulation, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for continued cool, moist conditions into the evening.
