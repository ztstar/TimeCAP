Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the mid-morning and steadily declining through the night before a slight rebound in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the final six hours, indicating the approaching influence of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief increase in the evening, while wind direction shifted dramatically from west-southwest to northeast and then back to the west, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a transition in weather dynamics, likely heralding a shift toward more maritime air influence and potential for fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
