Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a strong high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, clear conditions in the afternoon. Wind patterns shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from northerly to southerly and then to easterly directions, which may have facilitated the influx of marine air and influenced fog formation. These combined factors point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with marine layer development overnight and clearing during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate dynamics.
