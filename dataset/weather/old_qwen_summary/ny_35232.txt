Over the past 24 hours, a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, followed by a gradual decline, suggests a transition from a saturated air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours indicates radiative cooling, likely under clear skies before cloud cover returned. Air pressure showed a steady increase, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, fair weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in flow possibly linked to frontal passage. The combination of cooling temperatures, increasing pressure, and stronger northerly winds points to the potential for improving conditions, though residual moisture may lead to morning fog or drizzle.
