Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the early hours before declining slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting possible fog or low cloud development. Air pressure showed a consistent rise from the early morning through the afternoon, indicating improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the mid-afternoon, especially in the evening hours, with strong southerly and easterly gusts likely driven by regional pressure gradients. These combined patterns point to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, breezier weather, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal coastal climate.
