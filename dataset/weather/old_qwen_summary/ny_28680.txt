Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that has brought increasingly unstable conditions. Temperature steadily rose throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon before beginning to decline, suggesting a warming trend followed by a cooling phase as the system evolved. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly during the midday and early evening, contributing to a muggy feel and increasing the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast to south-southwest, aligning with the storm’s circulation pattern. These combined factors point to an active weather system likely bringing showers or thunderstorms in the near term, with potential for gusty winds and a noticeable drop in temperature as the front passes through.
