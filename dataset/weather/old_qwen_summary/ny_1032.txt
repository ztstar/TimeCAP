Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high during the initial phase, dropping sharply in the late afternoon before fluctuating, suggesting a shift in moisture content possibly linked to a passing weather system. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decrease followed by a sharp rise, signaling the passage of a low-pressure front and the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns consistent with a cold front moving through. These combined trends point to a transition from mild, damp conditions to cooler, drier air, likely resulting in improved visibility and a more comfortable environment by morning.
