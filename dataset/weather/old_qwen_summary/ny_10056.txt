Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, indicating the passage of a cold front followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a drying trend associated with the warming air mass. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic spike in the afternoon, marking the arrival of a strong high-pressure system, which typically brings clear and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, consistent with the influence of the high-pressure system. Overall, the data indicates a transition from cold, humid conditions to warmer, drier, and more stable weather, likely resulting in improved visibility and calm conditions later in the day.
