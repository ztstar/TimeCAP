- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, reflecting a significant and consistent increase in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. The growth rate intensifies in the final weeks, with a sharp jump in the most recent period, suggesting a possible surge in influenza activity. This pattern indicates a current high level of circulation, which may strain healthcare resources and underscores the need for heightened public health surveillance and intervention.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator shows a clear and sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in growth during the final quarter of the period, suggesting a rapidly escalating influenza A activity. The data reveals a significant departure from baseline levels, with a sharp increase in the latter half, indicating a potential peak in the current respiratory virus season. This pattern implies heightened transmission, increased healthcare demand, and the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, public health preparedness, and resource allocation.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked intensification in the final quarter of the period, suggesting a significant surge in influenza B activity. The most notable increase occurs in the last five weeks, where values rise sharply from a moderate baseline to an exceptionally high peak, indicating a potential outbreak or epidemic phase. This pattern underscores an urgent need for enhanced surveillance, public health preparedness, and resource allocation to manage the growing burden on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final six weeks, suggesting a rapidly growing influenza activity. The progression from moderate levels to a significant spike indicates the onset of a strong seasonal surge, likely nearing or surpassing peak transmission. This sharp increase raises public health concerns and underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, clinical preparedness, and vaccination efforts to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the latter half, suggesting a significant increase in influenza A activity. The transition from moderate levels to high prevalence, particularly in the final five weeks, indicates a possible peak or surge in influenza transmission. This rapid rise may signal the onset of a severe seasonal influenza wave, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the need for urgent public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapid increase in influenza B activity. A sharp rise from week 16 onward, culminating in the highest recorded levels, indicates a potential epidemic peak or early phase of an outbreak. This trend underscores an urgent need for heightened surveillance, public health preparedness, and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of influenza B.
