Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked diurnal variation, peaking during early morning hours and dropping sharply during daylight, indicating the influence of marine layer dynamics and fog dissipation. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained within a narrow range, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no major storm systems affecting the region. Wind patterns were generally light and variable, with brief periods of stronger wind activity likely associated with shifts in local coastal breezes and temporary surges from the north or east. These combined factors point to a typical coastal weather pattern, where cooler nighttime temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and weak winds contribute to the formation and dissipation of fog, particularly in the early morning hours.
