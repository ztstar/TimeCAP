Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely led to fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a sustained decline through the night, stabilizing after a brief dip, consistent with a low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a change in airflow patterns, possibly from a northerly to a westerly flow. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and calm period to a more unstable and potentially stormy atmosphere, with conditions conducive to precipitation later in the day.
