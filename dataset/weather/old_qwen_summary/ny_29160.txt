Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels climbed sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation before dropping abruptly, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden front or precipitation event. Air pressure rose significantly overnight, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that likely brought clear and stable conditions. Wind speeds decreased during the night and early morning, then increased again in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a cold, damp, and stable air mass to a drier, gradually warming environment, consistent with the approach of a high-pressure ridge.
