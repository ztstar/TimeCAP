Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects the onset of daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a notable decline during the afternoon and evening, suggesting drier air masses may be moving in, which could reduce the likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure gradually increased, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly, possibly indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined factors suggest improving weather conditions with reduced cloud cover and a lower risk of thunderstorms, though lingering warmth may maintain a muggy feel during the day.
