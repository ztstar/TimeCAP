Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s frequent marine layer influence. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by rising wind speeds and shifting wind directions, pointing to the arrival of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind patterns shifted from variable and weak earlier in the day to stronger and more persistent from the west and northwest, reinforcing the likelihood of coastal upwelling and increased marine influence. These conditions together indicate a transition from a stable, foggy night to a potentially more dynamic and variable afternoon, with possible overcast skies and a chance of light coastal showers.
