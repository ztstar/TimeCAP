Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to a dense, persistent fog or mist that lingered into the early morning. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more variable, suggesting a change in air mass dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more ventilated daytime regime, potentially signaling the approach of a drier air mass or a shift in regional weather patterns.
