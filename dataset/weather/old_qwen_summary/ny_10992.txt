Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a period of strong cooling that likely coincided with the passage of a cold front. A notable spike in humidity at night, combined with a sharp decline in air pressure, suggests the arrival of a low-pressure system, which often brings unstable weather and precipitation. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night, particularly from the northwest, aligning with the storm's approach and contributing to the temperature drop. The subsequent rise in pressure and stabilization of wind conditions in the late afternoon and evening point to the system moving away, clearing skies and allowing for a gradual warming trend. These changes collectively indicate a brief but impactful weather event, likely involving rain or snow, followed by a return to milder and more stable conditions.
