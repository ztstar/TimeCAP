Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature swing, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before rising steadily through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic inversion, starting high in the early hours, plummeting during midday, and rising again in the evening, indicating a shift from foggy or moist conditions to drier, clearer air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased notably in the early morning before a sharp drop in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind patterns revealed strong, variable gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, with a consistent shift from westerly to northerly and then easterly directions, likely tied to coastal upwelling and changing pressure systems. These dynamics point to a transitional weather period, likely bringing clearing skies and a return to typical coastal conditions, with potential for early morning fog dissipation and enhanced breezes during the day.
