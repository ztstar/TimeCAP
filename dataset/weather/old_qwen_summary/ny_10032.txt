Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady and significant drop in temperature, suggesting the arrival of a cold air mass. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early hours, followed by a sharp decline, indicating a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure began to rise gradually through the night and early morning, then surged dramatically in the late afternoon before falling again, likely signaling the passage of a strong weather system. Wind speeds remained consistently low until late afternoon, when they abruptly increased, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, which may indicate a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends suggest the city underwent a dynamic weather shift, possibly bringing colder, drier, and windier conditions, with implications for potential winter weather or storm development.
