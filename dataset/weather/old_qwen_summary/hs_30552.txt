Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking during the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high through the night and early morning, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions, but began a steady decline in the afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a changing weather pattern. Wind speeds were generally low at night, increasing during the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined changes suggest the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as the warming trend and shifting wind patterns promote convective instability.
