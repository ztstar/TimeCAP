Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions likely associated with fog or mist, which gradually diminished as temperatures rose. A consistent rise in atmospheric pressure throughout the day suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, contributing to stable and increasingly clear conditions. Wind activity showed a shift from light and variable in the early morning to stronger, more consistent easterly to southerly flow in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling a developing sea breeze or frontal influence. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cool night to a warmer, drier, and more stable day, typical of late spring or early summer conditions in the region.
