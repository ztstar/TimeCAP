Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased discomfort. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, stabilizing during the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds decreased significantly through the night and remained light throughout the day, with wind directions shifting gradually from northerly to easterly, consistent with a weakening synoptic-scale flow. The combination of high humidity, moderate temperatures, and stable atmospheric pressure points to a relatively calm and humid weather regime, with little potential for precipitation or severe weather in the near term.
