Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and morning solar warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the late night and early morning, suggesting dry air intrusion, which may have contributed to clearer skies and reduced fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, a sign of approaching high-pressure dominance that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds fluctuated with periods of stronger gusts, particularly in the morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions from the northwest to west-southwest, hinting at changing airflow patterns. Collectively, these trends point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely resulting in improved visibility and mild, sunny conditions in the coming hours.
