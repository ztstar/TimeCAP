Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly and stabilizing at lower levels in the early morning hours. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, peaking in the early morning and indicating the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of coastal conditions. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the northwest occurred around midnight, suggesting a change in air mass, likely driven by marine layer dynamics. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, remaining stable overall but with a brief drop during the foggy hours, consistent with the approach of a moist marine air mass. These combined patterns point to a classic coastal fog event influenced by the interaction of cool ocean air and warmer land temperatures, which may persist into the morning with reduced visibility and a damp, chilly feel.
