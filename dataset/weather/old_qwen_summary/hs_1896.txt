Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. A notable pressure decrease occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a sudden increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south, indicating the possible approach of a frontal system or storm activity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and strong winds raises the likelihood of thunderstorm development, especially in the evening hours. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward unstable weather, warranting caution for residents due to potential for heavy rain, gusty winds, and localized flooding.
