Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture layer that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a brief spike before declining again, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased markedly during the night, particularly in the early hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, pointing to dynamic atmospheric changes and possible inflow of cooler air. These combined patterns suggest the influence of a passing frontal system, which could lead to unstable conditions and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and lift persist.
