Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady increase in humidity, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, peaking at saturation levels, which suggests the onset of fog or low cloud cover. Temperature trends showed a gradual warming throughout the day, with the lowest values recorded during the early morning hours and a notable rise in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal air masses. Air pressure steadily declined, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by a shift toward southerly and easterly directions, which often accompany marine layer dynamics in the region. These combined factors point to a coastal weather transition, likely resulting in persistent fog, cooler temperatures, and potentially stronger onshore winds in the coming hours.
