Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking around dawn before declining, with a secondary increase late in the evening, indicating possible moisture influx or dew point changes. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more westerly and then a northerly direction, accompanied by variable speeds, which may have contributed to the temperature and humidity fluctuations. These changes collectively point to the influence of a passing frontal system, likely bringing cooler, more humid conditions with the potential for precipitation later in the day.
