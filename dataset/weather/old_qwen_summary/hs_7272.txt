Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by atmospheric stability. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation in the early hours, suggesting conditions favorable for fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the persistent low visibility and cool feel. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late evening and early morning, followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system or front that may have brought moisture and instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the early evening, particularly from the northwest and west, which may have transported cooler, drier air into the region, disrupting the overnight buildup of humidity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass that could lead to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
