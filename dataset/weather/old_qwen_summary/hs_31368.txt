Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining, which suggests the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and eventually more variable, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics possibly linked to a frontal boundary. Combined, these trends point to a transition period where moisture and wind shifts may elevate the risk of localized showers or thunderstorms, particularly if instability develops overnight.
