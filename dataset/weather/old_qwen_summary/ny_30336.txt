Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, indicating a cold nocturnal period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, coinciding with the coldest temperatures, suggesting condensation or fog formation potential. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the night and into the morning, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing significantly during the early hours before increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with directional shifts indicating a transition from northerly to more easterly and southerly flow. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising pressure, and changing wind patterns suggests the arrival of a stable, dry air mass, likely bringing clearer skies and improving conditions for the remainder of the day.
