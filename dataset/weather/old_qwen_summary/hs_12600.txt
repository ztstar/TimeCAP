Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a possible clearing of moist air. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which suggests the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift to more southerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with a developing storm system. These trends collectively point to an active weather pattern, with the potential for thunderstorms or heavy precipitation later in the day.
