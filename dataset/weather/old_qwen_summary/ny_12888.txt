Over the past 24 hours, temperatures have steadily declined, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to a cold air mass settling over the region. Humidity levels began low but increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping again, suggesting possible nighttime condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual rise, culminating in a sustained high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly, hinting at a changing flow pattern associated with the advancing high-pressure system. Overall, the data suggests a clear, cooling trend with improving conditions, though residual moisture and variable winds may affect morning visibility and comfort.
