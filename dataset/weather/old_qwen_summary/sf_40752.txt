Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant variability, starting high and dropping sharply during the early morning, then rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. Air pressure exhibited a generally stable pattern with minor fluctuations, though a brief rise followed by a dip may indicate the passage of a weak weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southwest, potentially bringing in maritime air and influencing coastal fog patterns. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests possible synoptic-scale adjustments, which could impact fog development and overall coastal air quality.
