Temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to cooler temperatures and stable air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, which is associated with fair weather and a diminishing chance of precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light, with minor fluctuations, and wind direction shifted progressively from southerly to easterly, consistent with a weakening low-pressure influence. Overall, the data point to a transition toward stable, dry, and gradually warming conditions, favorable for clear skies and comfortable daytime temperatures.
