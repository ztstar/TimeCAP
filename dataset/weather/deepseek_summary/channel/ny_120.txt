- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced nocturnal surge, peaking sharply during the early morning hours before declining steadily through the day. A notable dip occurred in the mid-to-late afternoon, followed by a modest recovery in the evening, suggesting diurnal variability typical of urban environments with changing thermal dynamics. The sustained high values during nighttime and the rapid drop during daylight hours indicate strong influence from temperature inversion and reduced air mixing, which may contribute to discomfort and potential impacts on air quality and health.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a steady downward trend over the initial 16 hours, indicating the potential approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. A sharp rebound occurred between the 17th and 24th hours, suggesting the system may be moving out or that high-pressure air is re-establishing, potentially leading to improving weather. The fluctuation near the end of the period, including a temporary dip followed by recovery, reflects dynamic atmospheric adjustments that could signal ongoing instability or transitioning weather patterns.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, reaching a trough before sharply increasing during midday, indicating a significant diurnal pattern likely influenced by solar heating. A notable anomaly occurred in the late afternoon, with a rapid drop following the peak, suggesting possible cloud cover or a shift in air mass. The overall trend reflects a strong daily cycle, with the highest values occurring around midday and the lowest in the early morning, consistent with typical urban heat dynamics.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a steady increase over the 24-hour period, transitioning from low values in the early hours to a peak in the latter half, indicating a progressive intensification of wind conditions. A notable anomaly occurred during the initial phase with a temporary drop to near-zero levels, suggesting a brief lull or sheltered airflow, followed by a rapid resurgence. The sustained high wind speeds in the final hours imply a developing or ongoing weather system, potentially signaling the approach of a storm or frontal passage, which could impact outdoor activities and infrastructure.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction has exhibited a pronounced shift from northerly to southerly sectors, transitioning through easterly and westerly extremes, indicating dynamic atmospheric adjustments. A notable pivot occurred around the 10th hour, with winds rotating sharply from a northeasterly to a southwesterly flow, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or localized pressure gradient change. The sustained southwest flow in the final hours, culminating in a near-western direction, points to potential stabilization or the influence of a developing high-pressure system.
