Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating an approaching weather system, likely associated with a low-pressure front moving into the region. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, driven by southerly and westerly flows, before subsiding in the afternoon, consistent with a weakening frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly suggests changing air mass influences, which could signal an imminent change in weather conditions, potentially bringing clearer skies or increased coastal fog.
