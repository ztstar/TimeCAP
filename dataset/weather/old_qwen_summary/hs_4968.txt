Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day and peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to decline. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high into midday, which contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable feel, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest to south-southeast directions, suggesting the onset of a shift in air mass. These combined conditions point to a developing weather pattern conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the high moisture content and atmospheric instability.
