Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, then dropped significantly in the morning, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a minimum around dawn, before beginning to rise again, signaling the influence of a low-pressure system that has since started to dissipate. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, likely due to a frontal passage or developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest and then back to the west indicates changing airflow patterns consistent with a passing weather front, which may bring unsettled conditions later in the day.
