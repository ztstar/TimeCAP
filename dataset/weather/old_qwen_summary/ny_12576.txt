Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning and remained elevated through midday before dropping slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses. Air pressure declined steadily throughout the period, particularly after midnight, pointing to the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, consistent with storm development. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a dynamic and potentially stormy weather pattern, likely due to the intrusion of a frontal system.
