Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-to-late morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and possible approaching weather changes. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with calm conditions during the early hours, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and then back to the northwest. These patterns point to a transition period, potentially bringing fog or overcast conditions in the near term, consistent with San Francisco’s typical coastal weather dynamics.
