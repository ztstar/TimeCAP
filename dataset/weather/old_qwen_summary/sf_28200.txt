Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. This was accompanied by a sharp increase in humidity and sustained high wind speeds, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting strong onshore flow and possible coastal fog development. Temperature trends revealed a cold period followed by a gradual warming, especially during the afternoon, likely due to a mix of solar heating and changing wind patterns. Wind direction shifted significantly, with a pronounced southerly to westerly flow during peak instability, consistent with marine layer dynamics. These conditions collectively indicate an active marine influence, with a high likelihood of foggy mornings and variable, breezy conditions persisting into the current period.
