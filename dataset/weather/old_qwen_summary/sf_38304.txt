Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, accompanied by wind shifts toward the northwest and then northeast, indicates the passage of a low-pressure system or marine layer influence. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief spikes during the night and early morning, consistent with coastal dynamics and the influence of the prevailing sea breeze. The combination of saturated air, cooling temperatures, and variable wind direction points to persistent marine layer conditions, likely resulting in foggy or overcast conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
