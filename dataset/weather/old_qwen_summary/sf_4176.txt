Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a significant temperature inversion or marine layer dynamics typical of coastal conditions. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours coincided with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. The return of higher pressure and calmer winds in the late afternoon suggests a temporary stabilization, possibly clearing skies and lifting the marine layer. These patterns point to a dynamic coastal weather cycle, with strong implications for visibility, commute conditions, and temperature fluctuations across the region.
