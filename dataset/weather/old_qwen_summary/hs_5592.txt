Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, maintaining near-saturated conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm periods and variable direction, but increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the south and southeast, which may signal the onset of a developing sea breeze. The combination of rising temperatures, weakening winds, and declining humidity suggests a transition toward more stable and potentially muggy conditions later in the day.
