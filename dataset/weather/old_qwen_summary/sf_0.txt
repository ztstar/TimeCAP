Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool coastal conditions to warmer inland-like temperatures. Humidity dropped sharply in the afternoon, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, suggesting the influence of a drying breeze or subsiding marine layer. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the early afternoon, followed by a sharp drop and subsequent recovery, signaling the passage of a weather system, likely a low-pressure trough. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from northerly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with a change in regional wind patterns. These changes collectively point to a dynamic shift in local weather, potentially bringing stronger winds and more variable conditions later in the day.
