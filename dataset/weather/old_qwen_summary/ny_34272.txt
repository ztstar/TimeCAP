Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking near saturation around dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a noticeable dampness in the air. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the day, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which typically brings clear and calm weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in direction from the northwest to the southeast during the night, followed by a reversal to the southwest and then westward in the early morning, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a damp, cool night to a gradually warming and stable day, likely resulting in improving visibility and a decrease in precipitation risk.
