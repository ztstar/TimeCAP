Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early hours but dropped sharply in the midday, suggesting a drying trend likely due to warming and improved air circulation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon, particularly from the northwest and west, coinciding with a shift in wind direction that may indicate changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds points to improving conditions, with a likely transition toward a drier and more settled weather pattern in the coming hours.
