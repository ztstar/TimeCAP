Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining through the night before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity remained high throughout most of the period, particularly during the night and early morning hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend during the day, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting improving weather conditions and possible clearing of low-level clouds. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a period of calm conditions, followed by increasing wind strength in the afternoon, driven by shifting wind directions from west to south-southeast, possibly indicating a change in local wind patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and variable wind patterns suggests the influence of a marine layer, typical of San Francisco's climate, with potential for foggy conditions in the early morning and a gradual clearing as the day progressed.
