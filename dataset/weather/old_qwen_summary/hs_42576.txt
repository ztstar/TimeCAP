Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or mist formation during the night. Air pressure showed a period of steady increase through midday, followed by a slight drop in the late evening, hinting at the possible approach or passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly during the night, with a notable increase in speed and a change in direction in the late evening, which could signal a change in air mass or the onset of a frontal influence. Overall, the combination of high humidity, temperature rebound, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for unstable conditions and a possible afternoon thunderstorm threat later today.
