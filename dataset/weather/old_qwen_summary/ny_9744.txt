Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, peaking during the coldest part of the night, which suggests favorable conditions for fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with gusts from the northwest and west, likely transporting cooler air into the region. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly patterns, combined with the cooling trend and rising humidity, points to a cold front passage, which may lead to dry, crisp conditions in the coming hours.
