Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising during the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds in the morning. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the afternoon, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds dropped significantly during the early morning hours and remained light through midday, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, reflecting changing air mass influences. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and moderate humidity suggests improving weather conditions, with likely sunny skies and a return to more comfortable temperatures later in the day.
