Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant overnight temperature drops. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely due to nocturnal condensation or nearby moisture sources. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low at night but increased during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, which may reflect changing synoptic conditions. These combined patterns—rising humidity, diminishing pressure, and increasing winds—point to a developing weather shift, possibly indicating the onset of unstable conditions conducive to thunderstorm activity later in the day.
