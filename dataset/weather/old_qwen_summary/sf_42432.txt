Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained stable throughout the day, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement, though a minor fluctuation coincided with the shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift from westerly to northerly and then southerly directions, hinting at dynamic local circulation changes possibly linked to coastal influences. These conditions collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern characterized by cool, foggy nights and a gradual warming trend during the day, influenced by maritime air masses and topography.
