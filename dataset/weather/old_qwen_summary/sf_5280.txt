Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, indicating persistent marine influence, before sharply decreasing in the afternoon as a shift in air mass occurred. Air pressure showed a steady increase following a brief drop, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and reduced wind speeds later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from near-zero during the overnight hours to moderate to strong westerly and southwesterly flows in the afternoon, likely driven by offshore pressure gradients. These changes point to a transition from a foggy, moist marine layer to a drier, windier, and more stable afternoon regime—typical of San Francisco’s diurnal weather cycle.
