Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating the presence of moist air and potentially favorable conditions for fog or low cloud cover. A brief but significant increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, though pressure subsequently declined, hinting at possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and easterly, signaling a change in air mass flow that may contribute to moisture influx. Together, these patterns suggest a transition period with lingering damp conditions and the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
