Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, likely due to marine layer development. Air pressure dropped significantly in the early morning, signaling the approach of a weather system that may have contributed to the increased moisture and reduced wind speeds. Wind speeds were generally low except for brief periods of stronger gusts, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting localized atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly sectors points to a complex interaction between coastal influences and regional airflow patterns.
