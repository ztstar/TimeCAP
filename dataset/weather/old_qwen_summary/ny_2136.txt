Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before beginning a gradual rise in the morning, indicating a cold nocturnal period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the early hours before sharply increasing in the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the approach of a moist air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, culminating in a significant drop that signals the arrival of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with cyclonic circulation around the developing low. These combined trends point to a developing storm system bringing increasing cloud cover, precipitation likelihood, and potential for strong winds in the coming hours.
