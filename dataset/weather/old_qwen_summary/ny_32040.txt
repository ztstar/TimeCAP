Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moist air, which likely contributed to lower visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day before a slight drop in the final hours, indicating a possible approaching weather change. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the west and southwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a dynamic air mass. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly suggests a complex atmospheric shift that could precede changing precipitation patterns or a shift in overall weather conditions.
