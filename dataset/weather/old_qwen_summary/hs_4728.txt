Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or drizzle, particularly in the pre-dawn hours. A significant pressure rise occurred in the mid-to-late morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly, suggesting the influence of a changing airflow pattern. These combined dynamics point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, consistent with a frontal passage or subsidence inversion.
