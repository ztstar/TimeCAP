Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise during the night and early morning, then a gradual decline, consistent with the passage of a weak high-pressure system or changing frontal influence. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, reflecting changing local wind patterns, possibly due to thermal gradients or sea breeze reversal. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal fog pattern, with overnight cooling and high moisture leading to fog formation, followed by clearing and warming during the day.
