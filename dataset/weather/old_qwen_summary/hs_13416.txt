Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss and changing air mass dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, with distinct spikes indicating periods of moist air advection, followed by drier conditions later in the day, possibly associated with a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, especially in the final 12 hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, suggesting the influence of a developing surface boundary or frontal passage. The abrupt shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly to northwesterly, combined with the rapid temperature drop and pressure buildup, indicates a significant weather transition that could precede a period of cooler, drier, and potentially clearer skies.
