Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Temperature showed a gradual rise through the day, suggesting warming trends, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Air pressure exhibited minor fluctuations, with a slight drop toward the end of the period, which may signal the approach of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low throughout, with consistent light to moderate breezes, though occasional shifts in wind direction suggest changing local flow patterns. These combined conditions point to a stable yet potentially unstable atmospheric setup, raising the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
