Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cooling front. Humidity levels remained high initially, sharply declining after midday, which likely contributed to a noticeable improvement in perceived comfort as the day progressed. Air pressure increased steadily through the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which later weakened slightly, possibly due to local storm development. Wind speed and direction showed a shift from moderate, westerly flow to stronger, more variable winds with a southerly component in the late afternoon, hinting at dynamic atmospheric changes. These observations collectively suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions to a more unsettled pattern, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
