Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then southerly again, with sustained easterly and southeasterly flows in the early morning, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of increasing pressure, declining humidity, and steady winds suggests a transition toward clearer skies and drier conditions as the day progresses.
