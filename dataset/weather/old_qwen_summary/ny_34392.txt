Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the day, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a warming trend. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the late night and early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, potentially facilitating the transport of moist air. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cool night to a gradually warming, drier, and more stable day, with improving conditions expected in the near term.
