Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon but rising again in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass and possible convective activity. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach or dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally correlates with stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, potentially indicating changing synoptic conditions or local circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a warmer, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with conditions conducive to afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and instability persist.
