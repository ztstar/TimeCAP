Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, reaching near or at saturation levels, indicating a significant moisture presence in the atmosphere. Temperature remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent thermal profile. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system capable of triggering precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly wind directions, consistent with an inflow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors—high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing winds—point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
