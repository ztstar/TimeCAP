Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching and maintaining near-saturation conditions, which is consistent with fog formation common in the area during this time of year. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, suggesting the influence of a stable high-pressure system that has likely suppressed significant weather changes. Wind speeds remained low and variable during the night before increasing in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southwest to more southerly, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a sea breeze. These conditions collectively point to a foggy, cool, and stable coastal environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for dense morning fog that may clear as the day progresses.
