Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a sharp drop in the late night, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the late night and early morning, consistent with an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition in weather patterns, with the possibility of precipitation or storms developing in the near term.
