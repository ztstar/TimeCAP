Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal phase to a milder day. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a drying trend likely due to changes in wind patterns and air mass movement. Air pressure showed a pronounced rise, especially during midday, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the morning and midday, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting dynamic circulation changes associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. Overall, the observed trends point to improving weather conditions with reduced cloudiness and drier air, typical of a warming high-pressure dome dominating the region.
