Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with the lowest readings occurring in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has likely brought stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to more northerly and easterly patterns, hinting at changing circulation dynamics. Together, these trends suggest the approach of a dry, stable air mass with clearing skies and improving conditions, likely leading to a comfortable and sunny day ahead.
