Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature increase during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the onset of a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, indicating a strong overnight moisture buildup, followed by a sharp decline during midday, consistent with a drying trend as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant low-pressure system influence, which implies generally stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly during the late night and early morning, with sustained higher gusts, particularly from the west and northwest, suggesting possible boundary layer mixing or the influence of a passing frontal feature. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and southerly sectors may reflect changing air mass dynamics, potentially signaling a transition that could lead to instability and the development of afternoon thunderstorms.
