Over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover during the early hours. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and into the early morning, followed by a slight stabilization, pointing to an approaching weather system. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a notable increase in the late morning and afternoon, likely due to changing pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted dramatically from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, indicating a transition in air mass that may bring changing conditions later in the day.
