Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and maintaining a moist air mass that contributed to a muggy feel. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight drop in the early hours and a brief rise later, indicating a stable but slightly shifting atmospheric regime. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, generally consistent with light to breezy conditions, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest in the afternoon. These conditions suggest a stable high-pressure influence with minimal storm development, though increasing humidity and warming temperatures in the late period may support potential afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
