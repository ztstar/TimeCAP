Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily during the late afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for afternoon convection. Humidity remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drier air mass may be moving in. Air pressure showed a slight overall decline, particularly in the late evening, which could signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained generally stable, with consistent easterly to northeasterly flow, contributing to the transport of moist air from the Gulf Coast. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling pressure suggests a transition toward more unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
