Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in the early morning. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a brief rebound, indicating dynamic atmospheric changes possibly linked to an approaching weather system. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with near-calm conditions at dawn, but increased significantly in the afternoon, especially from the southeast, suggesting the influence of a developing coastal wind pattern. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable winds—point to a transition period likely bringing overcast skies and potential drizzle, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
