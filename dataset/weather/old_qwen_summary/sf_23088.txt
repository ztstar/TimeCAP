Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, declining slightly in the afternoon, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds that have begun to dissipate. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer environment, typical of late morning to afternoon conditions in the region.
