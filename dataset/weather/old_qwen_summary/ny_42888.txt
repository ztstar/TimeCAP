Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again during the day. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn before sharply dropping during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then began to rise steadily in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest. This change in wind pattern, combined with rising pressure and decreasing humidity, points toward improving weather conditions and a likely clearing of any lingering cloud cover by the next morning.
