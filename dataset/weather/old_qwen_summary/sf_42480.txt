Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A consistent drop in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that has since stabilized. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight hours, particularly from the southwest, with a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest, which may have facilitated the influx of marine air. These conditions together point to a typical marine layer event, common in San Francisco, bringing cool, damp conditions to the region, especially in coastal areas.
