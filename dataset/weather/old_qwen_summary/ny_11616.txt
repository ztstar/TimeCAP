Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of winter conditions. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum during the pre-dawn hours, followed by a slight recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. Combined, these indicators suggest a cold, drying trend following a period of increased moisture and stormy conditions, likely resulting in clearing skies and improving visibility by late afternoon.
