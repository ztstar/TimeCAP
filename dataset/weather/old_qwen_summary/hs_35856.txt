Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation in the early hours, remaining near maximum for several hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or dew formation and persistent damp conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds were generally light, with modest fluctuations, though brief periods of stronger winds occurred, particularly in the late night and early morning, likely due to shifting local circulation patterns. Wind direction shifted significantly throughout the period, transitioning from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, reflecting complex boundary layer dynamics and potential influence from a nearby frontal boundary.
