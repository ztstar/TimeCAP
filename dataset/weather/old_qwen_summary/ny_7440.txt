Over the past 24 hours, a notable drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply decreasing during the late morning, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a brief spike in the early hours, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system, which was followed by a more stable but slightly declining trend, consistent with the arrival of a weakening frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing during midday, but increased significantly in the late evening, particularly from the south-southeast, signaling potential gusty conditions. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest and then back toward the south suggests a complex flow pattern, possibly associated with low-level convergence and the potential for unsettled weather later in the day.
