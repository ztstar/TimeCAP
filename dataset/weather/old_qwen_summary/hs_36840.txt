Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a slight recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, peaking during the early hours and then dropping sharply, indicating a shift toward drier air conditions in the latter part of the period. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a notable surge in the early hours, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from northeast to north and then to the west, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition toward more stable and less humid conditions, which may reduce the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, offering a break from typical Houston summer weather patterns.
