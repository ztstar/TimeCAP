Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely due to the influence of a cold air mass moving into the region. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with near-saturation conditions during nighttime hours, increasing the likelihood of fog formation and a persistent damp feel. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by fluctuating but generally low pressure, suggesting the passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with intermittent calm periods and shifts in wind direction, particularly from the northwest to the southeast, which may have contributed to the transport of moist air. These combined factors point to a period of overcast, damp, and cool conditions, with potential for light precipitation and reduced visibility, especially during the overnight hours.
