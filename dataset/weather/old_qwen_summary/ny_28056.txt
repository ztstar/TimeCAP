Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong nocturnal heat loss. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the middle of the night, followed by a gradual recovery, which is characteristic of a passing weather system, likely a frontal passage. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late night and early morning, with sustained strong winds from the west to northwest, consistent with a developing storm system or cold front. The combination of falling pressure, rising winds, and a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to westerly points to the influence of a dynamic low-pressure system, which may have brought precipitation and cooler conditions earlier in the period.
