Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity remained consistently high through the early morning hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the midday, peaking in the late afternoon, which is often associated with improving weather and potential clearing skies. Wind speeds intensified through the late morning and afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, likely driven by a developing surface high-pressure system. This combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a shift toward drier and more stable conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
