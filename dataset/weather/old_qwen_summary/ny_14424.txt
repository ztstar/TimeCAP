Temperature showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Humidity increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of overnight moisture accumulation followed by drying. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in the late hours, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with storm development. These combined trends point to a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with increasing chances of precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
