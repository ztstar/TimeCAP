Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the day, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more convective air. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, then moderated during the day before picking up again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to developing disturbances. These combined factors suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment conducive to potential afternoon thunderstorms, especially as warm, moist air continues to accumulate during the day.
