Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the midday, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the northeast and northwest, likely driven by a developing surface pressure gradient. These conditions point to a drying trend and improving air quality, with reduced chances of precipitation and a higher likelihood of sunny, comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
