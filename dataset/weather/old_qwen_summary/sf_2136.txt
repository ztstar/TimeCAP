Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a more stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. A notable increase in wind speed occurred mid-morning, with sustained higher velocities in the afternoon, particularly around midday when gusts reached their highest recorded values. Wind direction shifted dramatically during the late night, transitioning from easterly to southerly, which may indicate the influence of a changing pressure gradient or coastal wind dynamics. The abrupt rise in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the passage of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to clearer skies and a reduction in wind intensity later in the day.
