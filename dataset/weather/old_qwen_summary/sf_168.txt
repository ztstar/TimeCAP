Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly, suggesting a period of fog formation and dissipation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to increased cloud cover and reduced wind speeds. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions persisting for several hours, but increased again in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest, signaling a shift in atmospheric circulation. The change in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly in the morning suggests a transition in air mass, potentially bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
