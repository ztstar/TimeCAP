Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight and early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and increased moisture content in the air. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then back to southerly, with the strongest winds observed in the early morning and late afternoon, potentially enhancing air mixing and dispersal of moisture. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and stable pressure suggests a risk of discomfort due to heat index and possibly the development of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
