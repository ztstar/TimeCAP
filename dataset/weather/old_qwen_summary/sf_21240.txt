Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the final six hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with brief increases in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition in weather conditions, likely bringing increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term.
