Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, then dropping sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting the air became drier with daytime warming. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and into the early afternoon, followed by a slight decline, signaling a stable high-pressure system that has likely brought settled conditions. Wind speeds were moderate in the early morning, decreased during the late night, and picked up again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, potentially indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests improving conditions, with a likely transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable afternoon weather.
