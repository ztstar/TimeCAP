Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting a transition from stable to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds remained low and consistent until midday, when they intensified slightly, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from cooler, more humid overnight conditions to milder, drier, and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
