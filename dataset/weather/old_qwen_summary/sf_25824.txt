Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping significantly overnight, reflecting a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed marked variability, starting high and decreasing through the morning, then rising again in the evening—indicative of marine layer formation and possible fog development. Air pressure remained relatively stable but gradually declined toward the end of the period, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening, particularly during the overnight hours, with gusts reaching peak intensity from the northwest, consistent with offshore flow and possible wind-driven fog. The shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly, combined with rising humidity and falling temperatures, points to an increasing likelihood of fog and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
