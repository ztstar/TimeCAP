Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with levels consistently near or at 100%, indicating high moisture content in the air and likely contributing to fog formation. Temperatures remained relatively stable during the early morning hours before a slight rise in the late afternoon, suggesting a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining slightly, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds increased steadily from light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, reinforcing marine influence and aiding in the movement of moist air inland. Combined, these conditions point to a persistent marine layer and potentially foggy or overcast conditions, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, especially during transitional periods between night and day.
