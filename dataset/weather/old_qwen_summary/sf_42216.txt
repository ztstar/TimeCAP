Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. These conditions collectively point to a transition period, with lingering marine influence and the potential for overcast or light precipitation in the near term.
