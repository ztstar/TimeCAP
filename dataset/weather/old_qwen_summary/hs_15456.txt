Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating favorable conditions for fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A gradual increase in air pressure suggests the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, generally associated with clearing skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, potentially signaling the arrival of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds points to a transition toward warmer, drier, and more unsettled conditions later in the day.
