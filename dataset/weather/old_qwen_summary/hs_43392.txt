Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to stable nighttime conditions and possible nocturnal fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south-southeast sector, consistent with the development of a daytime convective breeze or the onset of a sea breeze. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly in the final hours suggests changing synoptic influences, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or shifting pressure gradients.
