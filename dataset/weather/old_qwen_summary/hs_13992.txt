Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that may have contributed to the formation of fog or dew. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a significant rise midday, followed by a drop later in the evening, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system. Wind patterns were variable, with periods of calm interspersed with brief bursts of stronger winds from multiple directions, especially from the southeast and southwest, hinting at shifting air masses. Overall, the combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable wind suggests a dynamic and potentially unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of developing showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
