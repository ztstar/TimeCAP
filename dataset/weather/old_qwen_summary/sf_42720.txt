Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating a strong marine influence, with a sharp decline in the late afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to improving conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may indicate changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cooler, foggy marine layer to a drier, more stable air mass, typical of a summer afternoon in the Bay Area.
