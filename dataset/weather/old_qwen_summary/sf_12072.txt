Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping during the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no clear signs of an approaching storm system, but a slight increase in the afternoon may hint at improving conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the evening and morning, with a notable lull around dawn, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, consistent with coastal flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a typical marine-influenced climate pattern, with fog and cool temperatures likely persisting into the early morning hours.
