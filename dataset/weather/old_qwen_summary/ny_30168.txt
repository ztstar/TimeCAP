Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a significant cooling period during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which may have contributed to fog formation or reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by increasing wind speeds, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with the movement of a frontal boundary through the region. These combined factors suggest a transition period in New York City’s weather, likely bringing unsettled conditions such as precipitation or stronger winds in the near term.
