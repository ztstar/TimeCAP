The S&P 500 has demonstrated a strong upward trend over the past 20 trading days, reflecting sustained investor confidence and bullish market sentiment, particularly in the latter half of the period. The VIX has generally declined, signaling reduced market volatility and a shift toward complacency, though a brief spike mid-period suggests temporary risk aversion. Global equity markets, including the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, have shown resilience with steady gains, indicating broad-based optimism across major regions. Gold and crude oil futures have both trended higher, suggesting growing demand for safe-haven assets and inflationary concerns, while the weakening yen and stable-to-weaker euro have highlighted ongoing currency market shifts. The stable-to-depreciating Chinese yuan and fluctuating USD/JPY dynamics point to persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in Asia, which may influence global trade and capital flows in the near term.
