Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a stabilizing or slightly rising thermal pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, with prolonged saturation around 90%, suggesting persistent moisture in the air and a heightened likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase, peaking in the late evening, which generally signals improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified during the early evening hours, with gusts reaching notable levels, though wind directions varied significantly, hinting at shifting air masses. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind variability, and high humidity suggests that any recent precipitation may have subsided, with conditions trending toward drier and more stable weather in the near term.
