Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, indicating a stable, moist air mass, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, increasing notably in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly driven by frontal activity. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a milder, drier afternoon, with potential for clearer skies later in the day.
