Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a passing weather system, before stabilizing and decreasing in the late morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight rise during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stalled overhead. Wind activity intensified during the evening and early morning, with stronger and more consistent winds from the south and southwest, followed by a lull and then a resurgence of moderate winds from the west and south, indicating shifting atmospheric conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and variable wind patterns suggests a dynamic transition in weather, potentially heralding a change in conditions, such as clearing skies or the arrival of a new front.
