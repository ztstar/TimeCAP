Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. A pronounced drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to increased cloud cover and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with a consistent shift toward more southeasterly wind directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a transition period influenced by a frontal system, potentially leading to unstable weather and localized showers in the near term.
