Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture. A sustained drop in air pressure during the night and early morning indicates the approach of a weather system, likely associated with marine layer development. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm conditions, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more southerly and then variable, consistent with coastal airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to the influence of a persistent marine layer, contributing to cool, foggy mornings and potentially limiting afternoon warming.
