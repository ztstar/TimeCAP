Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early hours before decreasing again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northwest to southeast, suggesting changing air mass influences. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a moist, cooler overnight phase to a more stable, moderately breezy daytime environment.
