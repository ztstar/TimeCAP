Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-morning hours. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight rise in the early hours followed by a minor drop, indicating a steady high-pressure system in place. Wind patterns showed increasing intensity during the early morning, with strong easterly to southerly winds at dawn, followed by a dramatic lull in the mid-morning and a resurgence of moderate to strong winds from the west-southwest later in the day. These conditions suggest a transition influenced by marine layer dynamics, with the potential for lingering fog and cool, damp conditions through the remainder of the day.
