Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, with very low values during the midday hours and a sharp increase in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the influence of fog formation and coastal air mass changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning hours, with strong southwest to west winds preceding a sharp temperature drop, consistent with marine layer dynamics and coastal upwelling. The shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly in the evening, combined with rising humidity and falling pressure, points to the potential for fog development and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
