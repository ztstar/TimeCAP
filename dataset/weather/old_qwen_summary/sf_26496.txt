Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which supports the presence of dense fog and low cloud cover common to the region’s microclimate. A significant increase in wind speed occurred during the late morning and evening, particularly with strong gusts in the final hours, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with a passing weather system. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop later in the day, suggesting the approach and passage of a low-pressure front. These combined conditions—cool temperatures, high humidity, shifting winds, and fluctuating pressure—point to an active marine influence and the potential for continued fog, drizzle, or light precipitation, particularly in the coastal and northern parts of the city.
