Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually warming slightly. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, but a slight drop in the early morning may have contributed to the development of condensation. Wind patterns shifted gradually from southwest to more southerly and then easterly directions, consistent with coastal influences and the development of a marine layer. The combination of near-saturation humidity, cooling temperatures, and steady wind flow strongly supports the presence of dense fog, particularly affecting coastal and low-lying areas during the early morning hours.
