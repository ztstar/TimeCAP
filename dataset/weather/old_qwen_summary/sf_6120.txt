Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct diurnal temperature pattern, with nighttime cooling followed by a steady rise in temperatures during the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or high moisture content near the surface, consistent with coastal conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system building over the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts observed in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by thermal gradients and coastal influences. The shift in wind direction from variable to more southerly and westerly patterns indicates changing air mass dynamics, potentially signaling a transition toward more marine-influenced conditions.
