Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a transition from nighttime to daytime thermal patterns. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly after midday, reflecting the approach or passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, consistent with a developing southerly flow typical of humid, unstable conditions. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or heavy showers in the coming hours, especially given the moist, unstable air mass and dynamic wind shifts.
