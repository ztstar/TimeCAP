Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged during the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a return to near-normal levels, suggesting the passage of a weak frontal system or low-pressure trough. Wind speeds increased sharply in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by fog, cooling, and strengthening winds—typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability, especially during the summer months.
