Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels showed a significant increase, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which contributes to a muggy and uncomfortable feel. Air pressure exhibited a pronounced decline, reaching its lowest point in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system that may be associated with incoming storm activity. Wind speed and direction displayed fluctuating patterns, with bursts of stronger winds and shifts in direction, especially in the late evening, hinting at dynamic atmospheric changes and possible storm development. Collectively, these indicators point to a transition toward unstable weather conditions, potentially leading to thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
