Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the 22nd hour, followed by a rebound, which may signal the passage of a weak weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low except for a brief increase in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, possibly indicating a change in local circulation. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, slightly warmer regime, consistent with the onset of a clearer afternoon pattern.
