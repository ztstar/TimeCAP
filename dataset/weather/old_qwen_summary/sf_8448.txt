Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the mid-day and late afternoon, particularly in the evening hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow during the night and early morning, shifting to more easterly and southerly directions later in the day, possibly due to local topographic influences. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and a shift in wind direction points to a drying and stabilizing atmosphere, likely leading to improved visibility and favorable conditions for outdoor activities in the coming hours.
