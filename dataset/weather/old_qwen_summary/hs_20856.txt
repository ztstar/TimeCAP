Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of cooling, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to a noticeable damp chill and reduced comfort. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, suggesting a change in airflow that may precede a shift in weather patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, humid overnight period toward a more moderate and stable daytime environment, with minimal risk of precipitation or severe weather.
