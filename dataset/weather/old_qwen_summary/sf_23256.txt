Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during those hours. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout most of the day before a slight drop in the final hours, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns point to a typical marine layer influence, with dense fog and stable conditions dominating the night and early morning, giving way to clearer skies and mild warming as the day progressed.
