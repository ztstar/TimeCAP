Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating increasing atmospheric instability. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which enhances the potential for thunderstorm development. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring active weather. Wind speeds decreased toward the end of the period, but wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to easterly, indicating a change in air mass flow consistent with storm development. Together, these indicators suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially given the combination of warm, moist air and destabilizing pressure patterns.
