Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or the onset of a marine layer dissipation. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend, particularly in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind patterns exhibited variability, with stronger gusts in the late morning and early evening, and a notable shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south, potentially indicating a change in synoptic flow. These combined factors point to an active marine layer cycle, with potential for fog or overcast conditions early in the day and clearing skies later, affecting visibility and local temperatures.
