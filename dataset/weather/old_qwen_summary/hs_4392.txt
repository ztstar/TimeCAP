Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a strong moisture presence that likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern that could lead to scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
