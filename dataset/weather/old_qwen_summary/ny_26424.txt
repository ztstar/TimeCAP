Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity spiked significantly during the night, peaking at saturation levels, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and favorable weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at a possible change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds may portend developing cloud cover or the onset of precipitation later in the day.
