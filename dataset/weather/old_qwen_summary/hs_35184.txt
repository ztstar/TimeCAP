Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in temperature in the afternoon, indicating the arrival of a warm air mass. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, signaling a period of high moisture content, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility conditions. A steady increase in air pressure during the day suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low overnight, shifting to stronger northeasterly winds in the afternoon, consistent with a developing sea breeze or frontal passage. The change in wind direction from southeasterly to northeasterly and then to more easterly suggests a shift in atmospheric circulation, potentially indicating the approach of a weather system that could bring precipitation later.
