Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the late night and early morning, then increased sharply in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or the onset of moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds decreased steadily from midday onward, accompanied by a notable change in wind direction—from southerly to westerly and eventually to a northerly flow—indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends point to a transition from a warmer, more humid air mass to a cooler, drier one, likely leading to improving conditions and potentially clearer skies in the coming hours.
