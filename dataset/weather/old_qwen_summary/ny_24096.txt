Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels peaked during the late night and early morning, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late evening, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds points to improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air by the next day.
