Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon and evening, indicating a sharp nocturnal cooling event. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that condensed during cooler periods. A dramatic drop in air pressure during the early hours was followed by a strong rebound later in the day, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, likely accompanied by precipitation or storm activity. Wind speeds remained relatively consistent throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly and eventually westerly, aligning with the movement of the low-pressure system. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather pattern involving a cold front and possible precipitation, which could contribute to unsettled conditions in the near term.
