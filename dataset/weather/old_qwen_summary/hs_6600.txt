Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, followed by a sharp cooling trend overnight, suggesting a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which indicates a buildup of moisture possibly due to nocturnal dew point rise or a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the midday hours before gradually declining in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly direction by late evening, accompanied by a notable increase in speed toward the end of the period, which may indicate the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Together, these trends suggest a transition in atmospheric conditions that could lead to unstable weather, including potential thunderstorms, especially given the combination of high moisture levels and changing wind dynamics.
