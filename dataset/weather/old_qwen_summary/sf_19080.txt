Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures showing a consistent rise in the latter half of the period, indicating a shift toward more stable and mild conditions. Humidity remained consistently high throughout, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and overcast skies typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving in from the Pacific, which generally brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, signaling a transition in airflow patterns that may reduce coastal wind chill. Together, these trends suggest that the city is transitioning from a cool, foggy, and moist phase toward a clearer, milder, and more stable weather regime, with reduced wind and increasing comfort levels.
