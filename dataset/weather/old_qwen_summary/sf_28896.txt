Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Relative humidity remained near saturation for much of the period, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the night. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the early morning, followed by a rebound later in the day, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, consistent with onshore flow typical of coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. These combined factors suggest a period of marine influence, with potential for fog or drizzle, especially in low-lying coastal areas, particularly during the early morning hours.
