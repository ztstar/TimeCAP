Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a recovery, which may reflect the passage of a weak low-pressure system or shifting frontal boundaries. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the early morning and late evening, with strong southerly to westerly winds during the night and a shift to more variable, weaker winds during the day, consistent with the influence of the marine layer and diurnal wind cycle. The combination of temperature fluctuations, wind shifts, and pressure changes suggests an active coastal atmosphere, potentially leading to variable conditions such as fog, drizzle, or gusty winds in the coming hours.
