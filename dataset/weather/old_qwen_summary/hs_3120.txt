Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked in the overnight hours, remaining high through the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, reaching a peak just before dawn, then sharply declined in the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning and maintained strong, consistent flow from the west and northwest during the night, shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon, which may indicate a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather shift, with the potential for afternoon thunderstorms or rain as the low-pressure system moves in, especially given the prior high humidity and strong wind shear.
