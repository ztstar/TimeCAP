Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a possible fog or low cloud event that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a notable dip in the early hours, followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of more stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the overnight and early morning periods, shifting from predominantly westerly and southerly directions to more variable patterns by midday, consistent with coastal wind dynamics. These patterns point to a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, with implications for visibility, temperature stability, and local air quality.
