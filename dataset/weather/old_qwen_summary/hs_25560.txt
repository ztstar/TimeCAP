Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, humid night to a warmer, drier day. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, suggesting condensation or fog formation, then sharply declined, aligning with the temperature increase and the arrival of drier air. Air pressure declined significantly during the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly, which may have contributed to the development of localized showers or thunderstorms. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly, signaling a possible change in air mass or frontal passage. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather shift, with potential for unstable conditions later in the day.
