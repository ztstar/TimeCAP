Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the early hours. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred, with strong, consistent winds from the west and northwest during the night and early morning, likely driven by a coastal pressure gradient that weakened later in the day. Air pressure fluctuated, with a marked drop in the late evening that may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. The return of stronger winds toward the end of the period, combined with rising temperatures and falling humidity, suggests a transition toward clearer skies and drier conditions in the coming hours.
