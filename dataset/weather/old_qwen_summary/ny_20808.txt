Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels spiked to near saturation during the night, indicating possible precipitation or fog, which subsided during the afternoon as conditions became drier. Air pressure showed a sharp increase during the night, peaking above typical values, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds decreased steadily throughout the day, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to west and then southwesterly, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These indicators collectively suggest that a cold, dry high-pressure system has taken hold, likely leading to clear skies and cooler temperatures in the near term.
