Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco exhibited a distinct diurnal pattern, with a steady cooling trend through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating a transition from a more stable, moist environment to a drier, more variable one. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a sustained increase during the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts during the early morning and late evening, and wind directions shifted from southwesterly to northerly, possibly reflecting changing boundary layer dynamics. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cool, humid marine layer to a drier, warmer, and more stable atmosphere, typical of a clearing trend following fog or low clouds common in the region.
