Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal cycles. Humidity remained near saturation levels during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and relative humidity declined. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early morning, peaking in the midday, followed by a slight decline, hinting at a developing high-pressure system that may stabilize conditions. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, indicating changing airflow patterns possibly linked to a passing frontal system. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting winds suggests a transition period, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and instability persist.
