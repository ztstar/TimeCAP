Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a warmer daytime phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or dew formation. A marked decrease in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a recovery later in the day, signaling possible atmospheric instability and a developing weather system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a brief period of calm, but increased in the late afternoon, likely due to changing pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly suggests a change in air mass flow, potentially bringing in cooler or drier air, which could influence the development of afternoon thunderstorms.
