Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels were initially high, dropping sharply in the mid-morning before rising again in the evening, indicating a shift in moisture patterns possibly linked to a changing air mass. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, suggesting the arrival of a marine influence. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the mid-afternoon, followed by a decline, which may signal the passage of a weather system or the onset of changing conditions. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a stable, foggy marine layer to a more variable and potentially unsettled period, with implications for visibility and temperature fluctuations in the coming hours.
