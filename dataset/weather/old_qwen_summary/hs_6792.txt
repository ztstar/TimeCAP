Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of nocturnal moisture and the influence of daytime heating. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds remained moderate with notable shifts in direction, transitioning from westerly to southerly and then to easterly in the late night, potentially indicating a change in air mass or frontal passage. These combined trends suggest a dynamic shift in atmospheric conditions, possibly leading to unstable weather, including the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially if moisture and lift continue to increase.
