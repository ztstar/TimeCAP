Temperature trends show a consistent cooling overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with frontal passage and enhanced atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly suggests changing air flow patterns, potentially indicating the influence of a developing storm system affecting the region.
