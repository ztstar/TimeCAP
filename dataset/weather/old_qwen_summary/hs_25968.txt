Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with southeast and south winds dominating overnight, transitioning to more variable and lighter winds during the day, which may have limited air mixing and contributed to localized stagnation. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a potential for fog or low clouds in the morning hours and a gradual improvement in air quality and comfort as the day progressed.
