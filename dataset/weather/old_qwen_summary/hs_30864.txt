Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a brief spike and another decline, signaling possible atmospheric instability and the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors—rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and strengthening winds—indicate a developing weather pattern that could lead to elevated chances of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
