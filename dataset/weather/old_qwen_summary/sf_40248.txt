Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early hours, remaining near saturation through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the night and early morning, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a shifting weather front. Wind speeds were elevated during the overnight and early morning periods, with strong gusts from the west to northwest, consistent with prevailing coastal wind patterns bringing in cooler marine air. The shift in wind direction from west-southwest to west and then to northwesterly suggests a change in atmospheric flow, potentially foreshadowing a shift in weather conditions, including the possibility of increasing instability later in the day.
