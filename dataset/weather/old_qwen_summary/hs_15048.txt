Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily declining, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely due to stable air and reduced mixing. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase in the early morning, stabilizing at high values before a sudden drop in the late evening, which may signal the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a consistent directional shift from southerly to westerly to easterly, implying a reorganization of local wind patterns possibly linked to a developing pressure gradient. These combined indicators suggest a complex interplay of nocturnal cooling, moisture buildup, and shifting air masses, potentially increasing the risk of foggy conditions overnight and setting the stage for unstable weather later in the day.
