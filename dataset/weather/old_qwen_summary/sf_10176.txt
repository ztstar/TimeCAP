Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler feel despite minimal temperature changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has been maintaining calm and stable conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low, with near-zero values at one point, indicating a lack of strong atmospheric motion, which can trap moisture and pollutants near the surface. The wind direction shifted unexpectedly during the evening and early morning, possibly signaling a brief change in airflow patterns, though it quickly reverted, reinforcing the stability of the current weather regime.
