Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly in the early morning and late night, indicating a moist air mass that contributed to a muggy feel and potential for localized condensation. Air pressure showed a significant spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a steady decline, suggesting the influence of a passing weather system that may have brought temporary stability before weakening. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly directions, which may indicate a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors suggest the onset of a developing weather event, possibly associated with a low-pressure system that could lead to thunderstorms or scattered showers later in the day.
