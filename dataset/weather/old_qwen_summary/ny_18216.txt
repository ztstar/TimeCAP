Temperatures declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped sharply as temperatures began to rise, suggesting a transition from a damp, cool period to a drier, warmer phase. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend through the evening and overnight, with a notable drop in the late night hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. These indicators collectively suggest a developing frontal system that could lead to precipitation and stronger winds later in the day.
