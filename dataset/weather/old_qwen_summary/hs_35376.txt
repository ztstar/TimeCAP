Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly as temperatures increased and the air became drier. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved conditions. Wind speeds were low and variable during the overnight period, increasing steadily in the afternoon, with winds shifting from the southeast to the south-southwest, consistent with a strengthening surface high. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms but potentially increasing heat retention during the day.
