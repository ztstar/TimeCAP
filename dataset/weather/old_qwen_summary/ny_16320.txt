Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early hours, suggesting a high likelihood of condensation or fog formation, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, indicating the influence of a low-pressure system that likely brought moisture and unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night, particularly in the early hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then westerly, consistent with the passage of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition from humid, potentially stormy conditions to clearer, cooler air later in the day, with a possible return of breezy conditions in the evening.
