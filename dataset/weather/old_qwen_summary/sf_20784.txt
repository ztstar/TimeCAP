Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining through the day, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the period, particularly in the late night and early morning, signaling a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with minimal variation, while wind direction shifted from northeasterly to more southeasterly, indicating a subtle change in local wind flow possibly linked to thermal or synoptic influences. These conditions collectively suggest a stable but evolving marine layer, with potential for foggy or overcast conditions in the morning hours and a gradual clearing trend later in the day.
