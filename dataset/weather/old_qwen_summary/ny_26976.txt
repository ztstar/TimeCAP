Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the day, indicating a cold night with a warming trend as daylight returned. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and poor visibility during those hours. A sustained rise in air pressure throughout the night and into the morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, associated with stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly in the early hours, with calm conditions prevailing during the coldest part of the night, then increasing slightly in the afternoon as winds shifted direction from the north to the southwest. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, combined with rising temperatures and falling humidity, signals the potential for improving weather conditions and a transition toward milder, more stable air.
