Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the early morning hours before gradually warming slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a gradual decline, indicating a period of saturated air and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the day, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no significant weather systems passing through. Wind speeds were generally light but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south-southeast, which may indicate a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a persistent marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely contributing to foggy mornings and mild daytime temperatures.
