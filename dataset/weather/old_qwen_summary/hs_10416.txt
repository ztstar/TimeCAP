Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels were initially high, peaking in the early hours, but declined sharply through the morning, indicating a drying trend consistent with the onset of a more stable air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the mid-to-late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds showed moderate variability, with the strongest gusts occurring in the morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that indicate changing airflow patterns. These combined indicators point to a transition from a moist, unstable night into a drier, more settled daytime regime, likely driven by the arrival of a high-pressure ridge that may persist into the coming days.
