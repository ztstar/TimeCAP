Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting a transition from marine layer conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, reaching a peak before declining in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds intensified during the late morning and early evening, with a notable shift in direction from offshore to onshore winds, potentially bringing in maritime air. These combined trends point to a strong influence of the Pacific Ocean on local weather, with the potential for fog or low clouds in the early hours and improved visibility later in the day.
