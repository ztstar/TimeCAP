Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before stabilizing, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation likely associated with a low-pressure system. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point before beginning a slight recovery, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly during the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns suggest that New York City experienced the influence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing overcast skies and a higher likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
