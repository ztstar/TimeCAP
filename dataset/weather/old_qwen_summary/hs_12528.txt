Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating a buildup of daytime heating. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate later in the day. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating the onset of a change in air flow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable morning to a more variable afternoon and evening, with the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
