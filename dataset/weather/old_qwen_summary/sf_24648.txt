Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A sharp drop in air pressure in the late afternoon signaled the approach of a low-pressure system, likely contributing to shifting wind patterns and increased cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more southerly and easterly later in the day may indicate the influence of a developing weather pattern that could bring continued variability or potential precipitation.
