Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the morning, weakened briefly in the midday, then intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, consistent with onshore flow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier, and breezier weather, typical of a clearing coastal front.
