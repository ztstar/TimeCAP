Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to potential afternoon convective activity. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual upward trend in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings fair weather. Wind patterns shifted from northeasterly to southeasterly and then to a more southerly direction, potentially transporting warm, moist air into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, elevated humidity, and changing wind direction suggests a growing potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, particularly during the afternoon hours.
