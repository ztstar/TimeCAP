Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling trend likely tied to cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of a moist boundary layer, which may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a marked increase in the afternoon and evening, peaking during the late night, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and nighttime hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly, indicating a change in large-scale flow. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more unstable daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for thunderstorm development later in the day.
