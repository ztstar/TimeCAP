Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping during midday, suggesting a transition from cooler, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the early morning, stabilized, and then began a gradual decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate during the early hours, dropped to minimal levels in the midday, and then increased again in the evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest that a cold front may have passed through, leading to clearing skies and a potential for improving conditions later in the day.
