Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and rising solar insolation. Humidity levels surged significantly in the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, followed by a sharp increase mid-morning, signaling the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a weakening low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to variable, with a brief surge from the west and south, consistent with changing synoptic conditions that may support convective activity. These combined factors—high moisture, temperature rebound, and pressure changes—create an environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, especially as surface heating intensifies.
