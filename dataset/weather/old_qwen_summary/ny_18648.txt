Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a persistent cold front moving through the region, with the coldest readings observed in the early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting high and stable, then dropping sharply during midday before rising again late in the period—suggesting a mix of dry and moist air masses. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, culminating in a high-pressure system that has likely brought clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with peak gusts from the southwest, indicating strong atmospheric instability and potential for gusty conditions. The combination of dropping temperatures, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition to colder, drier, and more stable weather, which may lead to frost risks overnight and improved visibility.
