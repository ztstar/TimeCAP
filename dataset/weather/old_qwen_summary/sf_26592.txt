Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which dissipated somewhat during the afternoon but remained elevated in the late evening. Air pressure showed a notable dip around midday, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure trough or frontal boundary, which may have contributed to the changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and overnight, with gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with onshore breezes that often occur during coastal fog events. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore patterns supports the arrival of a marine influence, reinforcing the likelihood of continued fog and cool temperatures in the near term.
