Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night before beginning to stabilize in the early morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before easing slightly in the late afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, followed by a gradual decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly and then to easterly indicates a change in airflow, likely associated with a developing coastal influence or approaching weather pattern.
