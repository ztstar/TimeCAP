Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar heating and possibly a buildup of warm air near the surface. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and midday hours, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to a stagnant air mass, which may contribute to discomfort and potential for afternoon thunderstorms. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the evening, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in the late hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, indicating a change in airflow patterns possibly associated with a passing frontal boundary. Overall, the combination of warming temperatures, high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more stable but still humid conditions, with a moderate risk of isolated thunderstorms if sufficient lift develops.
