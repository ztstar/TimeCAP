Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a passing cold front. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and improving weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow during the night and early morning, shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon. The combination of drying air, rising pressure, and steady winds points to a transition toward more stable and pleasant conditions by late evening.
