Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with a sharp drop during early morning hours followed by a rebound in the late afternoon, suggesting possible dry air advection in the morning and moisture influx later. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but experienced a notable drop in the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west to northwest, possibly indicating a developing boundary or frontal influence. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with cooling overnight, shifting moisture, and increasing wind activity potentially leading to changing conditions in the coming hours.
