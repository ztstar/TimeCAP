Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of winter conditions. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the early and mid-night hours but increased significantly in the late evening and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation or a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, peaking in the early afternoon and remaining high, which typically signals the influence of a strong high-pressure system bringing stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low and steady, with a notable reduction in the afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted from west-southwest to southwest, aligning with the movement of the high-pressure system. Overall, the data suggests a cold, stable, and dry weather pattern, with minimal chance of precipitation and limited atmospheric instability across New York City.
