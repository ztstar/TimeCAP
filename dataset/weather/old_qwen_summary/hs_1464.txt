Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warmer, more dynamic phase. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or low visibility, before plummeting during midday, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a marked decline in the late afternoon, coinciding with the temperature surge, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. Together, these trends suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day, driven by warm, moist air interacting with a frontal boundary.
