Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming slightly in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively low, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry and stable conditions, though they increased slightly in the afternoon. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then began a gradual decrease, indicating the possible approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate overnight, with a notable reduction in the mid-morning hours, followed by a resurgence in the evening, particularly from the northwest and west-southwest sectors. The combination of decreasing pressure, shifting wind patterns, and increasing afternoon humidity suggests a developing weather change, potentially leading to cloudier skies or precipitation later in the day.
