Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a sharp temperature rebound, indicating the passage of a weather front. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air masses likely associated with a developing storm system. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then to a strong southerly flow, with gusts increasing significantly, reinforcing the potential for thunderstorms. These combined factors point to an active weather pattern with a high likelihood of rain and unstable conditions in the near term.
