Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight rise toward the late afternoon, suggesting the potential approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were subdued through the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from predominantly southwest to west-southwest, consistent with coastal flow patterns. These conditions point to a typical marine-influenced climate pattern, with foggy mornings, moderate temperatures, and stable atmospheric conditions likely persisting into the near term.
