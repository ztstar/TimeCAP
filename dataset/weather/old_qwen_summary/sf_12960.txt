Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping slightly during the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or reduced moisture influx. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing in the afternoon, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, consistent with changing pressure gradients and possible onshore flow. These combined patterns suggest the influence of a coastal weather system, potentially bringing cooler, moister conditions and increased wind activity to the region.
