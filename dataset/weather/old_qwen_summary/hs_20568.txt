Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before steadily decreasing, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass with some drying in the afternoon. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the midday and early evening, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from northerly and westerly in the early morning to more easterly and southerly in the late afternoon, implying a change in local circulation. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for increasing instability and the possibility of thunderstorms later in the day.
