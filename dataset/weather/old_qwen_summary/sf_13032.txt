Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through midday, indicating the presence of moist air likely associated with marine influence. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds were initially strong and consistent from the southwest, shifting to more variable patterns later in the day, with a notable increase in the evening from the west and northwest, potentially indicating changing synoptic conditions. These combined trends point to a developing coastal weather pattern, likely bringing overcast skies and the potential for light drizzle or fog, especially during the morning hours.
