Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking and remaining high through the night before declining during the late morning, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. These combined factors suggest that Houston is currently under the influence of a stable high-pressure system with a moderate risk of fog or low clouds overnight, but improving conditions are expected as the pressure continues to rise and winds moderate.
