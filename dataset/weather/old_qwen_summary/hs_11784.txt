Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours, before dropping sharply in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, culminating in a significant rise during the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with sustained strong winds from the north and northeast, likely contributing to the cooling and drying trends. These conditions point to the arrival of a stable high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and cooler temperatures, signaling a shift toward more settled weather in the region.
