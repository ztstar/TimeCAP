Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion typical of coastal fog formation. A consistent drop in wind speed during the early hours, followed by a resurgence in the evening, suggests a shift in local wind patterns, likely tied to the development and dissipation of a coastal inversion layer. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and into the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may lead to clearer skies and drier conditions in the coming hours. Combined with the wind direction transitioning from southwest to more variable, these factors point toward a transition from foggy, moist conditions to potentially more stable, sunny weather as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
