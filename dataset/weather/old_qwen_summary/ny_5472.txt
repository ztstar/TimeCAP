Over the past 24 hours, a marked shift in atmospheric conditions occurred, beginning with stable temperatures and low humidity, followed by a significant drop in temperature and a sharp increase in humidity during the early morning hours. This transition coincided with a steady rise in air pressure, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the northwest and western sectors, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal boundary or localized circulation. The wind direction variability, particularly the shift toward more southerly and easterly flows later in the period, hints at the potential for moisture advection and possible changes in cloud cover or precipitation timing. Overall, the data reflects a transition from dry, cool conditions to a more humid and dynamically active environment, with implications for visibility, comfort, and the likelihood of late-night or early-morning precipitation.
