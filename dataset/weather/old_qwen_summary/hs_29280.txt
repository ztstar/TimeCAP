Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture availability, likely due to nighttime condensation and reduced evaporation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northeast and east sectors, suggesting a shift in circulation patterns. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and stronger winds from the east may indicate the onset of a more humid and potentially unsettled period, possibly setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
