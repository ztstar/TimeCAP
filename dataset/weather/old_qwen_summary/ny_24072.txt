Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising again during the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable spike in the mid-afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction, including a transition from westerly to southerly and later northeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined conditions suggest a transition from a cooler, moist, and stable nighttime environment to a gradually warming and potentially clearer daytime scenario, with minimal risk of precipitation.
