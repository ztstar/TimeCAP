Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping significantly overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels showed a pronounced rise during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, beginning with light northerly and westerly flows, then turning to more easterly and southerly directions in the late evening, which may have facilitated moisture transport and influenced local convection. These combined trends suggest the onset of a drier, more stable air mass, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms but potentially increasing discomfort during daytime hours due to residual humidity and elevated temperatures.
