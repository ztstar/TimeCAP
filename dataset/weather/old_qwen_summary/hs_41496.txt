Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and warmer conditions. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the midday, which may have contributed to the perception of mugginess followed by a drier, more comfortable feel. Air pressure decreased steadily throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting an approaching weather system that could bring changes such as precipitation or wind shifts. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southeast and east, consistent with a developing low-pressure influence. Combined, these indicators suggest a dynamic atmospheric transition, potentially setting the stage for unstable weather later in the day or overnight.
