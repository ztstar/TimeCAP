Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp rise in temperatures in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked at 100% during the early morning hours, indicating saturated conditions likely leading to fog or mist, which gradually diminished as temperatures climbed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which was followed by a rebound in pressure later in the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more variable patterns, indicating changing airflow dynamics associated with the passing weather system. These conditions suggest a transition from humid, stable nighttime air to warmer, drier, and more variable daytime weather, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
