Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a marked temperature minimum around dawn. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly between midnight and 6 AM. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night, increasing slightly in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly associated with the advancing high pressure. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather in the coming hours, reducing the likelihood of precipitation.
