Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a steady increase overnight, reaching a peak before a gradual decline in the late evening, signaling a possible weakening of a high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly associated with a developing low-pressure influence. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind speeds raises the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, especially with continued daytime heating.
