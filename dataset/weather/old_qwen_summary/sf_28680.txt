Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with prolonged periods of high humidity and brief spikes to saturation, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting frequent fog formation and condensation. Air pressure exhibited a marked rise in the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning before a steady decline, which may signal the approach of a weather system shift. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, driven by strong southerly and westerly flows, contributing to the mixing of the marine layer and eventual fog dissipation. The combination of fluctuating wind directions and pressure changes points to a complex interaction between coastal airflow and a developing atmospheric disturbance, which could lead to unstable or transitional weather conditions in the coming hours.
