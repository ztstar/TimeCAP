Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating strong potential for fog formation and poor visibility. A consistent drop in air pressure, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggests an approaching weather system, possibly associated with marine layer development or an incursion of moist air from the Pacific. Wind speeds increased slightly in the afternoon and remained elevated, with winds shifting toward more southeasterly directions, reinforcing the influx of coastal air. These conditions collectively point to a prolonged marine layer event, likely resulting in cool, damp, and foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas of the city.
