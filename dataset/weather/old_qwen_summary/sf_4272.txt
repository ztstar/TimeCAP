Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the night and early morning, indicating dense fog formation, which gradually cleared as temperatures rose and wind patterns shifted. A significant rise in air pressure occurred in the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing of fog and stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, driven by a shift toward more variable wind directions, including strong southerly and westerly components. These changes suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and calm coastal environment to a drier, clearer, and slightly breezier atmosphere, consistent with typical afternoon conditions in the Bay Area.
