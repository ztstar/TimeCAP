Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region's microclimate. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting condensation and potential fog formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a cooler feel. A notable pressure rise in the late night and early morning hours was followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from moderate southerly and westerly flows during the night to a significant easterly component in the evening, potentially influencing coastal upwelling and fog movement. Combined, these dynamics point to a transition from stable, foggy conditions to a more dynamic and potentially storm-prone environment later in the day.
