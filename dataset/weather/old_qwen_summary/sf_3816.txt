Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or low cloud cover typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed multiple strong increases, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the passage of high-pressure systems that can bring stable, dry conditions but also enhance temperature inversions. Wind speeds were notably high during the early and late night hours, with prevailing westerly and southwesterly winds that helped transport marine air inland, while a dramatic shift to easterly and northeasterly winds in the late morning indicates a change in synoptic-scale flow. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing wind speeds, and a shift in wind direction points to a potential clearing trend, signaling improving conditions for the coming day.
