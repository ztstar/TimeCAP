Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning, peaking in the overnight hours before gradually declining, suggesting a possible shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief drop in the middle of the day followed by a recovery, which may reflect the passage of a weak weather system. Wind speeds decreased slightly over time, and the wind direction consistently shifted from southerly to more southeasterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transitioning weather regime, with warming temperatures and decreasing moisture potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
