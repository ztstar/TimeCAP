Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the onset of fog or dew formation, potentially impacting visibility. Air pressure exhibited a significant rise in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained variable, with a notable increase in the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northeasterly to easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a moist, cooler overnight period into a more stable, potentially clearer daytime regime under the influence of a developing high-pressure ridge.
