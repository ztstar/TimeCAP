- Humidity (%): Humidity levels remained relatively stable in the early hours before a noticeable increase in the mid-to-late night, peaking dramatically toward the final hours of the period. The rapid ascent from moderate to near-saturated conditions suggests a significant influx of moist air, likely associated with changing weather patterns or precipitation onset. This trend implies growing discomfort for residents and potential implications for air quality and localized weather phenomena such as fog or thunderstorms.
- Air Pressure (hPa): The air pressure has exhibited a steady upward trend over the past 24 hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. A prolonged period of sustained pressure values followed by a gradual decline suggests a possible transition phase, with the system beginning to weaken or become less dominant. This pattern may signal changing weather conditions, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation if the pressure continues to drop.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline during the initial phase, followed by a pronounced increase through the mid-to-late period, indicating a significant warming trend that peaked before reversing. The subsequent cooling phase suggests a stabilization or potential recovery toward earlier conditions, with minor fluctuations indicating atmospheric adjustment. The overall pattern reflects a diurnal cycle or influence from external weather systems, with implications for local climate dynamics and energy demand.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speeds remained consistently low during the initial phase, with multiple periods of calm conditions, suggesting a temporary lull in atmospheric activity. A gradual increase in wind intensity followed, peaking in the latter half of the period, indicating the onset of stronger air movement, possibly due to shifting pressure systems. The sustained higher speeds toward the end may signal evolving weather conditions, potentially preceding a change in local weather, such as an approaching front or storm system.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a shift from predominantly westerly and southwestern origins to a consistent trend toward the northeast and eastern quadrants, indicating a possible change in large-scale airflow patterns. A notable period of sustained wind from the north and east, particularly in the latter half of the observation window, suggests the influence of an approaching or developing weather system. The abrupt transition from southwesterly to easterly winds may signal a frontal passage, with potential implications for changing weather conditions such as temperature drops or precipitation.
