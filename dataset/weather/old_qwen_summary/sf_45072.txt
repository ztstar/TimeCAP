The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has been exceptionally stable, with no significant changes in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent conditions suggest a persistent high-pressure system is dominating the region, leading to clear skies and minimal atmospheric disturbance. The low humidity levels indicate dry air, which may increase fire risk in surrounding vegetation, particularly during daylight hours. The steady wind from the southeast has maintained a gentle but unvarying flow, contributing to the lack of weather variability. Overall, the prolonged stability points to a prolonged period of dry, mild conditions with little potential for precipitation or storms.
