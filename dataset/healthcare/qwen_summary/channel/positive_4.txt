- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in the number of specimens tested, suggesting increasing respiratory activity or heightened surveillance. A notable acceleration in the rate of increase is observed in the final eight weeks, indicating a possible surge in influenza circulation. The peak in the most recent weeks, followed by a slight decline, may reflect the peak of the seasonal outbreak or potential saturation in testing demand, warranting continued monitoring for signs of sustained transmission.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The data reveals a steep and sustained upward trajectory in influenza A positivity, with a dramatic acceleration starting in the 13th week, indicating a significant surge in respiratory transmission. The peak occurred in the 19th week, followed by a notable decline in the most recent week, suggesting the possibility of a turning point or the onset of a post-peak decrease. This pattern implies a sharp epidemic wave likely driven by high community transmission, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the need for targeted public health interventions.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and sharp upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the latter half of the period, suggesting a significant surge in influenza B activity. The most pronounced increase occurred between week 15 and week 19, followed by a slight decline in the final week, which may indicate the onset of a peak or early plateau in the outbreak. This pattern implies growing community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting heightened surveillance and preparedness efforts.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp increase in the latter half of the period, indicating a significant surge in influenza activity. The peak was observed in the 18th week, followed by a notable decline, suggesting the possible onset of a post-peak phase or waning of the current outbreak. This pattern implies a seasonal influenza wave with rising transmission intensity, necessitating heightened surveillance, resource allocation, and public health preparedness to mitigate potential impacts on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable shift from low baseline levels to significantly elevated positivity rates, particularly in the final months. The peak occurred in the 18th week, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting a possible waning of the current influenza wave. This pattern indicates a strong seasonal surge with a likely culmination and potential early signs of resolution, warranting continued surveillance to monitor for resurgence or emergence of new strains.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final seven weeks, suggesting a significant and growing influenza B circulation. A sharp inflection point occurs in the middle of the series, transitioning from low-to-moderate levels to a rapid increase, which may indicate the onset of a seasonal peak or an emerging outbreak. The sustained high levels in the most recent weeks, followed by a slight decline, imply that the epidemic may be nearing its peak or beginning to plateau, warranting heightened surveillance and preparedness for healthcare systems.
