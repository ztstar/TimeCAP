Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dipping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air likely associated with a marine layer. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought gusty winds and shifting conditions. Wind speeds decreased through the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and eventually easterly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics and possible fog formation. These patterns point to a dynamic coastal weather regime typical of San Francisco, where maritime influences and topography combine to produce rapid and localized changes in temperature, humidity, and wind.
