Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and a damp, muggy feel in the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around the early morning, suggesting the approach or passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased through the night and into the morning, shifting from southerly to easterly and later to a more southerly-southeasterly direction, consistent with a developing circulation pattern. The combination of high moisture, decreasing pressure, and strengthening winds points to a heightened potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if daytime heating intensifies.
