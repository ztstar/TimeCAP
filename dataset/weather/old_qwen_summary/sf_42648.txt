Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the early morning hours before stabilizing. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor variations suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, consistent with a calm or slowly evolving weather pattern. Wind speeds were generally low, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from the southwest and west to more variable directions, possibly due to local topography and sea-breeze influences. These conditions point to a period of maritime influence, with coastal fog and mild temperatures typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly during transitional periods between day and night.
