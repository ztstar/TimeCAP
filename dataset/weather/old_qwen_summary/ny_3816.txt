Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a sharp drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise, indicating a cold night with a gradual warming trend into the afternoon. Humidity levels were consistently low during the early hours, surged significantly during the overnight period, and then fluctuated, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible moisture influx. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early hours, particularly during the overnight period, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cold, dry, and windy night under a high-pressure influence to a warming, potentially more humid afternoon, with implications for comfort and possible early signs of a weather change later in the day.
