Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point before rising sharply in the late morning and afternoon, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the evening and overnight, with sustained strong gusts from the northwest to west, consistent with a cold front passage and potential for turbulent conditions. The combination of falling temperatures, shifting wind directions, and rising pressure points to a transition from mild, humid conditions to cooler, drier, and more stable weather, likely resulting in clear skies and crisp air in the coming hours.
