Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. A significant increase in humidity occurred during the night and early morning, peaking just before sunrise, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, likely signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass, which may lead to improved visibility and more comfortable daytime conditions in the coming hours.
