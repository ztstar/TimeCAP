Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the night, with near-calms observed, but picked up again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southeasterly, suggesting a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day.
