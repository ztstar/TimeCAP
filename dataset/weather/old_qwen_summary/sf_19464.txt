Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which suggests prolonged moisture presence and potential for fog formation, especially during the overnight hours. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, particularly in the early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may contribute to unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable reduction to near calm conditions during the early morning, while wind direction shifted from northwest to west-southwest, consistent with a coastal influence and possible onshore flow. These combined factors point to a maritime climate pattern typical of San Francisco, with a high likelihood of fog and overcast conditions, especially during the early morning hours.
