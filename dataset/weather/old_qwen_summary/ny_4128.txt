Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the day, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and cooling at night. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, beginning low, spiking mid-morning, then dropping sharply in the afternoon before rising again, suggesting a possible air mass change or localized precipitation event. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic decline during the early hours, followed by a sustained increase, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system and the subsequent arrival of a high-pressure ridge. Wind patterns revealed strong, consistent southerly to westerly flow in the morning and late afternoon, with gusts linked to the approaching high-pressure system, contributing to drying conditions. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, dry, and unstable air mass to a warmer, drier, and more stable environment, likely bringing clearer skies and improved conditions for the remainder of the day.
