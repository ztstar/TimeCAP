Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting increasing moisture availability, which may contribute to fog or dew formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-morning, followed by a recovery later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather system—likely a frontal boundary—that brought changing conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow early on, shifting to a more southerly direction in the afternoon, which may have facilitated moist air advection. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime period to a warmer, potentially unstable daytime regime, with conditions favorable for afternoon convective development.
