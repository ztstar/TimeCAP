Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rebound, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking before a rapid decline, suggesting the clearing of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding sharply, which is characteristic of a passing storm system. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, particularly from the south and southwest, aligning with the movement of a low-pressure system, and maintained strong gusts through the midday. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly indicates a change in dominant air flow, likely signaling the end of the stormy conditions and a transition toward drier, cooler weather.
