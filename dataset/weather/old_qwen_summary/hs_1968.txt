Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating increased moisture availability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, consistent with inflow ahead of a developing weather disturbance. These combined indicators point to a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with increased chances of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
