Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cool, stable conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation or low-level cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable pressure drop in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to southeast, points to the influence of a passing weather system, possibly bringing changing conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south, suggesting strong onshore flow that could enhance coastal fog or precipitation chances. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates a period of dynamic weather, with potential for fog, drizzle, or light rain in the coming hours.
