Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, with temperatures declining through the early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a gradual decline, indicating a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high through the night and early morning, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential approach of a weakening weather system. Wind speeds were generally low and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly by midday, consistent with a change in local circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition period, possibly marking the dissipation of a nocturnal cooling event and the beginning of a more stable, warmer afternoon, with reduced risk of precipitation.
