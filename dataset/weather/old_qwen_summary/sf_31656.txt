Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before stabilizing in the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the early morning, suggesting possible fog formation followed by dissipation. Air pressure remained consistently high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions with no immediate signs of storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, which likely contributed to the cooling and fog dissipation. The persistent wind direction from the west to northwest suggests a strong coastal influence, consistent with the region’s typical marine layer dynamics.
