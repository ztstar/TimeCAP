Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked variability, peaking during the early morning hours and subsequently dropping sharply, indicating a transition from damp to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind activity was generally light to moderate, with a shift from southerly to northerly and westerly flows, suggesting changing synoptic conditions and possible boundary layer adjustments. Overall, the data point to a stabilizing atmosphere with improving conditions, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms and favoring a clear to partly cloudy forecast for the immediate future.
