Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting possible fog or mist formation, which diminished significantly as temperatures rose and air pressure stabilized. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, indicating the passage of a weather front. The wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics that may signal an approaching system. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, which could influence visibility and comfort levels in the coming hours.
