Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moist air, likely associated with a stable boundary layer or low-level moisture accumulation. A steady decline in atmospheric pressure, particularly in the latter half of the period, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and northerly directions, accompanied by increasing speeds, especially in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a transition in air mass flow. These combined trends suggest that New York City is experiencing the influence of a developing weather system, potentially leading to precipitation or changing conditions in the near future.
