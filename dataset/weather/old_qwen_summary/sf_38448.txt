Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable shift in atmospheric conditions, beginning with persistently high humidity and cool temperatures, indicating a stable marine layer. A gradual increase in air pressure suggests the influence of a developing high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the early morning hours, followed by a marked intensification late in the period, coinciding with a change in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then toward the south-southeast. This shift in wind patterns may signal the arrival of a new air mass, potentially bringing increased cloud cover or fog. The combination of rising pressure, variable wind, and fluctuating humidity implies a transition in local weather dynamics, with a potential for changing conditions in the near term.
