Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or low clouds, reducing visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating a lack of strong weather systems moving through the region. Wind speeds remained low until the last few hours, when they increased slightly, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, suggesting a possible change in air mass or coastal influence. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures at night, and persistent low-level winds points to a strong likelihood of fog persistence into the early morning hours.
