Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high for much of the period, with multiple episodes of saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air masses conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, reflecting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northerly to southerly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to an active weather pattern that could lead to scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
