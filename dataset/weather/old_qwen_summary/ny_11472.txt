Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising toward midday. Humidity levels showed a cyclical pattern, alternating between high and low values, indicating repeated shifts in air mass, possibly linked to passing fronts or localized air mixing. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a notable spike in the final hour, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more variable, possibly signaling a change in atmospheric dynamics. These combined signals suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with potential for improved visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the near term.
