Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced consistently high humidity levels, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Temperatures remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, then showed a gradual increase in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the onset of diurnal warming. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the latter half, signaling a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the early morning hours, followed by a return to moderate levels later, with wind direction shifting from northeasterly to more southerly and finally westerly, indicating a change in air flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition period, possibly leading to clearer skies or the arrival of marine layer activity, which is typical in the region’s coastal climate.
