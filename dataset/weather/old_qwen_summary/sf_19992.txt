Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then easterly, implying changing synoptic conditions. These combined factors suggest the onset of a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially bringing overcast skies, light precipitation, or foggy conditions in the near term.
