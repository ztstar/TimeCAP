Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has likely stabilized the local weather. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly around dawn, which may signal a change in air mass or the onset of a local circulation pattern. These conditions together point to a transitioning atmosphere, with increasing stability and decreasing moisture, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
