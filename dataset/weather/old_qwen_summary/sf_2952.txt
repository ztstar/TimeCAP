Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the same overnight period, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in atmospheric pressure occurred around midday, with a sharp increase followed by a gradual decline, indicating the passage of a weather front that may have brought temporary stabilization. Wind patterns showed a transition from light, variable winds to more consistent easterly and southerly flows in the afternoon, possibly enhancing onshore airflow. Combined, these conditions suggest a dynamic coastal weather system influenced by marine layer development and shifting pressure gradients, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
