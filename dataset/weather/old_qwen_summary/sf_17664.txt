Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the overnight hours and sustaining near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained stable through much of the day before a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling potential stabilization or a weakening of marine influences. Wind speed was nearly uniform throughout most of the period, with a minor uptick in the final hour, while wind direction shifted progressively from southwest to west-southwest, indicating consistent onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. These conditions suggest a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, supporting cool, foggy mornings and relatively stable, damp weather patterns.
