Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during midday, followed by a gradual decline in the late evening, indicating a warming trend during daylight hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, peaking at near-saturation levels before dropping sharply in the late evening, suggesting possible clearing or a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, reaching a minimum during the early morning hours, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system and potential storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and eventually westerly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined indicators suggest an elevated risk of thunderstorms and unstable weather conditions, particularly during the overnight hours, with potential for heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
