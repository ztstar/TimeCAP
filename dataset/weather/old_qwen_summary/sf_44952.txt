Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent maritime influence, likely driven by the prevailing onshore flow typical of the region’s coastal climate. The unchanging low humidity levels indicate dry air, which, combined with stable temperatures, points to a lack of cloud development and minimal chance of precipitation. The steady air pressure and wind speed further reinforce the presence of a stable high-pressure system, contributing to clear skies and calm conditions. Overall, the current weather pattern reflects a prolonged period of dry, stable, and mild conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the summer months.
