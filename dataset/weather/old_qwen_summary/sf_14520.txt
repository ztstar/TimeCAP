Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated sharply, reaching peak moisture during early morning hours before declining through the day, followed by a sudden spike in the late evening, indicating possible fog formation or a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady rise through much of the day, peaking in the afternoon before a brief drop, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system with potential for changing conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, especially from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the cooling and moisture transport. These combined factors point to a transition in weather patterns, possibly signaling the arrival of coastal fog and a shift toward more variable, breezy conditions.
