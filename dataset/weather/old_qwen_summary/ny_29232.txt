Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant temperature drop during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure steadily increased, culminating in a high-pressure system that has since stabilized, suggesting improving and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast during the early morning, signaling a change in airflow associated with the front. The combination of these factors points to the recent passage of a cold front, now giving way to clearer skies and more stable, cooler conditions.
