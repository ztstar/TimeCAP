Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cold front passage during the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the early period, suggesting moist air influx, which later dropped significantly, consistent with the transition to drier conditions after the front moved through. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, reaching a peak before slightly declining, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that has stabilized the weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late afternoon, with shifting directions indicating dynamic airflow, particularly from the northwest and west, which aligns with the cold front movement. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a cold, moist, and windy period to a cooler, drier, and more stable atmosphere, likely resulting in clear skies and crisp conditions in the present.
