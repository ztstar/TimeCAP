Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing or shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, particularly during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, then decreased through midday before increasing again in the evening, with wind direction shifting from westerly to more southerly and then back to westerly, pointing to changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and breezy period to a drier, calmer, and more stable environment, typical of late autumn conditions in the region.
