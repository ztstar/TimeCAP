Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with sustained high values during the early morning hours, indicating potential fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure in the late evening and early morning suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and damp conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling possible changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing cooler, more humid conditions with a higher chance of fog or light drizzle in the near term.
