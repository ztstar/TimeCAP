Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. A sharp increase in humidity during the late night and early morning suggests the onset of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but saw a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a brief spike, indicating possible shifting weather systems. Wind patterns shifted from northwest to more southerly and easterly directions in the afternoon, accompanied by a significant increase in wind speed, likely due to a local breeze or frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a marine layer and potential for foggy conditions, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas, which may impact visibility and morning commutes.
