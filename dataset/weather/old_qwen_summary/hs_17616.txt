Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing at high levels, indicating a persistent moisture-rich environment conducive to potential thunderstorm development. Air pressure remained largely stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a relatively stagnant atmospheric regime with no strong frontal systems passing through. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that likely contributed to the transport of moist air into the region. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and stable pressure conditions increases the likelihood of afternoon or evening convective activity, particularly if instability develops later in the day.
