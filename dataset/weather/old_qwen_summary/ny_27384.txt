Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage during the night. Humidity levels showed a significant increase in the early hours, peaking during the night, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure rose sharply during the night and remained high through the morning, signaling the influence of a strong high-pressure system that has stabilized conditions. Wind speeds intensified overnight, particularly from the southeast, before decreasing and shifting to a more southerly direction by late morning, suggesting a change in wind patterns linked to the high-pressure influence. The combination of dropping temperatures, high humidity, and sustained high pressure has led to a crisp, clear day with a potential for early morning fog and cooler conditions throughout the day.
