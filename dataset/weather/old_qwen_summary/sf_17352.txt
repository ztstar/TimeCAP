Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a gradual decline during the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a slow recovery in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before gradually decreasing, indicating a period of condensation and fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more southerly and southeasterly, aligning with the movement of a coastal frontal boundary. These trends point to a transition from cool, foggy overnight conditions toward a clearer, more stable day, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather patterns.
