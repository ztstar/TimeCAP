Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly during the hours of lowest temperatures. A significant pressure drop occurred in the late night and early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable weather and precipitation. Wind speeds increased substantially during the same period, with strong gusts from a southerly to westerly direction, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near future, especially as the system continues to move through the region.
