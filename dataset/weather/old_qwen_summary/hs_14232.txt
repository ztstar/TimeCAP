Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping during the day, indicating a shift from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to drier, more variable conditions. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a sustained period of high pressure in the early morning hours, suggesting a temporary influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to the clear, stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and again in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from southerly to westerly directions, potentially signaling the arrival of a changing air mass. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a possible transition toward more unsettled weather, possibly including thunderstorm development later in the day.
