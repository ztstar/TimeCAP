Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping significantly and stabilizing at lower levels during early morning hours. A notable increase in humidity occurred during the same period, reaching near saturation levels, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. A sharp drop in air pressure around midday signaled the approach of a weather system, followed by a gradual rebound, indicating the passage of a frontal boundary. Wind activity intensified in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with marine layer dynamics and onshore flow. These combined factors suggest the presence of a persistent marine layer, with potential for foggy conditions and cool, damp weather into the coming hours.
