Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by maritime conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely formed during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure remained largely stable until the late evening, when a slight drop occurred, potentially signaling the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds were light and variable, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then back to the southwest, consistent with local coastal dynamics and possible sea breeze influences. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds implies a high likelihood of fog or drizzle, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which could affect visibility and commute conditions.
