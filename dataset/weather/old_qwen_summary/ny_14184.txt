Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, reflecting a diurnal pattern influenced by cloud cover and wind. Humidity remained consistently high, suggesting saturated air conditions that may contribute to fog or light precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, hinting at dynamic atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast in the final hours suggests a possible change in storm track, potentially leading to rain or showers later in the day.
