Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually increasing through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began to drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, which may signal the onset of a frontal passage. Combined with the wind direction shift from prevailing westerly to more northerly and easterly flows, these changes suggest a transition in weather patterns that could lead to cooler, potentially unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
