Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels exhibited extreme fluctuations, with prolonged periods of near-saturated air during the night and early morning, likely contributing to fog formation, followed by significant drying during the daytime. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a gradual decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system capable of bringing more dynamic weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, which may have helped disperse fog and mix the boundary layer. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a more variable and potentially unsettled atmosphere, consistent with typical coastal weather patterns in the region.
