Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity reached near saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or dense moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler feel despite minimal temperature variation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the final hours, signaling the potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring further changes. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief pause in the middle of the night, while wind direction shifted significantly, suggesting changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing weather front. These conditions point to a transition period, with possible foggy and cool conditions persisting into the coming hours, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
