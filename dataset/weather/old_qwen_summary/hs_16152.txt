Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, increased steadily in the afternoon, and remained elevated in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and back to northeast, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns suggest the potential for developing instability, particularly as warming continues and humidity fluctuates, which could lead to afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and lift are sufficient.
