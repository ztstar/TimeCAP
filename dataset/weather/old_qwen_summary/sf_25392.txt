Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply during midday, indicating a shift from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the night but dropped notably in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, likely contributing to coastal fog dissipation and enhanced mixing of air. The wind direction shifted from prevailing westerly to more variable, including southerly and northerly components, reflecting dynamic atmospheric changes that may signal the onset of a shift in weather patterns.
