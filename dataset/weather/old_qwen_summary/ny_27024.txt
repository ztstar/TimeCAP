Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating a period of saturated air, followed by a significant drop as conditions dried out during the afternoon. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase, particularly during midday, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and back, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the passing of a cold front. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cooler overnight period to a drier, more stable daytime environment, likely resulting in improving visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the near term.
