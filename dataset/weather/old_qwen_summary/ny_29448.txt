Temperature trends over the past 24 hours show a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a modest warming. Humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which later dropped sharply, likely due to clearing skies and increased mixing. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-afternoon before slightly declining, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and west, consistent with a developing surface pressure gradient. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition from a cold, damp overnight period to a gradually improving, breezy afternoon, with potential for clearing skies and a moderate wind chill lingering into the evening.
