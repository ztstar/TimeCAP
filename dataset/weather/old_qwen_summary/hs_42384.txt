Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant shift in atmospheric conditions, beginning with stable temperatures and high humidity, followed by a pronounced warming trend during the afternoon hours. A notable pressure increase occurred overnight, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced moisture levels in the latter half of the period. Humidity dropped sharply during midday, coinciding with a rise in wind speeds and a change in wind direction from easterly to more northerly and southerly patterns, suggesting a shift in air mass. The wind patterns exhibited variability, with brief gusts and directional shifts likely associated with localized convection or front passage. These changes signal a transition from a humid, potentially unstable environment to a drier, more stable air mass, which may suppress thunderstorm development in the near term.
