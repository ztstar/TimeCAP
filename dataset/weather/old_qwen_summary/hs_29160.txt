Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a marked drop in the early hours followed by a temporary rise and another sharp decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west, consistent with the influence of a developing or passing storm system. These conditions collectively point to an unstable atmosphere, increasing the potential for thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
