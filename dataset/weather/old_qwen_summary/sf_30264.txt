Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which likely contributed to fog formation, consistent with the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure rose notably during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight and into the early morning, with near-calm conditions around sunrise, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest. These patterns suggest a transition from a foggy, cool overnight period to a clearer, warmer daytime regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
