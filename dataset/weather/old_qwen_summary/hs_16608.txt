Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest during the night, then veering back toward the northeast in the late afternoon—indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These conditions point to the dissipation of a nocturnal boundary layer and the potential for afternoon convection as temperatures rise and moisture decreases, increasing the risk of scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
