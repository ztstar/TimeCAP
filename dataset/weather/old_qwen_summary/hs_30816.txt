Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improved conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, suggesting the passage of a boundary or the onset of a change in air mass. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, unstable night to a drier, more stable daytime environment, with the potential for fair weather in the immediate forecast.
