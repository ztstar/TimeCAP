Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-saturation humidity, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Temperatures remained consistently low, with a notable dip in the early morning hours, suggesting nocturnal cooling and possible marine layer development. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling a gradual shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions, potentially indicating the influence of a high-pressure system approaching from the west. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm, and wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly, consistent with a change in airflow pattern likely associated with the marine layer dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a lingering coastal fog event with limited air movement, contributing to cool, damp conditions across the city.
