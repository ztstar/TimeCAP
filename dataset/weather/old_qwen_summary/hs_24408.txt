Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, reaching saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist and increased discomfort during those hours. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions during the midday. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a shift toward more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late afternoon, accompanied by changes in wind direction suggesting a transition in air mass flow. These combined factors suggest a shift from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for improved air quality but also increased heat retention during the afternoon.
