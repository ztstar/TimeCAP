Over the past 24 hours, a sharp drop in temperature was observed, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by the arrival of a cold air mass. Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced increase during the late night and early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low clouds as moisture accumulated in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable decrease followed by a rapid rebound, signaling the passage of a weather front, possibly a low-pressure system that has since begun to move out. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong, variable winds from the northwest during the early morning, followed by a sudden change to southerly and easterly flows, which may have contributed to the influx of moist air. These conditions together point to a dynamic and transitional weather period, with the potential for unstable conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
