Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air possibly associated with a low-pressure system. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop in wind speed, signaling the approach or passage of a weather front. Wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to a more easterly flow, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These combined trends suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a cooler, humid, and stable environment to a potentially more variable and unsettled condition later in the day.
