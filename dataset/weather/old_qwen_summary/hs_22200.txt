Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily into the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potentially unstable air. Humidity levels showed a significant decline in the latter half of the period, suggesting drier air moving in, which may reduce the likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but showed a downward trend toward the end, hinting at approaching atmospheric instability that could support storm development. Wind speeds remained low for most of the day, with a notable increase in the final hours, and wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to easterly, indicating a possible change in air mass or frontal passage. Together, these patterns suggest a transition in Houston’s weather, with warming, drying air and shifting wind patterns potentially leading to a higher chance of thunderstorms later in the day.
