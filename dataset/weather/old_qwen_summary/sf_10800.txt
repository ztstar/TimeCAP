Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with multiple spikes indicating periods of fog or low-level moisture influx, particularly during the night and early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall but exhibited a notable drop toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of changing weather systems. Wind speeds were consistently low, with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted dramatically at multiple points, hinting at localized or transient atmospheric influences. These conditions collectively suggest a transition phase, possibly involving the dissipation of marine layer fog and the influence of shifting wind patterns, which may lead to clearer skies and more variable conditions in the coming hours.
