Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a low before gradually warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from cooler, moist air to drier, warmer conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the late morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from northerly to westerly and eventually southerly. Together, these indicators suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a gradually warming, drier, and more stable day, consistent with improving conditions under a strengthening high-pressure influence.
