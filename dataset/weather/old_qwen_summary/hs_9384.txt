Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the influence of increasing solar radiation and potential daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, declining steadily in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as surface temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight but steady increase, reflecting the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of convective activity, though residual moisture may still support isolated afternoon showers.
