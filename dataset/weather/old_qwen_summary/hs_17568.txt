Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, then declined significantly during midday, suggesting a drying trend as surface temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, reaching a peak around midday before slowly declining, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system or a developing low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a notable shift in direction from southerly to easterly and then more northerly, indicating changing wind patterns possibly tied to a frontal boundary or mesoscale circulation. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with decreasing humidity and increasing temperatures potentially leading to more comfortable conditions later in the day, though lingering moisture could still support isolated afternoon showers.
