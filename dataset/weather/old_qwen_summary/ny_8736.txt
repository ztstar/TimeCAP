Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the daytime, indicating the onset of a warming trend likely driven by shifting air masses. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which may have contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a recovery, suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, possibly bringing unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly directions, aligning with the movement of the pressure system and influencing temperature and moisture transport. These combined factors indicate that New York City experienced a transition from cooler, moist conditions to a more stable, warmer environment, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies later in the day.
