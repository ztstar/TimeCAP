Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, declining significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine influence to drier, warmer air. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, particularly during the morning and midday, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with brief bursts of moderate wind in the afternoon, primarily from the west and southwest, consistent with sea breeze patterns and coastal airflow. These trends collectively point to a clear, mild day with improving conditions and reduced fog likelihood as the evening progressed.
