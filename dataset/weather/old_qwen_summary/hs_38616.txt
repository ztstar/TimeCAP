Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, reaching saturation and contributing to a persistent foggy or overcast condition. A gradual rise in air pressure, particularly in the late afternoon, suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind patterns showed variability, with stronger gusts in the evening and a shift in direction toward the southwest, indicating possible changes in air mass movement. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, unstable nocturnal environment to a more stable and gradually warming atmosphere as the system evolves.
