Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to increased cloud cover and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reaching a peak in the late morning, which is typically associated with improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, driven by a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and easterly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. These patterns collectively point to a transition period, where cooler, moister air has moved in, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day.
