Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with typical coastal conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions after the overnight moisture buildup. Wind speeds remained low initially but increased noticeably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, suggesting a change in local airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and increasing pressure points to a likely transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, drier air as the day progresses.
