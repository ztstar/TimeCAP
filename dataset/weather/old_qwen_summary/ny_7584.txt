A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise toward midday, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have led to fog or mist formation. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic spike in the late morning, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may indicate the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a damp, cool night to a drier, more stable day, with the potential for improving visibility and fair skies later in the day.
