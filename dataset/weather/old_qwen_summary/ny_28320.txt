Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a gradual stabilization, indicating the transition from a cool, stable period into a more moderate morning. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the low visibility and cooler perceived temperatures. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the late morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning hours before subsiding, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly, implying a change in air mass and potential influence from a frontal boundary. Together, these trends point to a transitioning weather pattern, with improving conditions and a reduced chance of precipitation, favoring clearer skies and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
