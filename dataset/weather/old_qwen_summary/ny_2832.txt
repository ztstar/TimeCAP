Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the day, indicating a cold night transitioning into a milder afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a possible frontal passage or atmospheric instability. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the early morning, which then stabilized, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds diminished substantially overnight, reaching a minimum around dawn, before increasing slightly in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from the northwest to more southerly and variable patterns, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and windy night to a quieter and gradually warming day, likely under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
