Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, stabilizing in the early morning before beginning a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp feel. Air pressure dropped significantly through the late night and early morning, reaching a low before beginning to rise again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and potential for improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow, reinforcing the influence of a developing weather front. The shift in wind direction toward the south and then due east suggests the arrival of a new air mass, potentially bringing changes in temperature and precipitation in the near term.
