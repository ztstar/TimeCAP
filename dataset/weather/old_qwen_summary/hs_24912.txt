Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early hours. A persistent southerly to southwesterly wind regime was observed, with a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in air mass dynamics. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decline toward the end, indicating possible approaching weather system influence. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests increasing potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
