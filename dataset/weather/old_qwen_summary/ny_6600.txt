Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable temperature rise in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of warming air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night into the early morning, followed by a gradual decline, signaling a possible shift in weather patterns, potentially indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent northerly to westerly component in the early hours, followed by a shift toward more variable and stronger winds later in the day. These combined trends suggest a transition period in the weather, with potential for changing conditions, including possible precipitation later in the day.
