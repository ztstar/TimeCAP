Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early morning before sharply declining, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to drier air. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and improved visibility. Wind activity intensified during the night and early morning, with strong gusts from the southeast and east sectors, potentially contributing to the mixing of air and the dissipation of low-level fog. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds points to a shift toward a more stable, sunny, and breezy afternoon to evening pattern.
