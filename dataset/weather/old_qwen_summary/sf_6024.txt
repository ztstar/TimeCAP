Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the overnight period, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable but exhibited a slight upward trend in the latter half of the day, suggesting improving or stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by coastal influences and pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to the persistence of marine layer conditions, which are typical for San Francisco and may bring overcast skies and cool, damp mornings.
