Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, particularly during midday and early evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining through the afternoon, suggesting a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more dispersive air. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to more variable directions, with a brief increase in speed during the evening, possibly indicating a change in airflow due to the developing pressure gradient. These combined trends suggest the potential for unsettled weather in the near term, including possible thunderstorms or showers as the low-pressure system consolidates.
