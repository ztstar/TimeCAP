Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night, indicating the presence of saturated air and potential for fog or dew formation, which persisted through the early morning. Air pressure exhibited a marked increase in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly directions, accompanied by a reduction in speed overnight and a return to moderate speeds in the afternoon, consistent with changing boundary layer dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds in the afternoon points to a transition toward clearer skies and improved air quality, typical of a post-frontal weather regime.
