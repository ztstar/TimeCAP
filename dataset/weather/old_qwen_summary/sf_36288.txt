Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before beginning a slight recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a high plateau that persisted into the late afternoon, indicating increased moisture content in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual upward trend, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may be bringing drier, more stable conditions. Wind speeds decreased notably after midnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from cool, moist conditions to a potentially clearer and calmer period, though lingering humidity may support fog formation in coastal areas.
