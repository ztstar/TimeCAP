Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air likely associated with fog formation. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early hours suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the onset of fog and reduced visibility. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with calm conditions in the mid-morning and a resurgence of stronger winds in the late afternoon, likely driven by shifting pressure gradients. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and easterly, reflecting dynamic changes in atmospheric circulation that could signal evolving weather patterns.
