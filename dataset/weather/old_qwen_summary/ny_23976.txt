Temperatures steadily increased over the past 24 hours, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture content followed by a sharp decline, suggesting possible precipitation earlier in the day and clearing skies later. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early hours, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is often associated with stormy or unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate but spiked intermittently, especially in the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass influences. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a damp, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable one, potentially signaling the end of a brief weather disturbance.
