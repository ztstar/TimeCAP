Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late morning, marked by stronger and more variable winds, particularly from the southeast and east, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of major weather system passage, though slight increases were observed during the afternoon. These conditions collectively suggest a marine layer event, typical of San Francisco’s climate, with cool, moist air trapped near the surface and influenced by coastal wind dynamics.
