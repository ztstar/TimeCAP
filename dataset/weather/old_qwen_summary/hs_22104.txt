Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and maintaining near-saturated conditions, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric stability that could precede changing weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a consistent southeasterly to easterly flow, suggesting moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined conditions—high humidity, warming temperatures, and increasing wind—highlight a potential for developing thunderstorms, especially during the night hours.
