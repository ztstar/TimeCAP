Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising again in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early hours, indicating a high potential for fog or mist, which diminished as temperatures fell and air pressure rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow likely associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined patterns suggest the end of a moist, stagnant period and the onset of drier, more stable air, which may reduce the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
