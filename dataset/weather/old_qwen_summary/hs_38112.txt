Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of high humidity, with near-saturation levels persisting through the night and early morning, indicating favorable conditions for fog or dew formation. Temperature trends showed a steady rise from early morning through midday, followed by a gradual decline in the evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating and nighttime cooling. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly from late afternoon onward, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, consistent with a developing frontal influence. These combined factors point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, especially as the low-pressure system continues to intensify.
