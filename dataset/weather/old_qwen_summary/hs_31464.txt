Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point rise and subsequent drying as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a gradual rise throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system influence that likely stabilized conditions and contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and northeast, hinting at the arrival of a stronger synoptic-scale flow that may signal a shift in weather patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind speeds suggests a transition toward drier, potentially more unstable conditions, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
