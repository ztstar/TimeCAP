Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of high moisture in the early morning and late night, suggesting fog formation, while midday values dropped sharply, likely due to clearing skies and increased solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a notable rise in the late afternoon may indicate the influence of a high-pressure system approaching from the northwest. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late morning and early afternoon, with gusts from the west and southwest, implying a shift in airflow that could be linked to the movement of a marine layer or coastal breeze. Combined, these patterns suggest a dynamic interplay between maritime influence and local topography, contributing to variable and potentially unstable conditions, especially as the evening brings a return to cooler, more humid air.
