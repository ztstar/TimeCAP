Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern likely driven by increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the onset of a drying phase, possibly due to increased wind mixing and surface heating. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a distinct low-pressure dip followed by a rebound, which may signal the passage of a weather front or convective activity. Wind speeds increased steadily through the midday, peaking in the late afternoon before tapering off, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and eventually westward, indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow. These conditions together suggest the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the combination of rising temperatures, drying air aloft, and dynamic wind shifts.
