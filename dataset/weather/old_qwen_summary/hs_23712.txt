Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, peaking in the early morning and remaining near saturation, which contributes to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight increases in the mid-to-late period, suggesting a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions, though not indicative of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds declined significantly in the final hours, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the south and southwest, signaling a possible change in air mass or approaching weather pattern. The combination of elevated humidity, warming temperatures, and weakening winds points to a potential buildup of moisture and heat, increasing the likelihood of localized thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term.
