Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and eventually westerly, suggesting a change in air flow patterns consistent with frontal passage. These trends collectively point to a dynamic atmospheric shift, likely associated with an approaching weather front that could bring cloud cover, precipitation, or fog later in the day.
