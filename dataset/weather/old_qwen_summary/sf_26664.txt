Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, then plummeting dramatically in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-to-late afternoon, peaking before dropping slightly, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a pronounced increase in the evening and a brief surge during the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a shift from coastal fog and marine influence toward a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
