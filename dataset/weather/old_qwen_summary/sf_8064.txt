Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture in the air and potential for fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase, particularly during the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the night and early morning, with a shift toward more consistent, moderate winds in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to changing pressure gradients. The wind direction remained predominantly in the southwest to west quadrant, consistent with typical marine layer patterns, reinforcing the likelihood of coastal fog and cool conditions persisting into the next day.
