Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a consistent rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early and mid-night hours, dropping significantly in the latter half of the day, suggesting a drying trend as the atmosphere warmed. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, reflecting a transition from stable to slightly less stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a persistent southerly to southwesterly flow that likely contributed to the transport of moist air during the early phase. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns may signal the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
