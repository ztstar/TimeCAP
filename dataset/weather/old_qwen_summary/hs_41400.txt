Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure gradually increased through the night and early morning, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable conditions. Wind speeds picked up in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, consistent with a developing sea breeze or frontal influence. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more humid and unstable conditions, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
