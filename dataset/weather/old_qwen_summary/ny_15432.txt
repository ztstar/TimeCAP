Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady increase, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining, indicating a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated through the early morning hours before beginning to decrease, suggesting moisture accumulation followed by dispersion. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching notable levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with storm development. These combined factors point to the influence of an approaching frontal system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
