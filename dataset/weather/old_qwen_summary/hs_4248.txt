Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, stabilizing at high values during the early hours before dropping sharply during the late morning and afternoon, indicating a drying trend linked to warming conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night and into the morning, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, likely contributing to the warming and moisture transport. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward a more unstable and potentially storm-prone environment, particularly as the night progresses.
