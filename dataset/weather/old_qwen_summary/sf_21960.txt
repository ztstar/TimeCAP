Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region during evening and early morning hours. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system that could bring prolonged overcast conditions or light precipitation. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early part of the period but diminished during the late night and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a coastal weather pattern dominated by marine influence, with potential for persistent fog and cool, damp conditions into the coming hours.
