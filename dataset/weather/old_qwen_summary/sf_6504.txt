Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking during the overnight hours, which is characteristic of marine layer development and fog formation common in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations suggesting no significant weather systems passing through, consistent with a persistent high-pressure ridge typical of the area’s summer climate. Wind speeds were generally light, with extended periods of calm or very low wind, particularly during the night, which contributed to the trapping of moisture and fog near the surface. Wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more northerly and easterly in the afternoon, signaling a possible change in airflow pattern, potentially indicating the onset of a sea breeze or the influence of shifting pressure gradients.
