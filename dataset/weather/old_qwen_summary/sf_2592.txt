Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may have brought the increased moisture and wind activity. Wind speeds increased during the early morning hours and shifted from southerly to westerly directions, indicating a change in atmospheric flow that could promote coastal upwelling and cooler conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a more maritime, fog-prone pattern typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly along the coast.
