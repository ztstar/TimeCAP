Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase toward the late afternoon, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of significant storm systems. Wind speeds were consistently low, with a minor increase in the final hour, suggesting limited air mixing and persistence of localized fog and low-level moisture. The shift in wind direction throughout the day, particularly a notable change toward the northwest in the late afternoon, may signal a developing onshore flow, potentially bringing cooler marine air and influencing coastal conditions.
