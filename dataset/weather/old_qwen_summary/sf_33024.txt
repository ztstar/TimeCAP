Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon before rising again in the evening, indicating a shift in air mass. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the mid-to-late night, peaking in the early morning before a sharp decline later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified during the night, particularly in the early hours, with strong westerly to southwesterly winds dominating, likely influenced by coastal dynamics. The change in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then back to westerly, combined with pressure and temperature shifts, points to the influence of a frontal passage, potentially bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
