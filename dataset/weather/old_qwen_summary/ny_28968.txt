Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. A significant drop in humidity during the early morning hours signaled the passage of a dry air mass, which likely contributed to the temperature decrease. Air pressure rose sharply in the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased during the overnight hours, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast in the late morning, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow that may precede a shift in weather. The combination of cooling temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing pressure points to a period of dry, stable weather, though a recent shift in wind direction could signal an approaching change in conditions.
