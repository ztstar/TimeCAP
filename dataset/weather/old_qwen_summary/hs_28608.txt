Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that contributed to condensation and potentially fog or dew formation. A notable pressure fluctuation occurred mid-morning, with a brief spike followed by a sustained decline, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system influencing local conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with occasional increases linked to shifts in wind direction, including a shift from southerly to westerly and then southerly-southeasterly flows, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest an environment conducive to unstable weather, potentially increasing the likelihood of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
