Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover typical of coastal conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day, with a slight rise in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a weak high-pressure system. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with only brief bursts of moderate wind from the southeast and south-southwest during the mid-morning and late afternoon, possibly linked to diurnal coastal breezes. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and intermittent winds points to a high likelihood of fog persistence or formation, particularly in low-lying coastal and valley areas.
