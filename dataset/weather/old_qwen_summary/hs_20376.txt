Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling improving weather and the potential for clearer skies ahead. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then to a southwesterly flow, hinting at a change in air mass influence. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speed, and stable temperatures points to a transition toward more stable and pleasant conditions in the coming hours.
