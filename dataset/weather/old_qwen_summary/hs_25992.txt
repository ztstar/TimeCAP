Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a stable nighttime inversion that broke during the afternoon. Humidity levels reached near-saturation during the early morning hours, with multiple periods of 100% humidity, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. A significant drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, signaling the possible influence of a passing weather system. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to more variable and then easterly directions, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow, possibly related to a frontal passage or low-pressure development. The combination of high moisture, fluctuating pressure, and shifting winds implies a heightened potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as temperatures rise and atmospheric instability increases.
