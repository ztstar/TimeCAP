Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased comfort discomfort. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that likely brought stable conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained generally light overnight, with a notable shift to stronger winds in the late afternoon, likely associated with a change in airflow from the southeast to the southwest, possibly signaling the approach of a boundary or frontal influence. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests a high likelihood of isolated thunderstorms developing later in the day, particularly if daytime heating intensifies.
