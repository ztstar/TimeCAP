Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels reached near saturation in the early hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture front or convective activity. Air pressure showed a consistent rise during the early morning and late afternoon, pointing to the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a cold front. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable environment to a drier, more settled regime, with potential for improved visibility and reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
