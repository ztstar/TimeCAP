Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with prolonged periods of saturated air conditions in the early morning and late night, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure exhibited multiple rapid changes, including a significant drop followed by sharp spikes, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability and possible passing frontal systems. Wind patterns were highly variable, with strong gusts from the west and southwest during peak hours, potentially contributing to coastal upwelling and the dispersion of fog. The combination of cool temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind directions suggests an active marine layer influence, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather patterns.
