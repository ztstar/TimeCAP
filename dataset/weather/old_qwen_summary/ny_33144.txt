Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, remaining near saturation before gradually declining, indicating a period of stable, moist air that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a notable initial spike, followed by a sustained decline, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to easterly directions, with speeds increasing in the evening, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
