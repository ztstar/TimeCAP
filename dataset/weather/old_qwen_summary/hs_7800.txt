Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and early evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining steadily into the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture. A notable pressure increase occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop later in the day, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating possible air mass changes. These patterns collectively suggest the possibility of developing convective activity later in the evening or overnight, particularly given the combination of residual moisture and destabilizing thermal trends.
