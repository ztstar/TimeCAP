Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon, indicating the onset of a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, creating a damp and muggy atmosphere. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred during the late morning, with wind speeds increasing and direction shifting toward the southeast, suggesting the arrival of a moist air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early morning and midday, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speed in the afternoon suggests improving conditions, with a transition toward more comfortable and stable weather in the coming hours.
