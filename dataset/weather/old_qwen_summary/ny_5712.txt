Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred overnight, followed by a steady rise through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend succeeded by daytime warming. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, then plummeted dramatically during the afternoon, suggesting a clearing of moist air and potential for drier conditions. Air pressure remained elevated through the night and early morning, then began a gradual decline, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric stability. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with sustained calm conditions, but picked up in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west, potentially bringing in drier air. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward clearer skies and improved daytime conditions, though localized breezes may persist into the evening.
