Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, stabilizing in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching high levels, driven by fluctuating wind directions that shifted toward the northwest and west, consistent with a strengthening pressure gradient. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and variable but generally strong winds points to a transition toward potentially unsettled conditions, possibly including scattered showers later in the day.
