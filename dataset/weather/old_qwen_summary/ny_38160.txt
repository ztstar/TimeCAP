Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early to mid-period, suggesting prolonged moisture presence, which likely contributed to fog or drizzle conditions. A continuous decline in air pressure through the night and early morning points to an approaching low-pressure system, consistent with developing stormy weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then westerly, indicating a change in circulation patterns typical of frontal passage. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing pressure, and strong winds implies a dynamic and potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and storm development in the near term.
