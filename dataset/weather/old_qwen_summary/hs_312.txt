Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near-saturation during the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist and reduced visibility. A sustained increase in air pressure during the late morning and early afternoon suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the late night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with shifts in wind direction that suggest changing airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, variable wind, and pressure changes indicates a transition period that may precede a shift in weather, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms if moisture and instability continue to accumulate.
