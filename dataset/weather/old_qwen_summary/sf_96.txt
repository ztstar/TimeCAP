Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels reached near-saturation during the early morning hours, coinciding with a significant drop in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the presence of stable, moist air near the surface. A sharp decline in air pressure during the early hours indicates the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the overcast conditions and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with calm periods aligning with the highest humidity and fog formation, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic coastal fog. As the day progressed, winds increased again and shifted toward more easterly and southerly directions, potentially signaling a transition toward clearer skies and milder conditions.
