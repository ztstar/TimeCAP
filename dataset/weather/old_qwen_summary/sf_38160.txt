Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Temperature trends indicate a cooling phase overnight, with a slight warming in the late afternoon, consistent with diurnal patterns and coastal influence. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking at saturation during early morning and midday, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions, possibly linked to a coastal breeze or frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests changing air mass dynamics, potentially signaling a transition in the local weather regime.
