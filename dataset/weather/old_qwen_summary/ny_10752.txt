Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning, indicating a cold overnight period. Humidity remained consistently high throughout most of the day, with a brief but notable drop during midday, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, which typically signals improving weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, with a peak near evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable, possibly indicating the influence of a passing front. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising pressure, and increased wind suggests a transition toward clearer and cooler conditions, potentially bringing a brief period of relief from the previous damp, stagnant air.
