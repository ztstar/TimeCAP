Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed early in the period, followed by a steady warming, indicating the arrival of a milder air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply after the initial hours, peaking at saturation, which, combined with dropping air pressure, suggests the onset of precipitation. The pressure continued to decline steadily, reaching a low point before beginning a slight recovery, signaling an active weather system passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with the passage of a frontal system. These conditions point to a likely period of rain or drizzle in the early morning hours, with clearing expected later as pressure stabilizes and winds ease.
