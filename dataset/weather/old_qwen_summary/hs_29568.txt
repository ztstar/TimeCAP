Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the pre-dawn period, peaking during the early hours before plummeting in the late morning, suggesting a possible passage of a cold front or a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a notable rise in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest, while wind direction shifted from easterly to more southerly and westerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest that Houston transitioned from a cooler, more humid air mass to a drier, warmer, and more stable regime, likely resulting in clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
