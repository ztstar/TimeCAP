Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing or drying trend. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the midday and early evening, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly wind directions, possibly signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, which may lead to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
