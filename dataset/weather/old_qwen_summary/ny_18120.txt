Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking overnight, and then decreased in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were relatively low overnight, with a notable increase during the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds points to improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies in the coming hours.
