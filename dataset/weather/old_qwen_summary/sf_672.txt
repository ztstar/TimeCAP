Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升 in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the nighttime and early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought stable and dry conditions during the late morning and afternoon. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning hours, particularly from the northwest, but diminished significantly by midday, with calm conditions prevailing before a light resurgence in the evening. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly in the late evening suggests a possible change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass or the onset of coastal upwelling effects.
