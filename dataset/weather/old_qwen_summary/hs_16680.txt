Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and dropping significantly during the night before stabilizing in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching a peak in the early hours before slightly declining, indicating increasing moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the influence of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more northeasterly, consistent with changing circulation patterns around the developing system. These combined indicators point to a transition toward more unstable and potentially stormy weather in the coming hours.
