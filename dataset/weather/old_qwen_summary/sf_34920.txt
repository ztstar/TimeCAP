Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting a period of increased moisture saturation likely linked to marine layer development. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of significant weather system movement across the region. Wind speeds were consistently low, with brief periods of light wind, and the wind direction shifted dramatically from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, reflecting changes in localized flow patterns. These conditions point to a strong marine layer influence during the night and early morning, which has since begun to break down, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
