Temperature showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before rising sharply during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with high levels during the night and early morning giving way to drier conditions in the late afternoon, followed by a sudden increase in the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but dropped sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwesterly to westerly sectors, possibly linked to a developing offshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the evening and the rise in humidity may signal the onset of marine layer development, potentially leading to fog or low clouds overnight.
