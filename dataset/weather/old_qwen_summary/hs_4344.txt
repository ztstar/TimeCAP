Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which may have contributed to a damp and uncomfortable feel. A significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating the passage of a weather front that likely brought brief instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and southeast, potentially signaling the approach of a developing system. Overall, the data suggest a dynamic transition in Houston’s weather, with conditions shifting from cool and humid to warmer and more variable, possibly setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
