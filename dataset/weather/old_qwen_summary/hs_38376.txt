Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or the onset of a drying phase. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, with a pronounced drop in the late afternoon, a strong indicator of approaching low-pressure systems that may bring instability. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with the development of a frontal or convective system. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or precipitation in the near term.
