Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the afternoon and evening hours, indicating increasing heat accumulation. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a steady decline, particularly in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with developing convective activity. Combined with fluctuating wind direction and a drop in pressure, these conditions point to a potential for thunderstorms or unstable weather in the near term.
