Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced overnight dip followed by a steady rise, indicating a cold night transitioning into a warmer day. Humidity levels climbed significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the west and south, consistent with a developing frontal passage. Combined with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and southeasterly, these trends point to dynamic atmospheric changes that could lead to precipitation or stormy conditions later in the day.
