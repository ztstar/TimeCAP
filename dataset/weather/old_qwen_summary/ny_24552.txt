Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the afternoon and evening, suggesting drier air masses were moving in, which may reduce the likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon and remaining high, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clear and calm conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, implying a shift in wind flow likely associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. Overall, the data suggests improving weather with decreasing cloud cover, lower humidity, and stable atmospheric conditions, conducive to pleasant, dry conditions for the next 24–48 hours.
