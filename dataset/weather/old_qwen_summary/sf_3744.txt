Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase, particularly in the late night and early morning, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds intensified through the night and early morning, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then easterly, which may have contributed to coastal fog formation and enhanced mixing. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds, and dropping humidity suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward a more stable and sunny regime in the coming hours.
