Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, suggesting a cooling trend, likely due to the influence of a shifting air mass. Humidity levels remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the latter part of the period, indicating moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate and consistent, but a notable shift in wind direction—from southerly to northerly—occurred around midday, potentially indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward drier and more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
