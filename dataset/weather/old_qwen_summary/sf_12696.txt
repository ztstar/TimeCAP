Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating the presence of persistent moisture, likely associated with marine influence. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the day, then dropped sharply in the late evening, signaling the possible approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning but diminished significantly during the midday hours, only to increase again in the late evening, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns. The change in wind direction from westerly to northerly and eventually easterly may reflect the influence of a developing low-pressure system or a shift in coastal flow.
