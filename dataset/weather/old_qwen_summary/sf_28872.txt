Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, frequently near saturation, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which contributed to foggy conditions during the night and early morning. A sustained increase in air pressure, particularly from midday onward, suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before tapering off, with a pronounced shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then easterly, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined factors point to a transition from a maritime-influenced, fog-prone regime toward a more stable, potentially sunny afternoon, though residual moisture may linger.
