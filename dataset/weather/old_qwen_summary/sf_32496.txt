Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal atmospheric dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests the presence of marine fog or low cloud cover common in the region during this time of year. Air pressure showed a slight rise in the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind patterns were variable but generally light, with brief bursts of stronger winds from the west and northwest, consistent with offshore flow or sea breeze oscillations. These conditions point to a transition from a cool, moist, and foggy marine layer toward a drier, clearer, and slightly warmer regime, typical of midday conditions along the San Francisco coastline.
