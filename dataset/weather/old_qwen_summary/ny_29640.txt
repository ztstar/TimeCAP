Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold night transitioning into a milder day. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited a sharp rise in the mid-morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of these factors points to a transition from a cold, moist, and stable nighttime regime to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime pattern.
