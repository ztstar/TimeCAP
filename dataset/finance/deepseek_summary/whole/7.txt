The S&P 500 demonstrated a generally upward trend over the past 20 market days, with notable volatility in the middle period before stabilizing near recent highs, indicating resilience amid shifting investor sentiment. The VIX showed a pronounced spike mid-period, reflecting heightened market fear, followed by a sustained decline, suggesting a return to calm and reduced uncertainty. Global equity markets, including the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, displayed mixed but largely positive momentum, with the Nikkei showing strength in the latter half, while the FTSE experienced a sharp rebound after a downturn. Commodities such as gold and crude oil both exhibited upward trajectories, reinforcing safe-haven demand and strengthening supply-side pressures, respectively. Exchange rates remained relatively stable, with the euro and yen showing minor fluctuations, while the yuan maintained a gradual depreciation trend, pointing to ongoing macroeconomic pressures in China.
