Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast and east, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with the possibility of precipitation later in the day.
