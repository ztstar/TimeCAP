Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a return to higher pressure values later in the day, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure recovery. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, particularly in the hours of lowest temperature, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a strong gust recorded toward dawn, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a dynamic weather transition, likely involving coastal fog development and a shift in wind patterns typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
