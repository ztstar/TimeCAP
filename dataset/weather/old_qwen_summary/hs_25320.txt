Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend overnight and warming during daylight. Humidity levels peaked at near saturation during the night and early morning, declining sharply in the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting the air was saturated during the coolest part of the day. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before gradually falling, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and northerly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting winds suggests an environment conducive to potential afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the day warmed and instability developed.
