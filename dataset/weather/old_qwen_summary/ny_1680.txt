Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady temperature rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and continued through the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system associated with unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds decreased during the early morning, particularly around dawn, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and eventually southeasterly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a high probability of rain or drizzle in the near term, with potentially damp and overcast conditions persisting into the evening.
