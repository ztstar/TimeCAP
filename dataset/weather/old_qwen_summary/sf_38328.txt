Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before steadily declining, indicating a shift toward drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained light throughout most of the period, with brief spikes in the morning and again in the evening, accompanying shifts in wind direction from northwest to southeast, hinting at changing local airflow patterns. These observations suggest a transition from cool, fog-prone conditions to clearer, warmer air, which may influence visibility and comfort levels in the region.
