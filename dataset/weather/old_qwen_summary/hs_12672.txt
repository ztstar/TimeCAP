Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before gradually declining through the day, suggesting nocturnal condensation and morning fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend through the night and early morning, stabilizing midday before continuing to decline, which may reflect the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, implying a change in airflow that could signal the onset of a weather front. These combined patterns suggest a transition period likely associated with a developing storm system, increasing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms and deteriorating conditions later in the day.
