Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of diurnal temperature variation typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, dropping significantly during daylight hours, indicating a transition from marine fog conditions to drier, clearer air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight drop toward the end of the period may suggest an approaching weather change. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly, consistent with the development of a land breeze or local circulation. The combination of rising temperatures, declining humidity, and increasing wind speeds points to the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of a more stable, sunnier day, which could lead to a warmer afternoon and potential for enhanced air quality.
