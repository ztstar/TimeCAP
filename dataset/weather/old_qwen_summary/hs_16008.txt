Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity, though a slight drop in the early morning may hint at localized atmospheric changes. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and southwesterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest the influence of a nocturnal boundary layer adjustment and a possible onshore flow shift, which could contribute to increased cloud cover or instability later in the day.
