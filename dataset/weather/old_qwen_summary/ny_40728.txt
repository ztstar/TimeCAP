Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming phase in the afternoon, indicating the influence of solar heating and a developing high-pressure system. Humidity remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting fog or mist formation, which gradually decreased as temperatures rose and air pressure increased. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late afternoon, with stronger winds from a consistent direction, likely signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or a change in synoptic-scale flow. The sustained rise in air pressure throughout the day reflects the dominance of a stable high-pressure system, contributing to improving conditions and reducing the likelihood of precipitation. Overall, the data suggests a transition from damp, calm conditions to clearer, warmer, and breezier weather, with potential for continued stabilization into the coming hours.
