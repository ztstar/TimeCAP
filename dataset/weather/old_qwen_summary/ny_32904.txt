Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a cooling trend overnight and subsequent warming as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or drizzle during the early morning hours, particularly when temperatures were near dew point. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late evening, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought overcast skies and precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, with peak gusts from the southeast, contributing to a more unstable atmosphere and potential for scattered showers. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly in the final hours suggests a change in air mass, potentially clearing skies and bringing drier conditions in the coming hours.
