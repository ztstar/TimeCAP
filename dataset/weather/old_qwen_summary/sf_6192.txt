Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon—suggesting the influence of a clearing sky and reduced marine layer. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, particularly in the late afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with a lull near dawn, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by developing sea breeze patterns. The shift from predominantly westerly and southerly winds at night to more variable and northerly directions in the afternoon reflects changing local circulation, potentially linked to temperature gradients and the onset of afternoon convection.
