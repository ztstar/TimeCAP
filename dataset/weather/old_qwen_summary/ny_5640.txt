Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning hours, indicating a strong nocturnal heat loss likely influenced by clear skies and low wind speeds. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple spikes to saturation, particularly during the early morning, suggesting potential for fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the middle of the night, followed by a steady rise, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of more stable, higher-pressure conditions. Wind patterns were variable, with periods of calm and sudden increases in speed, especially in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifts in direction that reflect changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable regime, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
