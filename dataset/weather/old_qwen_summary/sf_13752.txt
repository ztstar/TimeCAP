Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply, suggesting the presence of fog or low stratus clouds that likely dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the morning and early afternoon, reaching a peak before a sudden drop late in the evening, which may indicate the approach of a weather system or a localized atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds intensified during the midday hours, with strong northerly and westerly flows, then diminished overnight before picking up again in the final hours, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns driven by thermal gradients. The shift in wind direction from west-northwest to more easterly and southeasterly in the late evening hints at changing synoptic influences, potentially signaling a shift in local weather conditions, including possible fog development or a change in air mass.
