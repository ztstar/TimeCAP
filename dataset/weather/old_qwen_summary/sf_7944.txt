Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near 100%, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal areas. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the night, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and calm conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the pre-dawn hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of a shift in local wind patterns. The change in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more variable directions points to evolving synoptic conditions, potentially signaling the onset of a new weather phase in the region.
