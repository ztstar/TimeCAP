Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a gradual increase throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable and fair conditions. Wind speeds were generally low at night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable, drier, and potentially warmer conditions in the coming hours.
