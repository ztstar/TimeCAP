Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and a shift toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist and a muggy feel. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable weather in the coming hours. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to more northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and stable pressure suggests a high likelihood of humid, warm conditions with potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
