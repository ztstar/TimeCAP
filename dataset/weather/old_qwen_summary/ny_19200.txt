Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual rise, beginning in the early morning hours and peaking during the afternoon, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels experienced a significant drop during midday, followed by a sharp increase in the late evening, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions.
