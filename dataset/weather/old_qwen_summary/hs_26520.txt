Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early hours, indicating near-constant fog or mist conditions, which likely reduced visibility and created a damp, heavy air quality. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest, which may have contributed to the destabilization of the atmosphere. These combined factors—high moisture, fluctuating pressure, and shifting winds—suggest an elevated risk of isolated thunderstorms or heavy downpours later in the day.
