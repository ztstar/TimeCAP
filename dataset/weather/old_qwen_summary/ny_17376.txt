Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were elevated during the early hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure steadily decreased during the night and early morning, followed by a slight leveling off, pointing to a weakening low-pressure system or the approach of a cold front. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon, particularly from the northeast, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that hints at changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass, likely bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
