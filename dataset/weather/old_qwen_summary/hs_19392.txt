Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation for much of the night and early morning, which increases the likelihood of fog and discomfort. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief drop followed by a slight rise, suggesting a passing weather system without strong frontal activity. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning, with gusts reaching higher intensities, and wind direction shifted dramatically from easterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns likely related to a low-pressure influence. These conditions collectively suggest the presence of a moist, unstable air mass with potential for localized showers or thunderstorms, especially as the overnight cooling may enhance atmospheric instability.
