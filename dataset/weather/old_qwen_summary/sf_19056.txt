Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day before leveling off in the evening. Humidity remained consistently high, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the middle of the day, followed by a steady decline in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and evening, with consistent southerly to easterly winds, which may have brought in maritime air and enhanced coastal fog development. These conditions together suggest a period of stable, cool, and fog-prone weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for continued coastal fog and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
