Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity remained elevated for much of the day before dropping sharply in the early morning, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or clearing conditions. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings more stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with sustained strong winds from the northwest and west, likely due to a developing pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, unstable environment to a drier, more stable atmosphere, potentially reducing the chance of precipitation in the near term.
