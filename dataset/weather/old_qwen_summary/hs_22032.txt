Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the presence of overnight moisture accumulation and subsequent drying during daylight hours. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, especially in the latter half of the period, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system potentially bringing unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, consistent with a developing moisture inflow and possible storm development. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward increasingly unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
