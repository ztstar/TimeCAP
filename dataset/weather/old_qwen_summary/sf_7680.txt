Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal fog and daytime warming. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which is consistent with the formation and persistence of low cloud cover and fog common in the region during evening and early morning hours. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm activity and contributed to stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period during the early morning hours, and wind direction shifted from offshore to more variable, possibly indicating changes in local wind patterns linked to the bay’s thermal dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, stable nocturnal environment toward a clearer, more moderate afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
