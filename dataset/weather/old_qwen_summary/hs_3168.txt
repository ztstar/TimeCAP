Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during midday followed by a sharp drop in the late evening, suggesting the passage of a cooling front. Humidity levels were consistently high in the early hours, then declined significantly during the afternoon before rebounding slightly in the night, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a low point in the early evening before recovering, which is typical of an approaching or passing storm system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, consistent with storm development and frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest that a strong weather system moved through the region, likely bringing thunderstorms and potentially heavy rain, with the potential for localized flooding and gusty winds.
