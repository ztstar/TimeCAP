Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating the onset of a warming trend, likely due to increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, remaining near saturation during early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the midday and early evening, followed by a sharp increase in the late evening, which may indicate the passage of a cold front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, contributing to the dispersion of moisture and potential clearing of skies. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather shift, likely leading to improving conditions with cooler, drier air arriving later in the night.
