Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, with conditions becoming increasingly cold during the early morning hours before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the air and contributing to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the night, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the influence of a shifting weather system, possibly a passing front. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night, culminating in light winds during the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in air mass. These trends collectively suggest a cold front passage, likely bringing prolonged overcast conditions and a risk of freezing drizzle or light precipitation as the system continues to evolve.
