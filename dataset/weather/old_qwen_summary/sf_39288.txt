Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming toward midday. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking above 90% in several instances, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with typical coastal conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating an approaching weather system, likely a low-pressure front, which may bring increased cloud cover and potential precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with gusts from the west-southwest, followed by a shift to stronger northeasterly winds in the late morning, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime, with a heightened chance of fog or light drizzle in the coming hours.
