Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in air pressure, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which, combined with cooling temperatures, suggests increasing chances of fog or light precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the middle of the period, particularly from the south-southeast, before tapering off in the late evening, indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation. The wind direction transitioned from southerly to more westerly, consistent with changing flow patterns associated with frontal passage. These conditions collectively point to an active coastal weather system, likely contributing to overcast skies and a damp, cool feel across the city.
