- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a notable decline in the early hours, followed by a significant rebound later in the period, indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions. A pronounced dip was observed mid-cycle, likely reflecting a transient dry air intrusion, which was subsequently reversed by a sustained increase, suggesting the arrival of more moisture-laden air. The sustained high readings toward the end imply a stable, humid environment, potentially conducive to discomfort and increased likelihood of precipitation.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a steady upward trend over the initial 18 hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically correlates with stable and clear weather conditions. A subsequent decline in pressure during the final six hours suggests the approach of a low-pressure system or a weather front, potentially bringing increased cloud cover, precipitation, or wind. The overall pattern reflects a transition from stable to more dynamic atmospheric conditions, warranting attention to potential changes in weather over the coming hours.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature has exhibited a steady decline over the initial 12 hours, reaching a minimum before rebounding with a gradual increase in the subsequent period. A notable anomaly occurs at the 12-hour mark, where a sharp rise is followed by fluctuating stability, suggesting possible localized atmospheric or measurement-related influences. The overall pattern indicates a nocturnal cooling trend followed by early morning recovery, consistent with typical diurnal cycles in urban environments.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speeds exhibited a steady decline from peak levels in the early period, stabilizing at near-minimum values during the latter half of the 24-hour span. A notable anomaly occurred mid-period with a sharp drop to near-zero winds, suggesting a temporary lull or shift in atmospheric conditions. The subsequent recovery to low but consistent values indicates a return to subdued wind activity, which may reflect the influence of a developing high-pressure system or localized weather stabilization.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction has exhibited significant variability over the past 24 hours, shifting from predominantly northwest to southwest and then abruptly reversing toward the northeast and southeast sectors. A notable shift occurred around the 12-hour mark, where a rapid transition from the southwest to the northeast quadrant suggests a possible frontal passage or change in local atmospheric pressure systems. This fluctuation indicates dynamic and unstable air mass movement, which may be associated with evolving weather conditions such as approaching storms or changing wind shear patterns.
