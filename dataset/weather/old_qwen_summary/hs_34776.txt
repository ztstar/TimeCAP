Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping abruptly during midday, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, but wind direction underwent a marked change, shifting from southerly to easterly and then to northerly, reflecting evolving synoptic-scale flow patterns. These developments suggest the transition from a moist, stable coastal environment to a drier, potentially more unsettled regime, with implications for fog dissipation, heat retention, and the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
