Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout most of the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and low cloud cover. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late morning, with wind speeds increasing and direction changing from westerly to southerly, suggesting a transition in air mass influence. The atmospheric pressure showed a brief rise midday, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system. These dynamics point to an evolving coastal weather pattern, with potential for fog dissipation in the afternoon and increasing wind activity later in the evening.
