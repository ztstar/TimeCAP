Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, with prolonged periods of high moisture, especially in the early morning and late night, suggesting potential for fog or drizzle. A sharp and sustained decrease in air pressure occurred during the middle of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system. The wind direction shifted from southwest to more variable and eventually toward the northeast, consistent with storm development and movement through the region. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the immediate forecast.
