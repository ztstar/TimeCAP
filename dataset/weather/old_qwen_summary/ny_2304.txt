Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong overnight and in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction suggesting changing air mass dynamics, particularly from westerly to more southerly and then easterly flows. Humidity levels remained relatively low to moderate, especially during peak warming hours, suggesting dry air masses prevailed. The combination of rising pressure, declining humidity, and decreasing wind speeds in the final hours points to a clear, calm evening ahead, likely with minimal precipitation risk.
