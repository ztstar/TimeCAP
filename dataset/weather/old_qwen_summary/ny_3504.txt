Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, especially in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight and into the early morning, then sharply declined during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend likely associated with a changing air mass. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a significant spike midday, suggesting the passage of a weather front, likely a low-pressure system followed by a high-pressure build-up. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift toward more northerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with a developing storm system or frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
