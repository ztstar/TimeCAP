Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring stormy conditions. Temperature trends show a cooling period overnight followed by a steady rise through the morning and into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a warm front moving in. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and remained elevated before declining sharply during the afternoon, consistent with the arrival of drier air behind a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained winds from the southwest, potentially signaling the onset of strong gusts associated with the approaching system. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and then more southerly, combined with falling pressure and rising temperatures, points to an active weather pattern that could result in precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
