Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop in the evening, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted from northeasterly to southeasterly and then to more easterly directions, with sustained higher speeds during the midday and evening, consistent with a developing sea breeze or low-pressure influence. These combined trends suggest an evolving atmospheric setup that could lead to increased convective activity later in the day.
