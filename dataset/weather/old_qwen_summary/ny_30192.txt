Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a significant cooling period during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, then dropped steadily through the day, indicating the influence of a drier air mass moving in. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop during the early morning hours, followed by a recovery and stabilization, consistent with a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, likely contributing to the clearing of cloud cover and improved visibility. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to easterly suggests a change in air flow, potentially bringing fresher, drier air and setting the stage for clearer skies in the coming hours.
