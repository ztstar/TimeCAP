Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced consistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to a persistent cool and damp feel. Temperature remained near freezing for much of the period, with a notable dip during the early morning hours, signaling a prolonged cold spell. Air pressure showed a gradual rise toward the latter half of the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast, implying a change in air mass and possible influence from a developing weather front. These combined factors suggest the city was under the influence of a cold, moist air mass with signs of transitioning toward drier and more stable conditions later in the period.
