Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a weather system, followed by a slight rebound in the afternoon. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts shifting from southerly to more westerly directions, indicating a change in air mass. Combined, these patterns suggest the influence of a passing frontal system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including the risk of thunderstorms, in the near term.
