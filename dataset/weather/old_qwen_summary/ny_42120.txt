Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation before dropping slightly in the afternoon, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a consistent increase from the early morning through the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that has brought clearer skies and more settled conditions. Wind speeds remained light for most of the period, with notable increases in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass influences. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a moist, cooler night into a relatively stable and mild day, with diminishing chances of precipitation as the pressure continues to rise.
