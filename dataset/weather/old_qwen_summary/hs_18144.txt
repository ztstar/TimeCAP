Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a clear cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent and steady increase, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that has brought stable, dry air and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with calm conditions prevailing in the early morning, followed by a modest resurgence in the afternoon, likely due to daytime heating and surface-level pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly orientations, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns, which may signal an evolving weather regime with potential for fair conditions in the near term.
