Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through midday, suggesting saturated air conditions that could support fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight drop in the late night and early morning, followed by stabilization and a small dip later in the day, potentially signaling a weak low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, which may indicate changing synoptic-scale flow. Together, these patterns suggest a stable, humid air mass with the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as surface heating intensifies and wind patterns evolve.
