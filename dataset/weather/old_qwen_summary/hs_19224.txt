Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before steadily declining, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds increased during the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, potentially signaling the approach of a moist air mass. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a warmer, drier, and more dynamically active afternoon, with conditions favorable for fair weather but with increasing wind activity.
