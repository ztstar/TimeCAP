Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to a noticeable drop in perceived comfort. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the evening but began a gradual decline overnight, indicating possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, increased slightly in the late evening and early morning, and then showed brief bursts of stronger gusts, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly patterns suggests a changing air mass, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather system.
