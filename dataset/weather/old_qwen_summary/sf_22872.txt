Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely due to coastal fog formation. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a notable drop in the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a weak low-pressure system or frontal passage. Wind patterns shifted gradually from northwest to west-southwest, maintaining moderate speeds throughout, which contributed to the advection of cool, moist air from the Pacific Ocean. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s climate, resulting in foggy, cool mornings and mild afternoons.
