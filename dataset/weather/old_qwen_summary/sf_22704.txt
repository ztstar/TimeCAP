Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily, indicating a transition from damp, fog-prone conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period but showed a slight downward trend in the late evening, suggesting possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, with a shift toward stronger and more variable winds from the west to northwest sectors, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in weather patterns. These conditions together suggest a transition from a cool, foggy marine layer to a drier, breezier environment, which could influence visibility and outdoor comfort in the coming hours.
