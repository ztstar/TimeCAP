Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, consistent with the coastal climate’s nocturnal patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low and steady through the night, with a shift toward more southerly and then easterly wind directions, possibly influencing the movement of marine air and fog. These conditions collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern: cool, foggy mornings transitioning into mild, dry afternoons under a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
