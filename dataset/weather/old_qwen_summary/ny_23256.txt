Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating saturated air conditions possibly associated with fog or mist, which then declined sharply as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase in the mid-to-late period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from light southerly to northerly and then to easterly directions, with a brief burst of stronger winds in the late afternoon and evening, likely indicating changing frontal dynamics. These trends collectively point to a transition from a damp, cool, and calm period toward drier and slightly warmer conditions, typical of a post-frontal environment with improving visibility and stable atmospheric conditions.
