Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the day, with only slight decreases in the late afternoon and evening, reflecting stable atmospheric conditions without significant weather system movement. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm and brief bursts, while wind direction shifted from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly, indicating a change in surface airflow likely due to local topography and sea breeze dynamics. Together, these patterns suggest a relatively stable but fog-prone coastal environment, with potential for morning visibility reduction and cool conditions persisting into the early afternoon.
