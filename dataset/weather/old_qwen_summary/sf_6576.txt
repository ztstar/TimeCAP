Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach or influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speed remained consistently low throughout the day, with a minor increase toward the end, while wind direction shifted from a northwest to a more west-southwest flow, consistent with coastal influence. These patterns suggest a stable marine layer with diminishing fog and improving conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
