Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, suggesting fog formation or low cloud cover, which persisted into the mid-morning before gradually declining. Air pressure increased significantly during the early morning, likely signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which contributed to stabilizing conditions and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then northeast, reflecting changing air flow patterns associated with the high-pressure influence. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, damp, and foggy period to clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, typical of a coastal high-pressure ridge typical in San Francisco’s microclimate.
