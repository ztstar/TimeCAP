Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, especially in the early and late stages, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily decreased, reaching its lowest point toward the end of the period, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system likely bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the eastern to southeastern sectors, implying dynamic air mass movement and potential storm development. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term, with possible impacts on travel and outdoor activities.
