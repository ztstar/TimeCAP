Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation by mid-morning and remaining near 100% for much of the night, indicating significant moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight drop during the night and a return to higher values by late morning, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds were generally low after midnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast and then toward the east-southeast, reflecting changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions point to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with the potential for foggy mornings and cool, damp conditions through the day.
