Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation in the early morning and late evening, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a sharp rise followed by a sustained decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a steady increase during the afternoon and a strong peak in the late evening, likely associated with a change in wind direction from the south to the southwest. The shift in wind direction toward the west and south, combined with rising wind speeds and high humidity, points to the influence of marine air intrusion, which is typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate and may signal the onset of foggy or overcast conditions.
