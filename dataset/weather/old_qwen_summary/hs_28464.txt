Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from a cooler nocturnal period into a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike during the overnight and early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before a sharp decline, indicating possible moisture release or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the mid-to-late night and early morning, with a shift in direction toward the northeast, consistent with the approach of a drier, more stable air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and sustained winds suggests improving weather conditions, with potential for clearer skies and reduced risk of precipitation in the near term.
