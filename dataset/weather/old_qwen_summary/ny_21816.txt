A significant drop in air pressure was observed during the night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with stormy or unsettled weather. Temperature fluctuations showed a sharp decline in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the influence of a cold front moving through the region. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, then rose sharply in the afternoon, consistent with increasing moisture ahead of or within the storm system. Wind speeds intensified throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, signaling a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing precipitation and potentially gusty conditions in the near term.
