Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have facilitated the development of overcast conditions and light precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the day, with strong, consistent flow from the northwest, suggesting a shift toward more dynamic atmospheric conditions. The wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly during the night, followed by a pronounced change to a more westerly to southwesterly flow in the late evening, potentially signaling a change in air mass and the approach of a new weather regime.
