Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air layer to drier, more dynamic conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day, with a brief increase midday and a subsequent drop toward evening, consistent with a passing weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during early morning hours, increasing through the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then westerly, suggesting changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined trends point to a coastal transition typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, where marine air intrusion and land-sea temperature contrasts play a dominant role in shaping daily weather patterns.
