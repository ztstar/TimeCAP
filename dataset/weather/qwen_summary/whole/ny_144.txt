Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend interrupted by a mid-morning rebound. Humidity remained stable during the night before dropping sharply in the early morning, then rising sharply in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or approaching moisture inflow. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking midday before a slight drop, consistent with a passing high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speed diminished significantly overnight, with near-calm conditions at dawn, before increasing again in the afternoon, likely due to changing pressure gradients. Wind direction underwent a notable shift from westerly to southerly and then to northerly, indicating a complex atmospheric reorganization that may signal evolving weather patterns, potentially including an approaching storm system.
