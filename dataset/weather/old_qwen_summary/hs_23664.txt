Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning to recover slightly. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation under stable conditions. Air pressure remained consistently high and stable throughout the period, indicating sustained high-pressure dominance, which typically brings clear to partly cloudy skies and calm weather. Wind speeds were generally moderate, increasing in the late evening and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, signaling a possible change in air mass. This shift, combined with high humidity and stable pressure, suggests a low risk of precipitation but the potential for a cool, damp morning and a gradual warming trend into the day.
