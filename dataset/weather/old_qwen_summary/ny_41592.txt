Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent cooling trend, peaking in the early morning before steadily decreasing into the night, indicating a stable nocturnal cooling pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility in the early morning. A gradual decline in air pressure throughout the evening and into the early morning implies the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring unsettled weather, including precipitation, in the coming hours. Wind speeds were moderate with fluctuating direction, but a shift toward southerly and easterly winds in the late night may signal the influence of a developing frontal system. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially wet conditions in the immediate future.
