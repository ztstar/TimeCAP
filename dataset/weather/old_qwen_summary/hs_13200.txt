Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight and continued to increase into the late morning, suggesting moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the evening and into the early morning, with a sustained low-pressure trend that may signal the approach of a developing weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from northerly to easterly, which may reflect changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns suggest the potential for increasing instability and the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day, especially given the rising humidity and weakening pressure.
