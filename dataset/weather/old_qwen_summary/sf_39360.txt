Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure exhibited a strong rise during the early morning, peaking around dawn, followed by a steady decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities and shifting from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, which may be associated with a developing coastal breeze or storm influence. These combined factors point to an active weather transition, potentially bringing stronger winds and variable conditions overnight, with implications for visibility, travel, and outdoor activities.
