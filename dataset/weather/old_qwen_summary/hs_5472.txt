Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. A significant and sustained rise in air pressure occurred during the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought drier, more stable air. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger and more consistent airflow from the south-southeast, potentially aiding in the dispersal of moisture and moderating temperature increases. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest in the evening may signal a change in air mass, possibly indicating the approach of a weather front or the onset of convective activity later in the night.
