Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of the region’s coastal climate. A significant drop in air pressure occurred midday, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a rise in wind speed, indicating the passage of a weather front. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing synoptic conditions that may have brought in moist maritime air followed by drier, possibly inland air. These fluctuations suggest a dynamic atmosphere, with potential for fog dissipation in the afternoon and a possible return of marine layer conditions later in the day.
