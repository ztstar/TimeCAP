Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, accompanied by a sharp rise in humidity that reached near saturation levels, indicating the presence of moist, unstable air. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, followed by a slight drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front or disturbance. Wind speeds decreased significantly through the night, with a marked shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds points to the development of favorable conditions for precipitation. Given the current trend, there is a heightened likelihood of isolated thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.
