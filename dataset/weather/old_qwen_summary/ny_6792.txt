Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting a possible clearing of moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight rise in the late afternoon may signal improving conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase during the evening and a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and then the northeast, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more stable and potentially clearer skies in the near term.
