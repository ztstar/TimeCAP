Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual warming phase in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of dew formation or fog, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may be stabilizing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and southeasterly, which may signal changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime regime, with potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day if instability builds.
