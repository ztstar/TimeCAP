Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during those hours. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from the west to the south and southeast during midday suggests a change in atmospheric flow, possibly associated with a passing frontal system. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, indicating moderate synoptic activity without a strong high or low-pressure system dominating. These conditions point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with marine influence driving temperature moderation, fog development, and variable wind behavior.
