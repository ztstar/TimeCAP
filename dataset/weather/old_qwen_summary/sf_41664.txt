Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests fog formation and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction and increased wind speeds, pointing to the arrival of a weather front or synoptic-scale disturbance. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly directions, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the front. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from stable, foggy conditions to more variable and potentially unsettled weather, with a higher likelihood of precipitation or changing conditions in the near term.
