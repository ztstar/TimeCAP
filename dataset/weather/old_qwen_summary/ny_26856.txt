Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle with a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, suggesting a period of saturation likely due to cooling and condensation, which may have contributed to fog or mist. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, particularly in the early morning, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, pointing to a change in air mass and possible influence from regional circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the end of a cool, damp period and the onset of more stable, drier, and potentially clearer weather in the coming hours.
