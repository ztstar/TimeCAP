Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained stable to slightly rising, indicating a persistent high-pressure influence that has likely contributed to clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, hinting at a change in air mass or the influence of a weakening frontal boundary. Overall, the weather pattern suggests a transition from a cooler, moist period toward a drier, more stable afternoon, potentially setting the stage for a clear and mild day ahead.
