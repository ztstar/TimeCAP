Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, suggesting increasing solar heating and potential for elevated heat stress. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the mid to upper 80s, which combined with rising temperatures to create a muggy and oppressive atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the early morning, followed by slight recovery later, indicating possible atmospheric instability that could precede convective activity. Wind patterns displayed variable directions with notable shifts toward the southeast and east in the late evening, likely influenced by a developing low-pressure system or sea breeze dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and gusty winds in the late evening raises the potential for isolated thunderstorms, particularly during the overnight hours.
