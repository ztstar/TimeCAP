Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a cooling pattern during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition toward a more unstable atmosphere. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which increases the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, consistent with the inflow of moist air ahead of a frontal boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions and a persistent drop in pressure, these conditions point to an elevated probability of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
