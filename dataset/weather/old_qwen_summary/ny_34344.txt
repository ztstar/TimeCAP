Humidity levels dropped significantly during the late night and early morning, reaching their lowest point before rising again in the afternoon, suggesting a dry air mass influence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable and generally clear conditions.
