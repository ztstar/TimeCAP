Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the late morning, indicating consistent high-pressure influence, though a minor drop occurred toward the end of the period. Wind speeds were generally low overnight but increased in the afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions suggesting dynamic air circulation patterns, possibly due to coastal upwelling or sea breeze effects. These conditions point to a typical marine layer pattern, with cool, moist air trapped near the surface during the night and a gradual clearing and warming as the day progressed.
