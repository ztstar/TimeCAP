Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling phase overnight and a return to milder conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, signaling a possible front passage or change in air mass. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning hours, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with dynamic atmospheric adjustments following the pressure drop. These combined indicators point to a transition period marked by unstable conditions, potentially leading to scattered showers or thunderstorms in the coming hours, especially if moisture and lift persist.
