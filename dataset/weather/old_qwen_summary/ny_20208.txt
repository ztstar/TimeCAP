Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City remained consistently low during the early morning hours before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels were high in the early and late periods, peaking during the early morning and late evening, which may have contributed to a damp, chilly feel despite moderate temperature increases. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and improving weather conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal except for a slight uptick toward the end of the period, while wind direction shifted progressively from northeasterly to more westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. Collectively, these trends suggest a transition from a cold, humid, and stable air mass toward a drier and more moderate environment, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
