Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning a gradual回升 in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooler feel. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a rebound in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from a shifting direction, including southerly and westerly components, which may indicate an approaching system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a period of unstable weather, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy conditions later in the day.
