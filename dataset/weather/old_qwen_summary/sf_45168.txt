The weather in San Francisco has remained remarkably stable over the past 24 hours, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent conditions suggest a persistent high-pressure system is in place, contributing to dry and settled weather. Low humidity levels indicate arid atmospheric conditions, which may increase fire risk in nearby vegetation. Light, steady winds from a southeasterly direction imply limited air mixing, potentially trapping pollutants near the surface. Overall, the lack of change points to a prolonged period of dry, mild, and stable conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during certain seasons.
