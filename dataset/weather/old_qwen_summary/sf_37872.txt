Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply during midday, consistent with the dissipation of marine layer fog. A significant rise in air pressure occurred around midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds increased steadily through the morning and remained elevated through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, signaling changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool coastal environment to a warmer, drier, and more stable atmosphere, typical of a midday clearing event in the San Francisco Bay Area.
