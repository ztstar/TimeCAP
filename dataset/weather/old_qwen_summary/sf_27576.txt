Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dense low clouds, which dissipated as temperatures rose and winds shifted. A notable pressure drop occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, signaling a possible change in air mass, potentially bringing more moist and unstable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a distinct shift toward onshore flow, which may enhance coastal fog development. Overall, the data suggest the influence of a marine layer with potential for fog and patchy low clouds, particularly in the morning, with the possibility of mild, damp conditions persisting into the next day.
