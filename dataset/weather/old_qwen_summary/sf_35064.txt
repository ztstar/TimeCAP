Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before slightly declining, suggesting the presence of a dense, moist air mass that likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the mid-morning hours from the northwest, followed by a return to calm conditions, which may have allowed fog to persist. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast in the late afternoon hints at a potential change in air mass or the beginning of a circulation shift, possibly signaling a transition in the local weather pattern.
