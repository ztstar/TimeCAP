Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by maritime air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late evening, signaling the possible approach or passage of a high-pressure system that would bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west and southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and the influence of the Pacific high. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a milder, clearer day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
