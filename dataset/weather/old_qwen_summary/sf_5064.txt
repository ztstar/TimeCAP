Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before steadily declining through the night and into the early hours of the next day, followed by a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, beginning high in the morning, dropping sharply during midday, and then spiking again in the evening, indicating a possible fog or marine layer dissipation followed by a dry, stable period. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a significant rise in the early afternoon, followed by a sharp drop later in the evening, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or atmospheric disturbance. Wind patterns revealed a shift from light, consistent winds to stronger, variable gusts, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable change in direction coinciding with the pressure drop. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, likely involving the dissipation of coastal fog and the arrival of a more dynamic air mass, potentially leading to changing conditions overnight.
