Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure during the mid-morning hours, accompanied by a sudden increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, suggests the passage of a frontal system or a change in local atmospheric dynamics. The strong, gusty winds from the southeast and south in the late afternoon may have brought in warmer, drier air from inland areas, influencing the temperature rise and humidity decline. Overall, the data point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, variable wind patterns, and fluctuating pressure, which could signal ongoing instability and potential for changing conditions into the next day.
