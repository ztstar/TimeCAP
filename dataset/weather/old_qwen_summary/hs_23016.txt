Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the overnight hours and contributing to a muggy, oppressive feel, especially during the early morning. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, indicating a weakening high-pressure system and suggesting the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly including precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then to a southeasterly direction, with increasing speeds in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a moisture-laden air mass. Together, these indicators suggest a developing low-pressure influence, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
