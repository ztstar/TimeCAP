Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which later stabilized with minor fluctuations. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone nocturnal regime to a more dynamic and potentially windy afternoon, with implications for visibility and coastal conditions.
