Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, reaching near saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained consistently high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally low at night, with a notable lull around dawn, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal marine inversion event, where cool, moist air is trapped beneath a layer of warmer air, leading to persistent fog and mild temperatures—hallmarks of San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
