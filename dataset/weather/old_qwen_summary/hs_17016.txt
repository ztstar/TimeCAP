Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining through the night, indicating the onset of a nocturnal temperature drop. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure gradually increased through the night, stabilizing at a higher level, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings fair and dry conditions. Wind speeds diminished overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a high likelihood of fog or low visibility in the early morning hours, with generally calm and moist conditions persisting into the next day.
