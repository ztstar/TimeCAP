Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds showed variability, with notable increases in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from offshore to more onshore and then back offshore, potentially influencing coastal air flow and fog movement. The combination of these factors points to a transition from a fog-prone, cool marine layer to a drier, more stable afternoon regime, which is characteristic of typical San Francisco weather patterns during the summer months.
