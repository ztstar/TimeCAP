Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually warming through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through midday before dropping slightly in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated, with notable gusts in the early morning and late evening, primarily from the northwest and west, suggesting dynamic local wind patterns influenced by changing pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and weakening winds points to improving weather conditions and a transition toward drier, more stable air in the coming hours.
