Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and a damp, muggy feel in the early morning. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around mid-morning, transitioning from southerly to easterly and then to a southeasterly flow, suggesting the influence of a shifting pressure gradient. Air pressure fluctuated with a distinct low-pressure dip in the early hours, followed by a recovery, possibly signaling the passage of a weak frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind, and changing pressure patterns suggests a potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
