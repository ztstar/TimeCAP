Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by maritime conditions. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, remaining elevated through the night before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable dip during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise, which may signal the passage of a weather front or shifting pressure systems. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southerly and easterly, indicating changing airflow patterns likely driven by local topography and synoptic forces. These combined trends suggest that the city transitioned from a cool, foggy, and stable maritime environment to a drier, slightly warmer, and more dynamic atmospheric state, potentially leading to clearer skies and increasing wind activity in the coming hours.
