- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced decline after peaking in the early morning, suggesting a shift toward drier air conditions likely due to changing atmospheric dynamics or a passing weather front. A sustained period of low humidity in the late afternoon and evening indicates potential for increased comfort but also higher fire risk if accompanied by dry vegetation. The abrupt drop followed by a gradual recovery may reflect a transient atmospheric event, such as a cold front passage, which could be associated with changing weather conditions in the coming hours.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has shown a steady upward trend over the past 24 hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. A plateau in the upper range was observed for several hours, followed by a brief decline and subsequent stabilization, suggesting possible dynamic adjustments in atmospheric conditions. This pattern typically correlates with improving weather stability and reduced chances of precipitation, pointing toward clear or partly cloudy skies in the near term.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibits a steady decline during the initial phase, reaching a minimum before beginning a pronounced recovery, culminating in a peak near the end of the 24-hour period. The data reveals a clear diurnal pattern with a prolonged cooling trend followed by a rapid warming phase, suggesting possible nocturnal cooling and subsequent daytime heating or a reversal in atmospheric conditions. The brief dip and rebound near the end may indicate a transient meteorological event, such as a passing front or localized thermal fluctuation, warranting further investigation for forecasting accuracy.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a moderate increase in the early period, stabilizing at higher levels before a sharp decline toward the latter half of the 24-hour span. The most notable anomaly occurred during the final hours, with sustained near-zero values indicating a significant lull in wind activity. This abrupt transition suggests a possible shift in local atmospheric conditions, potentially signaling the approach or passage of a weather system with minimal wind, which could influence air quality and temperature stability.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a strong shift from predominantly westerly to northwesterly during the early and middle periods, suggesting stable high-pressure influence. A notable reversal occurred in the latter half, with a sharp transition to southerly and easterly directions, indicating a possible frontal passage or change in atmospheric dynamics. This abrupt shift, particularly the spike to easterly values followed by a return to northerly, implies active weather changes that could signal evolving storm systems or localized wind patterns.
