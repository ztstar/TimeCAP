Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, indicating a substantial diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours but rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the arrival of moist air, possibly linked to a weakening frontal boundary. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and into the early morning, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or inclement weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable drop during the overnight hours, but increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Together, these indicators suggest that Houston may be transitioning into a more unstable and potentially storm-prone period, particularly if the low pressure continues to deepen.
