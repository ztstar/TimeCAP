Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with high values in the early morning and late night, indicating potential fog formation, while low values during midday suggest clearing skies and drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations that suggest a steady weather pattern without major system movement. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with strong offshore flow from the northwest, which likely contributed to the cooling trend and fog dissipation. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the afternoon, combined with rising temperatures and decreasing humidity, points to the arrival of a warmer, drier air mass, typical of the region’s afternoon coastal dynamics.
