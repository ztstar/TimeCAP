Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady rise in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, indicating a daytime heating pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and late evening hours, suggesting moisture accumulation, possibly linked to a weakening low-pressure system. Air pressure steadily declined through the early to mid-day, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which is typical of approaching or passing frontal systems. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the south-southeast, likely contributing to the influx of warmer, moister air. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to westerly suggests a complex interaction of air masses, potentially signaling changing weather conditions in the near term.
