Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity remained high in the early hours, indicating fog or low-level moisture, but sharply declined during midday, suggesting clearing skies and drying air. Air pressure showed a steady increase, particularly toward the end of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon, especially from the southwest and west, consistent with a coastal breeze or marine layer influence, while wind direction shifted dramatically, reflecting changing flow patterns across the bay. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and moist morning to a warmer, drier, and more stable day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
