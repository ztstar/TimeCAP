Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, suggesting a transition from a cooler, stable period to a more moderate and increasingly warm phase. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during the late night and early morning hours. A significant rise in air pressure during the midday hours coincided with a shift in wind patterns, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light, with minimal variability until the late afternoon, when a brief increase in wind activity was observed, possibly signaling the arrival of a minor air mass boundary. These indicators collectively suggest a stabilizing atmosphere with limited convective activity, though residual moisture and slight pressure changes may still pose a risk for isolated afternoon showers.
