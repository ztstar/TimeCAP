Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of changing air masses. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air. Air pressure decreased notably in the afternoon, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased in the later afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that indicate a change in circulation patterns, possibly linked to the approaching system. These combined factors suggest a transition to potentially unstable conditions, with increased likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
