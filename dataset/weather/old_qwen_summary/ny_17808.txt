Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily increased, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high in the early morning and early afternoon, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure declined steadily throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening before rebounding slightly, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the approach of a changing weather front. These combined patterns suggest an active atmospheric transition, potentially leading to unsettled weather, including possible precipitation, in the near term.
