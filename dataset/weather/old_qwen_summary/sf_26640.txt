Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping significantly, indicating a possible passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure showed a marked drop in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to increased cloud cover and fog. Wind speed increased substantially in the final six hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation that may bring clearer skies or stronger gusts. These combined factors suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone maritime environment to a more dynamic and potentially windy regime.
