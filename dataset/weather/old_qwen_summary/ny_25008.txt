Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the midday, followed by a resurgence in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture influx. Air pressure dropped notably during the early hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and humidity. Wind speeds increased through the afternoon, with stronger gusts in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that reflect changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition in weather conditions, likely bringing unsettled or potentially stormy weather in the near term.
