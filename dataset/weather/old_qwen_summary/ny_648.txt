Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approaching influence of a low-pressure system, likely associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting a persistent cold air mass or increased cloud cover limiting solar heating. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and late evening, which, combined with dropping pressure and rising wind speeds, points to increasing instability and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds intensified notably during the late night and early morning hours, with strong gusts from the northeast, consistent with a frontal passage or storm system moving through the region. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a stormy weather pattern, with a high likelihood of rain or showers in the near term.
