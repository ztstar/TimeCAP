Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and continued into the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the late night and early morning hours before sharply declining through the afternoon, suggesting a drying air mass moving in. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before gradually increasing, which is indicative of a passing weather system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, shifting to lighter and more variable conditions by midday, with wind direction changing from southwest to more variable and eventually northeasterly. These patterns suggest the influence of a weakening low-pressure system followed by a transition to more stable, drier conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
