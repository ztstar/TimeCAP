Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, potentially signaling weakening high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, coinciding with a change in airflow that may have brought in drier air. These patterns collectively suggest the approach of a drier, more variable air mass, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential later in the day.
