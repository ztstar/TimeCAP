Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in temperature was observed during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a shift toward milder conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before decreasing slightly, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the potential for improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating a change in air mass and possible incoming weather changes. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather transition, with the potential for clearing skies and fresher air later in the day.
