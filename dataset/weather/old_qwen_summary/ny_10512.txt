Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, indicating a strong cold front moving through the city. Humidity levels steadily increased, peaking in the late night and early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation and potentially unstable atmospheric conditions. A dramatic spike in air pressure was recorded mid-day, followed by a sharp decline, which is characteristic of a passing low-pressure system associated with stormy weather. Wind speed and direction showed a sudden shift from a consistent westerly flow to strong easterly winds, indicating a change in circulation likely linked to the passage of the storm system. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from cooler, stable conditions to a period of instability, likely bringing precipitation and gusty winds in the immediate aftermath.
