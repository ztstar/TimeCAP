Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the afternoon and early evening before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed a pronounced decline during midday, dropping significantly and remaining low into the night, indicating a drying trend likely due to increased mixing and subsidence. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before declining slightly, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, implying a change in circulation patterns that may signal the approach of a boundary or a shift in air mass. Taken together, these indicators point to a transition toward clearer skies and more settled weather, with reduced chances of precipitation, though residual dryness may increase fire risk during the coming hours.
