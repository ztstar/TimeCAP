Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and possible fog formation or dew development. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day but began a noticeable drop in the late afternoon, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly associated with an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, particularly from the west and south, with sustained gusts and shifting directions indicating dynamic air movement and possible storm development. These combined factors point to a transition period in the weather, with rising instability and the potential for precipitation in the coming hours.
