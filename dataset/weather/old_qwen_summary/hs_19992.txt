Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, culminating in a sustained high-pressure phase, suggesting the arrival of stable, dry air that could lead to clearer skies later. Wind speeds were generally low and consistent, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, hinting at a change in air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime pattern toward potentially drier and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
