Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly during the midday, suggesting the influence of nocturnal dew point accumulation and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a gradual increase in the afternoon may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, which often brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a more dynamic, warming daytime regime—potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorm development if sufficient moisture and lift persist.
