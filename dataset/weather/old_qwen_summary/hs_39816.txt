Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels reached saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the formation of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility and created a damp, oppressive feeling in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a brief rise in the early morning may have signaled the influence of a weak high-pressure system, contributing to the clearing of overnight moisture. Wind speeds were lowest during the night and early morning, with a shift to moderate winds in the afternoon, driven by an increasing pressure gradient that likely facilitated the dispersion of moist air. Wind direction varied significantly, transitioning from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting the dynamic influence of regional synoptic patterns and the potential for localized convective development later in the day.
