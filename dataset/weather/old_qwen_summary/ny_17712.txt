Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of temperate climates. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before decreasing slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of nighttime moisture accumulation and possible fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak around midday before stabilizing, which is indicative of a high-pressure system influencing the region and promoting fair weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from westerly and southwesterly to more northerly and easterly directions, consistent with the approach of a stable high-pressure regime. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer skies and stable atmospheric conditions, likely resulting in comfortable daytime temperatures and minimal precipitation risk.
