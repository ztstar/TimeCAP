Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon and dropping significantly overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions before gradually declining during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, stabilizing at a high level, which points to the influence of a strong high-pressure system enhancing stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds diminished during the early morning hours, then intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, reflecting changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a clearer, drier afternoon, with potential for a resurgence of marine layer influence later in the day.
