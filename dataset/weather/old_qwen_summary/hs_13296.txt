Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, more unstable daytime air. Air pressure showed a gradual increase throughout the day, reaching a high in the afternoon and then slowly declining, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure ridge or an incoming weather system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable shift toward stronger and more variable winds in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and southwest quadrants, potentially indicating changing circulation patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests the end of a stable, cooler period and the onset of a warmer, more active weather regime, possibly setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
