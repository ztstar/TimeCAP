Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture content in the air, which can contribute to discomfort and potential for precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting no major storm systems are actively moving through the region. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a developing atmospheric instability, which could lead to thunderstorms later in the day.
