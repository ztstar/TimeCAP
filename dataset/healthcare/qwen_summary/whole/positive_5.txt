Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with positivity rates and absolute case counts rising sharply in recent months. Influenza A has consistently driven the increase in positivity, contributing disproportionately to the overall surge in cases, while Influenza B has also shown significant growth, particularly in the latter half of the period. The peak in positivity occurred during the most recent weeks, followed by a notable decline, suggesting the potential onset of a late-season plateau or early descent in transmission. The high positivity ratios indicate widespread community circulation, with testing yield reaching levels typical of a strong seasonal influenza wave. These trends underscore the urgent need for intensified public health interventions, including vaccination campaigns and clinical preparedness, to mitigate the impact on healthcare systems.
