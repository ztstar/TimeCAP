Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and remained high through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of moisture as air warmed and convection increased. Air pressure showed a notable spike during midday, reaching a peak just before the afternoon heat, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with shifting pressure gradients and possible frontal influence. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and changing wind patterns suggests an increasing likelihood of unstable air, potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
