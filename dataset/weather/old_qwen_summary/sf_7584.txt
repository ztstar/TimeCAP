Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping dramatically in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, culminating in a strong high-pressure buildup that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with minimal air movement. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to more easterly sectors reflects changing air mass influences, possibly signaling the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass after the overnight fog dissipation.
