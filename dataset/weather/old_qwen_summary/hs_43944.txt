Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels surged significantly in the overnight period, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation and increased discomfort during the night. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to stabilize, signaling possible approaching weather changes or a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable calm period around dawn, while wind direction shifted dramatically from northeasterly to southwesterly and back, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined trends—rising humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns—point to a high likelihood of unstable air and potential for thunderstorms later in the day or overnight.
