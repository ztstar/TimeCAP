Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a steady warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a consistent rise during the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts coming from the west and northwest, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or shift in air mass. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but increasing the risk of heat buildup during the day.
