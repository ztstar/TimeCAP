Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, followed by a sharp decline during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure fluctuated with a notable increase during the midday and evening, consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south, suggesting the development of localized convective activity or the influence of a passing front. Combined with shifts in wind direction and a drop in humidity, these trends point to a developing environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, requiring caution for residents in the area.
