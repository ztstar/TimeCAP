Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the possibility of fog or dew formation, particularly during the early hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a reduction in wind speed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind direction shifted from southeasterly to more variable and eventually westerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for instability. These conditions collectively point to an active weather transition, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers later in the day.
