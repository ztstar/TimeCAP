Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early night, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation, particularly around dawn. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late night and early morning, peaking before declining sharply, suggesting the passage of a strong high-pressure system followed by a developing low-pressure influence. Wind conditions were minimal during the peak fog period, with near-zero speeds and variable directions, allowing fog to persist and settle. The return of stronger, more consistent winds in the late afternoon, combined with a drop in humidity and pressure, signals a possible clearing trend, potentially bringing more stable and breezy conditions.
