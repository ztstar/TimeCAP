Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating and atmospheric stability. A significant spike in humidity occurred in the early morning, coinciding with a drop in temperature, suggesting possible fog formation or condensation, which may have reduced visibility during those hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, but a slight decline toward the end suggests the potential for changing conditions later. Wind patterns shifted from moderate southerly to more variable and stronger westerly and northerly flows in the late evening, with peak speeds observed in the final hours, which could signal the approach of a developing weather system. These combined factors—rising temperatures, decreasing pressure, and increasing wind—point to a transition in the local weather, potentially leading to unstable conditions, including possible precipitation or storm development overnight.
