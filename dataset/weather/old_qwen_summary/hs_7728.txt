Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, then declined sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of daytime heating and reduced moisture availability. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted notably around midday, with a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction, likely signaling the passage of a boundary or the influence of local circulation. These combined factors suggest that Houston transitioned from a humid, stable night into a drier, warmer, and more dynamic afternoon, with potential for developing convection later in the day.
