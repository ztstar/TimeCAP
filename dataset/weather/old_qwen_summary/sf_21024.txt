Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation (100%) during the night and early morning, indicating strong condensation potential and likely fog formation, which persisted through much of the early period. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, then stabilized, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system approaching the region. Wind speeds diminished to near-zero during the early hours, coinciding with the highest humidity and lowest temperatures, which contributed to dense fog and poor visibility. As the morning progressed, winds re-intensified and shifted toward the west-southwest, signaling a change in circulation that may bring clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
