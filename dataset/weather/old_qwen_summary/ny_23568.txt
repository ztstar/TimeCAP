Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a more dynamic daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture accumulation, likely linked to a change in air mass or dew point increase. A notable pressure increase occurred in the early morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions during the day. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating the influence of a developing pressure gradient and potential air movement from warmer regions. The return of higher humidity and a drop in wind speed toward the end of the period may suggest the onset of a weakening system or a return to more humid, less windy conditions, potentially increasing the chance of fog or drizzle in the near term.
