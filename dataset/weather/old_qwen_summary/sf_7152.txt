Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions influenced by marine air. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before decreasing during the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud formation that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but increased during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly and then back to southwest, indicative of changing local circulation patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds at night, and high humidity supports the likelihood of persistent fog or low clouds in the morning, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a cooler, more damp feel during early hours.
