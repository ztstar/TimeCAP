Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained low throughout the early and mid-day, then surged dramatically during the night, indicating the arrival of moist air, likely associated with marine influences. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the buildup of a high-pressure system that may be contributing to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief spikes during the late night and early morning, and wind directions shifted from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns near the coast. These trends point to a transition from dry, cool conditions to potentially foggy or overcast conditions in the coming hours, consistent with typical coastal microclimates in the region.
