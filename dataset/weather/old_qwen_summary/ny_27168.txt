Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a transition from stable to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely brought calm and clear skies. Wind speeds intensified overnight, peaked in the early hours, then diminished and shifted direction, reflecting a change in large-scale atmospheric flow. These combined trends point to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, leading to improving conditions with cooler nights and potentially sunny, dry days ahead.
