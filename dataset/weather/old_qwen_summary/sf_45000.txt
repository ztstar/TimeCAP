Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent maritime influence, likely contributing to the dry and stable air mass over the region. The unchanging humidity levels indicate a lack of moisture influx, which aligns with the absence of cloud development or precipitation. With steady wind speeds and pressure, the atmosphere has remained in a state of equilibrium, reducing the likelihood of sudden weather changes. This stability implies continued clear skies and mild conditions, typical of San Francisco’s persistent summer fog patterns, though the current dryness may limit fog formation.
