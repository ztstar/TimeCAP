Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend. Humidity spiked to saturation levels during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or light precipitation, which dissipated as temperatures climbed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system associated with stable and improving weather. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northwest to west directions, likely contributing to the dispersal of moisture and clearing skies. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a cool, damp, and windy night to a gradually warming and drier afternoon, pointing to improving conditions and clearer skies ahead.
