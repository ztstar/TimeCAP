Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by maritime conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before a significant drop, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures climbed. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, culminating in a peak just before midday, which likely signaled the passage of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and morning but intensified in the late afternoon, with a strong gust in the evening, possibly due to a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west, enhancing coastal mixing. The combination of rising temperature, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions, typical of a drying phase after a foggy or overcast period.
