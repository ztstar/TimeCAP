Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air mass, possibly from the southwest to the southeast. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern that could result in precipitation and cooler, more unstable conditions in the coming hours.
