The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has been remarkably stable, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent conditions suggest a prolonged period of atmospheric stagnation, likely under the influence of a persistent high-pressure system. Extremely low humidity levels indicate dry air, increasing the risk of fire weather, particularly if vegetation remains parched. Light, steady winds blowing from a southerly direction may contribute to the suppression of fog development, which is unusual for the region during certain times of year. Overall, the lack of change points to a quiet, dry, and stable weather regime, with minimal potential for precipitation or storm activity.
