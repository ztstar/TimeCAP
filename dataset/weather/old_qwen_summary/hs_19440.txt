Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cool, stable nocturnal period to a more energized daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, which suggests a possible shift in air mass or the onset of drier inflow. Air pressure exhibited a continuous decline, particularly after midday, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during most of the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon and evening, aligning with the movement of the low-pressure system. The wind direction shifted progressively from northeasterly to southeasterly and then to more southerly, consistent with the development of a moist, southerly flow that may support thunderstorm activity.
