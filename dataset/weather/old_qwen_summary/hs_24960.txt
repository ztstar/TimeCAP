Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking and remaining near saturation, which suggests the presence of a stable, moist air mass possibly associated with a nocturnal boundary layer. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before slightly declining in the late afternoon, pointing to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were initially moderate and consistent from the southwest, weakening significantly during the early morning hours before picking up again in the late afternoon from variable directions, possibly signaling a shift in local circulation. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and changing wind patterns indicates the potential for evening or overnight thunderstorm development, particularly as daytime heating resumes.
