Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the mid-afternoon before declining significantly overnight, indicating a strong nocturnal heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, reaching saturation at times, which contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel and increased the potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable surge in the late evening and early morning hours, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest a complex flow pattern possibly linked to local topography or a weak frontal influence. These combined factors point to a transition toward more stable, clearing conditions later in the day, with reduced chances of precipitation as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
