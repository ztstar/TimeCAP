Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined during the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooling overnight. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that likely contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, reaching a peak in the midday hours and remaining elevated, which typically signals improving weather and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief intensifications during the night and early morning, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from west to south and then to east, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime period to a drier, more stable day under a strengthening high-pressure regime, likely bringing clear skies and calm conditions in the near term.
