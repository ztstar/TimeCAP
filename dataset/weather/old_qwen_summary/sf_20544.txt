Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining during the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery toward the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, especially in the afternoon, with stronger gusts coming from the west-southwest, consistent with offshore flow patterns common in the region. These conditions together point to a marine layer influence, likely maintaining cool, damp weather and supporting the continuation of foggy, overcast conditions into the coming hours.
