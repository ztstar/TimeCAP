Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity remained consistently high, with near-saturation levels throughout most of the period, suggesting a strong potential for fog or mist formation, especially overnight. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and fair weather. Wind speeds increased steadily during the late night and early morning, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, hinting at possible moisture influx from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a more humid, stable, and potentially overcast or fog-prone morning, with the possibility of improving conditions later in the day.
