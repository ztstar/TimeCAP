Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, with conditions remaining saturated for over 12 consecutive hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog formation and persistent moisture. Temperature trends showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine layer cooling during nighttime and solar warming during daylight. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling a gradual shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions and potential clearing skies. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with direction shifting significantly from southwest to northeast and then back to the southeast, reflecting changing local wind patterns possibly influenced by topography and sea-breeze dynamics. These combined factors point to a typical coastal weather pattern: cool, foggy mornings transitioning into slightly clearer, milder afternoons, with a high chance of continued low-level cloud cover and cool temperatures into the near future.
