Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend with a return to milder conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that began to clear. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the afternoon, particularly from the west to northwest sectors, which may have contributed to the clearing of moisture. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, combined with rising pressure and decreasing humidity, points to a transition toward more settled and pleasant weather in New York City.
