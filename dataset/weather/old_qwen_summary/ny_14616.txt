Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the late hours before dropping during the day, suggesting moisture accumulation and possible fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, which often precedes storm systems or changing weather conditions, potentially signaling an approaching front. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a strong southerly surge that may have contributed to the influx of moist air. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition period in the weather, with the potential for increasing cloud cover and precipitation later in the day.
