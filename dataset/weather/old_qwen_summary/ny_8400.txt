Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the influence of a cold front that passed through overnight. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply as the atmosphere warmed, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure initially dropped sharply, reflecting the arrival of a low-pressure system, then stabilized at a relatively high level, signaling the system's departure and the onset of more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased during the night, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast by morning, consistent with the passage of a frontal boundary and the development of a more southerly flow. These changes collectively point to a transition from a cooler, damp, and windy period to clearer, drier, and milder conditions, likely improving visibility and comfort for city residents.
