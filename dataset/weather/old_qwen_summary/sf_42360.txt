Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near or at saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred, with calm conditions in the pre-dawn hours followed by increasing wind speeds and a change in direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, suggesting a change in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the end of the period, hinting at potential clearing skies or a weakening marine layer. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a more dynamic and potentially clearer atmosphere, which may influence visibility and outdoor conditions in the coming hours.
