Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical coastal diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, consistent with the formation of fog and low clouds common in the region during cooler periods. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has been maintaining calm and stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with brief but stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, potentially signaling the arrival of a shift in wind patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind direction points to the presence of a persistent marine layer, which may lead to foggy conditions and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
