Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity reached its peak during the overnight hours, particularly in the early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to overnight cooling and reduced air mixing. Air pressure exhibited a consistent decline in the latter half of the period, especially during the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly sectors, consistent with changing frontal dynamics. Combined, these trends suggest the arrival of a developing weather system that could result in precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
