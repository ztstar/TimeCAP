Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight and into the early morning, peaking during the night, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to overnight condensation and reduced air mixing. A notable increase in atmospheric pressure occurred in the mid-to-late morning, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the period, with a brief intensification in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, possibly indicating a change in air mass or local circulation. These combined patterns suggest a transition from humid, stable conditions to a slightly more dynamic environment, with potential for clearing skies and decreasing moisture as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
