Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming pattern through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the pre-dawn hours, remaining near saturation for several hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover. A notable increase in air pressure during the mid-to-late morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts, particularly in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing air mass dynamics. These conditions point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable environment, typical of the region's coastal weather patterns during the summer months.
