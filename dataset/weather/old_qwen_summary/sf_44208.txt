Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of near-saturation conditions, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, especially during the night and early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor drops in the late evening, suggesting a weak atmospheric disturbance, though not indicative of a major storm system. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest during the overnight and early morning, likely contributing to the fog formation and dissipation cycles. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind directions points to a persistent marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, which likely resulted in cool, foggy mornings and clearer, warmer afternoons.
