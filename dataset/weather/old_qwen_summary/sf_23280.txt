Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation and remaining near 100% for a prolonged period, indicating significant moisture accumulation and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a persistent and slow-moving weather system influencing the region. Wind speeds were consistently low, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest during the night, reinforcing the presence of a stable marine layer. Combined, these conditions point to a strong marine layer and fog-prone environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, which may persist into the coming day.
