Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced nighttime cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels showed a dramatic spike during the early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure rose sharply mid-morning and remained elevated, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly directions, with periods of calm and increased gusts, reflecting the complex interaction of marine layer dynamics and local topography. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, cool morning to a drier, more stable afternoon, consistent with typical coastal San Francisco weather patterns influenced by the Pacific marine layer.
