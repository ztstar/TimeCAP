Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a weak frontal boundary or atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more southeasterly, possibly indicating changing flow patterns associated with a developing low-pressure system. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind, and fluctuating pressure suggests the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms.
