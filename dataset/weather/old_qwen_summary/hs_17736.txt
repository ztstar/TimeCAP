Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures stabilizing at a lower level after an initial slight drop. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking near saturation, indicating a strong moist air mass over the region, which increases the likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished throughout the day, especially in the latter half, while wind direction shifted from southeast to predominantly west and northwest, signaling a change in air mass flow. These conditions point to a transition phase, where the region may be approaching a period of reduced storm activity, though lingering moisture could still support isolated showers or fog in the early morning hours.
