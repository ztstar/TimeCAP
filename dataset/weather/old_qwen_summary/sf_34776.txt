Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely due to nocturnal cooling and fog formation. A notable spike in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind activity remained generally light, with brief increases in the late night and early morning, primarily from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal breeze patterns. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy mornings and improving visibility later in the day.
