Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with near-saturation conditions in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, followed by a significant drying trend as temperatures rose. A steady drop in air pressure during the late evening and early morning hours, coupled with a slight rise later in the day, points to a passing low-pressure system that may have brought unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southeasterly sectors, consistent with a change in synoptic flow likely associated with the approaching system. These combined patterns suggest the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate ahead of the frontal boundary.
