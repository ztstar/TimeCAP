Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late afternoon, suggesting possible moist air advection followed by a brief dryout. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a developing frontal influence. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather regime, with the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term due to rising instability and converging air masses.
