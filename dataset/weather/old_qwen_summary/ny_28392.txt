Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cold, stable night into a milder daytime period. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during those hours. A sustained decline in air pressure, particularly through the night and early morning, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with the observed precipitation and overcast conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with strong gusts from the northeast, signaling active atmospheric instability and the potential for stormy weather. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly and then to easterly suggests an evolving frontal passage, likely bringing cooler, drier air behind the system, with implications for clearing skies later in the day.
