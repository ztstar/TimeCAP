Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp increase during the night and early morning, likely due to fog formation, particularly in the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure fluctuated, with a marked rise during mid-morning and late afternoon, suggesting the influence of shifting high-pressure systems, possibly associated with a ridge building offshore. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief bursts during specific periods, while wind direction shifted dramatically—especially in the early hours—indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to local topography and sea breeze dynamics. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a cool, foggy night to a clearer, milder daytime, with conditions conducive to the typical San Francisco microclimate of cool mornings and warmer afternoons.
