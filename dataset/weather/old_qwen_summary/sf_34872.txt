Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine layer fog as solar heating increased. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, signaling a possible weakening of a high-pressure system and potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a shift to more consistent light winds in the afternoon, accompanied by variable wind directions that suggest atmospheric instability. These conditions point to a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for clearer skies later in the day.
