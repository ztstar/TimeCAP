Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, reducing visibility and creating a damp, muggy feel. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring unstable conditions later. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southerly to southeasterly winds intensifying, potentially signaling the onset of a frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened risk of thunderstorm development in the coming hours.
