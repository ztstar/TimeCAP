Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the night, followed by a significant rebound in the afternoon, indicating strong diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours, spiked in the late night and early morning, then declined sharply during the day, suggesting dry air intrusion. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise, which may signal the passage of a weather front or a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased overnight, particularly during the pre-dawn hours, before subsiding to near calm conditions during midday, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, consistent with changing atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest a dynamic transition in Houston’s weather pattern, potentially indicating the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass after a period of fluctuating conditions.
