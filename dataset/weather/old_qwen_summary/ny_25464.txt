Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight cooldown. Humidity spiked to saturation levels during the early morning hours, likely due to cooling air near the dew point, followed by a sharp drop as temperatures rose, suggesting clearing skies and drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight downward trend in the evening, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more variable and stronger gusts from the south and southwest, possibly indicating a change in air mass or frontal influence. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable, drier conditions, potentially improving visibility and comfort for outdoor activities.
