Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature dropped significantly overnight, with the coolest readings occurring in the early morning hours, suggesting a strong radiative cooling effect followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, peaking during the night and early morning, which, combined with the falling pressure and increasing wind speeds, points to active atmospheric instability. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a stormy period, with potential for precipitation and gusty conditions in the near term.
