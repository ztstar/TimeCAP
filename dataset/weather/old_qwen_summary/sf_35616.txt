Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and elevated temperatures. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, fog-prone environment to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, signaling a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased during the early morning, then increased slightly in the afternoon before subsiding again, with wind direction shifting from a southerly to a more easterly flow, consistent with changing airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from coastal fog and marine influence toward a clearer, drier, and slightly warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
