Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds decreased substantially after midnight, with winds shifting from a prevailing northwest direction to more variable and weaker flows by midday, reducing coastal wind chill. The combination of decreasing wind, falling humidity, and rising pressure points to improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures in the near term.
