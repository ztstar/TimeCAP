Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moist air and possible fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and west, consistent with storm development. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind suggests a developing frontal system that may lead to precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
