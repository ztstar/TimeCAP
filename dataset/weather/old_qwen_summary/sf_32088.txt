Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and subsequent drying as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a shift in synoptic conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, consistent with the development of a coastal breeze pattern. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable environment, with potential for fog development during the night and improved conditions by midday.
