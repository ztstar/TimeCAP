Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, likely due to a persistent cold air mass. Humidity levels started high and gradually decreased, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting a drying trend that may reduce fog or precipitation risk. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds showed significant variability, with a notable surge toward the end of the period, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southwest to more west-southwest, indicating dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined factors suggest the city is transitioning into a drier, cooler, and more stable weather regime, favorable for clear skies and reduced chances of rain.
