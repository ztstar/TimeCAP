A significant temperature drop occurred during the early hours, followed by a sharp rebound in the midday, indicating a possible cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning, peaking in the late morning before declining, which may suggest moisture influx associated with the frontal system. Air pressure exhibited a strong fluctuation, with a rapid rise followed by a sustained high, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system. Wind patterns remained predominantly from the southwest with consistent speed, but a shift in direction during the night may have contributed to the temperature and humidity changes. Together, these indicators suggest a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the near term.
