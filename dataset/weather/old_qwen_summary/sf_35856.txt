Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent increase through the day, suggesting the influence of a stable high-pressure system that has helped maintain clear skies later in the day. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may signal a change in air mass or the onset of a coastal breeze pattern. These conditions suggest a transition from a cool, foggy morning to a more stable and mild afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
