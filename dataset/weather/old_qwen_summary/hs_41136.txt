Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds during the early hours, reducing visibility. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the midday and afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds remained generally moderate through most of the night and early morning but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating possible changes in air mass or the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for clearing skies later in the day if the high pressure continues to dominate.
