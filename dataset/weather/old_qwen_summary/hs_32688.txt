Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before showing a moderate decline, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more variable day, with conditions conducive to clearing skies and improving comfort during the upcoming hours.
