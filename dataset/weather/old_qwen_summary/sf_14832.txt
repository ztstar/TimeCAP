Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure rose sharply in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with consistent southerly to southwesterly winds, which may have transported marine air inland and enhanced fog formation. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and strong offshore winds points to a typical marine layer event, common in San Francisco during the summer months, resulting in cool, foggy conditions.
