Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A significant shift occurred in the afternoon, with humidity plummeting and wind speeds increasing, indicating the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass. Wind direction changes, particularly from southerly to northerly and then easterly, point to dynamic atmospheric adjustments, possibly associated with a passing front or coastal upwelling. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool maritime influence to a drier, warmer regime, potentially signaling improved visibility and clearer skies later in the day.
