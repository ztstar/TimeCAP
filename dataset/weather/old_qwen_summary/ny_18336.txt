Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with a notable cooling trend during the early hours. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before dropping, which suggests the presence of moisture accumulation followed by dispersion. Air pressure exhibited a marked drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front that may have brought transient instability. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, particularly from the south-southeast, then increased again in the afternoon, aligning with the movement of a low-pressure system and potential gusty conditions. Combined with shifting wind direction from southerly to westerly, these indicators suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, possibly leading to variable conditions such as brief showers or changing cloud cover in the coming hours.
