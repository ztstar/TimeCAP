Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely tied to marine influence. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising pattern, with a notable increase in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a pronounced lull in the late night and early morning, followed by stronger gusts in the evening, particularly from the south and southeast directions. These conditions point to a transition from a moist, cool maritime air mass to a drier, more stable regime, potentially leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
