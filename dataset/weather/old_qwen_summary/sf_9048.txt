Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in wind speed to near calm conditions occurred during the early morning, coinciding with the peak humidity, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions. As the day progressed, wind speeds increased again, and wind direction shifted from westerly to southeasterly, potentially signaling the arrival of a changing air mass or the influence of local topography. The fluctuating air pressure pattern, with a brief rise followed by a decline, hints at the passage of a weak weather system, though no strong frontal activity was evident.
