Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a sustained period of cold temperatures, with a gradual warming trend emerging in the final hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the early and middle part of the period, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a significant drop during the early-mid period, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely brought the initial cold and humid conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speed points to the arrival of a drier, potentially clearer air mass, which may improve conditions in the coming hours.
