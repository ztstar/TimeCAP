Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar insolation and a shift in wind patterns. Humidity levels showed a notable fluctuation, beginning high and dropping midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a complex interaction between air mass changes and local moisture dynamics. A gradual decline in atmospheric pressure was observed, peaking in the early morning and reaching a low point just before midnight, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger, more consistent flow from the south-southeast, potentially transporting warmer, moister air into the region. Combined, these indicators suggest a developing instability, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
