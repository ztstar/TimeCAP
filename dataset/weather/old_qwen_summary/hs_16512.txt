Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature during the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant warming trend that likely contributed to increasing atmospheric instability. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, stabilizing at a high level, which typically signals fair weather and the potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a consistent southerly to southeasterly flow that may have transported moisture inland, while shifts in wind direction toward the southeast in the later hours hint at a possible change in air mass influence. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests a shift toward warmer, drier, and potentially more unstable conditions, raising the likelihood of isolated afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
