Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to saturation near the surface. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the west to the southeast, potentially indicating a change in air mass or local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable nighttime environment to a gradually warming and drying trend, consistent with clearing skies and improving conditions by late evening.
