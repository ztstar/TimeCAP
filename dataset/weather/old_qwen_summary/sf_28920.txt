Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting fog formation, which later diminished during midday before returning to high levels in the evening, consistent with typical coastal fog cycles. Air pressure rose notably during the early morning, coinciding with the onset of fog and stable conditions, before stabilizing, reflecting a shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the day, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from northwesterly to southeasterly in the evening, indicating a change in air mass flow. These patterns collectively point to a classic marine layer event, with fog and cool, moist air dominating the coastal environment, potentially impacting visibility and morning commute conditions.
