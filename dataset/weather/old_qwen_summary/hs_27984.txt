Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nighttime cooling trend likely influenced by high humidity. Humidity levels remained persistently high, peaking in the late evening and early morning, which suggests a saturated air mass and increased potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable dip in the afternoon, followed by a sharp decline during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the southeast, consistent with a developing frontal boundary or storm system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly further supports the hypothesis of a low-pressure system influencing the region, raising the possibility of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
