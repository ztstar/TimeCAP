Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, then dropped sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition to drier, more stable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor decline in the late afternoon, hinting at a possible shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may signal the onset of an offshore flow. Together, these trends suggest the arrival of a maritime influence with cooling and drying effects, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
