Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, which likely contributed to the significant temperature drop. A sharp rise in wind speed and a shift to westerly and southerly wind directions around mid-morning point to the influence of a coastal breeze or frontal passage, potentially bringing in maritime air. Air pressure fluctuations were minimal but showed a slight increase during the afternoon, hinting at stabilization or the approach of a weak high-pressure system. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a cool, foggy overnight period to a clearer, warming afternoon, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
