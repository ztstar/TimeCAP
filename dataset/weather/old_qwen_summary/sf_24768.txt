Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a cyclical pattern, peaking during early morning hours and declining during midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure remained consistently high during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating stable conditions, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, particularly from a westerly to northwesterly direction, aligning with a strong onshore flow that likely contributed to the cooling and moisture influx. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the final hours points to a potential change in atmospheric circulation, possibly heralding a shift in weather patterns with implications for fog persistence and temperature trends.
