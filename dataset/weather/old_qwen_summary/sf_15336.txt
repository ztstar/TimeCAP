Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar radiation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which aligns with the formation of dense fog typical of the region’s maritime climate. A sharp increase in air pressure during the early morning suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more variable directions in the afternoon, with sustained winds from the south and west during peak fog conditions, reinforcing the influence of marine layer dynamics. Overall, the combination of cooling, high humidity, and stable pressure points to a classic coastal fog event that has since begun to dissipate, heralding a transition toward a drier and more stable afternoon.
