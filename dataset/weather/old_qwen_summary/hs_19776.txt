Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery as the day progressed, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests saturated air conditions conducive to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more westerly and northerly directions, potentially indicating a change in airflow associated with the advancing high-pressure ridge. These combined patterns point to a transition from humid, calm, and cool overnight conditions toward a more stable, windier, and potentially clearer day ahead.
