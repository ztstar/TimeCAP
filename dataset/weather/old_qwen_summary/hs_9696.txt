Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before steadily declining through the day, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure displayed a consistent upward trend through the morning and midday, stabilizing in the afternoon, which is often associated with fair weather and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained extremely low and uniform throughout the period, indicating minimal atmospheric mixing and potential for temperature inversions, especially during the cooler nighttime hours. The shift in wind direction from the northeast to a more easterly component at midday may signal a subtle change in air mass, possibly heralding a shift in weather patterns later in the day.
