Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the late morning, indicating a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds showed a marked increase during the early morning and late evening, with consistent easterly to southerly flow suggesting the influence of coastal dynamics and the prevailing onshore breeze pattern. The shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest in the final hours may indicate a change in airflow, potentially reflecting the onset of a new weather regime or a strengthening sea breeze.
