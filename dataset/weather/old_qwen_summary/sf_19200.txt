Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiation and changing wind patterns. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog formation, a common occurrence in the region during cooler nights. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a low point before slightly rebounding, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and afternoon, with strong, consistent southerly to westerly winds shifting to more easterly and northerly directions by evening, potentially indicating a change in the prevailing synoptic flow. These combined factors point to a transition period in the local weather, with increasing chances of fog, cooler conditions, and possibly precipitation if moisture continues to be advected into the region.
