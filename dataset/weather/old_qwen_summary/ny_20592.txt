Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, then sharply decreased midday before rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition in air mass. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the midday hours, coinciding with a change in wind direction and speed, indicating the approach of a weather system.
