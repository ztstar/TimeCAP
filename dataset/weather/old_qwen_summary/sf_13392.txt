Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before decreasing slightly during midday, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before a sudden drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night and morning, with a notable lull in the midday hours before increasing again in the late evening, possibly due to changing pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted significantly over the day, transitioning from a westerly to a southerly and then a northerly pattern, which, combined with the pressure drop, may indicate a developing low-pressure influence or shift in coastal airflow.
