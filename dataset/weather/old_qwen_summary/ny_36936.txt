Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a gradual回升, indicating a nighttime cooling trend followed by early morning warming. Humidity spiked to saturation levels during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the period, peaking in the mid-afternoon and maintaining a high value, signaling the influence of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning, shifting to lighter and more variable patterns later, with wind direction changing significantly around dawn, indicating a shift in airflow. Overall, the data suggests a stable, dry, and increasingly mild atmosphere, with clearing skies and favorable conditions for outdoor activities later in the day.
