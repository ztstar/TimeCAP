Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery during the day, indicating a cold front passage during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a notable decrease overnight, reaching a minimum just before sunrise, before rising sharply through the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that has likely stabilized the weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the west and northwest, likely driven by the pressure gradient associated with the passing front. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather shift—cold, humid conditions giving way to clearer, drier, and windier skies, which may influence travel, outdoor activities, and local air quality.
