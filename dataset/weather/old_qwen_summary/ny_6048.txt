Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a consistent cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before showing a slight rebound. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking near saturation in the late night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during those periods. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather, including possible precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities, particularly from the northeast and east sectors, suggesting a shift in airflow associated with the incoming system. Combined with sustained high humidity and falling pressure, these conditions point to a heightened chance of rain or overcast skies in the immediate forecast.
