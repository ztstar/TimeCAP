Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early afternoon before gradually declining into the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to a noticeable dampness and reduced comfort. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a minor drop toward the end, suggesting possible changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These conditions suggest the arrival of a more humid, potentially unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
