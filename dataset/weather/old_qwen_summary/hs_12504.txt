Temperature declined steadily through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before rising sharply in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant daytime heating. Humidity increased through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, then dropped during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a morning fog or low-level moisture layer that dissipated with solar heating. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or frontal influence. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing from late night into early morning, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from the west to the southeast. The change in wind direction and increasing wind speeds in the afternoon, combined with rising temperatures and decreasing humidity, point to the arrival of a drier, more unstable air mass, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
