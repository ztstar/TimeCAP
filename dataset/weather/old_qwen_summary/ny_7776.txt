Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, indicating a possible transition to drier conditions. A notable spike in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, particularly from the west-southwest, coinciding with a shift in wind direction that may signal a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest the end of a cooler, moist period and the onset of a drier, more stable, and potentially warmer phase in the city’s weather.
