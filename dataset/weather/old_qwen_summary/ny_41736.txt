Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely linked to a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure consistently declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which is characteristic of an approaching storm or frontal passage. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in direction from southeasterly to northerly during the night, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with the low-pressure development. These combined indicators suggest the city is transitioning into a period of unsettled weather, with potential for precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
