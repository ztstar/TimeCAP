Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant temperature fluctuation, with a notable drop in the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a possible cold front passage. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, remaining persistently high throughout the day, which suggests the presence of moist air likely associated with precipitation. A sharp increase in air pressure at dawn was followed by a return to stable, near-normal levels, signaling the passage of a weather system and the beginning of more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, particularly during the early hours, but increased slightly later in the day, with wind direction shifting from northwest to southeast, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined factors point to the aftermath of a storm system that brought rain and cooler temperatures, now giving way to clearer skies and milder conditions.
