Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning and remained extremely high through mid-morning, indicating potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual rise overnight, peaking in the late morning before declining slightly in the evening, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with a brief shift to stronger southerly winds in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a moist air mass. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests an increased likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or elevated humidity discomfort in the coming hours.
