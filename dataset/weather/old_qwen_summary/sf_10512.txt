Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the day warmed. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system, which is associated with clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speed remained nearly constant, but a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast occurred in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a change in local airflow patterns due to topography or synoptic influences. Overall, the data suggest a transition from cool, moist conditions to warmer, drier air, consistent with a clearing pattern likely driven by the inland push of maritime air.
