Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. A significant drop in humidity during mid-morning coincided with a rise in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from the south-southeast to the northeast, suggesting the influence of a coastal breeze or a passing weather front. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then declined in the late afternoon, signaling a potential shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. The persistence of low wind speeds and variable wind direction during the early and late hours indicates periods of atmospheric stagnation, which may contribute to localized fog formation or fog persistence, particularly near the coast. Overall, the data points to a dynamic but transitional weather pattern, with potential for clearer skies and improved air quality as the night progresses, provided the pressure continues to stabilize.
