- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in testing volume, suggesting increasing respiratory activity or heightened surveillance. A notable acceleration in growth is observed in the final seven weeks, indicating a potential surge in influenza circulation or expanded testing capacity. This pattern implies heightened public health concern and warrants preparedness for increased demand on healthcare resources.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The data reveals a steep and sustained upward trajectory in influenza A positivity, with a dramatic acceleration in the final eight weeks, indicating a rapidly intensifying respiratory virus spread. The transition from moderate levels to a sharp surge suggests the onset of a significant influenza wave, likely driven by high transmissibility and widespread community circulation. This trend underscores an urgent need for heightened public health surveillance, increased healthcare preparedness, and targeted interventions to mitigate potential strain on medical systems.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend, with a marked increase in activity beginning in the middle of the observation period, suggesting the onset of a robust influenza season. A significant spike in values during the final weeks indicates a peak in influenza B circulation, far exceeding earlier levels and signaling intense community transmission. This sharp rise, particularly in the most recent weeks, underscores an urgent need for heightened surveillance, public health preparedness, and potential interventions to mitigate further spread.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator has shown a consistent and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable shift from moderate levels to a steep increase beginning in week 15. The most significant acceleration occurred in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapid surge in influenza activity, which may indicate the onset of a peak phase in the respiratory virus season. This pattern implies heightened transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting urgent public health surveillance and intervention planning.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a pronounced increase beginning in week 11, signaling a significant surge in influenza A positivity. The rate of growth intensified sharply in the final weeks, suggesting a rapid progression toward peak seasonal activity, potentially indicating widespread community transmission. This pattern aligns with typical influenza season dynamics but at an accelerated pace, which may strain healthcare resources and underscore the urgency for heightened surveillance and public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator has shown a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in growth during the final quarter of the period, indicating a significant increase in influenza B positivity rates. A notable inflection point occurred around week 15, where the rate began rising sharply, suggesting the onset of a growing epidemic wave. This trend, particularly the steep climb in recent weeks, raises concerns about heightened community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources.
