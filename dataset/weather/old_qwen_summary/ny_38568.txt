Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating a period of high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A sustained drop in atmospheric pressure, particularly from midday onward, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring precipitation or stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with a developing frontal boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these indicators point to an active weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
