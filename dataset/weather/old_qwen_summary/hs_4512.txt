Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the quiet wind period. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, coinciding with the onset of increased wind activity and shifting wind direction, signaling a possible change in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger, consistent winds from the southeast, potentially bringing in moisture and influencing local storm development. The combination of rising temperatures, lingering high humidity, and persistent wind from the southeast raises the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
