Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the afternoon and early evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar exposure and potentially changing air mass dynamics. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning hours, suggesting moist air availability, which then sharply declined in the midday and afternoon, pointing to a drying trend likely driven by warming and wind shifts. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate with a consistent direction shift from the southwest to the west-southwest, indicating a change in upper-level flow that may have contributed to the warming and drying. Taken together, these trends suggest the end of a potentially damp and cool period, with improving conditions and a transition toward drier, more stable weather in the coming hours.
