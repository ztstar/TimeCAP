Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon before rebounding late at night, indicating the presence of a shifting fog layer and potential coastal upwelling. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the midday and evening, reaching a high before declining slightly, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure ridge or the influence of a developing sea breeze. Wind speeds were notably variable, with strong gusts in the early evening and late night, driven by changing pressure gradients and localized topographic effects, particularly from the west and northwest. Combined, these patterns suggest a complex interplay between maritime influences, thermal gradients, and regional wind shifts, likely contributing to persistent fog, cool temperatures, and unstable conditions favorable for late-night showers.
