Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of moist marine air and potential fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and calm conditions. Wind speeds declined sharply overnight, reaching near-zero values in the pre-dawn hours, which further supported the development of fog and reduced mixing in the lower atmosphere. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly sectors late in the cycle may signal a change in airflow patterns, possibly hinting at an approaching weather shift.
