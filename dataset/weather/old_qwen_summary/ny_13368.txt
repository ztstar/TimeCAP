Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that has brought more stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, which may signal a shift in airflow associated with the high-pressure influence. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and light to moderate winds points to improving weather conditions, likely leading to a dry and pleasant day ahead.
