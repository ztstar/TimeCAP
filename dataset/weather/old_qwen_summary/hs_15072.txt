Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend toward morning. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more variable one. Air pressure showed a sharp decline in the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased humidity and reduced wind speeds. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night, increasing slightly in the late morning and early evening, with wind direction shifting from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, possibly indicating changing airflow patterns associated with the passing system. Taken together, these trends suggest a dynamic weather shift, with potential for increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term as the system evolves.
