Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with a storm front. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking just before a sharp decline in the midday hours, suggesting a transition to drier air following precipitation. Temperature trends reflect a cold nighttime period with minimal warming until midday, followed by a gradual rise, consistent with the arrival of a more stable air mass. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest, pointing to changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest a recent storm passage, with potential for lingering instability and variable conditions in the immediate hours ahead.
