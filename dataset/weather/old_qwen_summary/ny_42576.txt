Over the past 24 hours, a gradual cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining overnight, suggesting the influence of a cooling air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, particularly during the early morning and late evening, indicating intermittent changes in moisture availability, possibly tied to shifting wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined, especially in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift from variable to more consistent southerly and westerly directions, which may enhance moisture transport. Together, these trends point to a developing weather transition, with potential for increased cloud cover and precipitation in the near term.
