Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the influence of a dry air mass moving in. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining rapidly, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast, indicating changing atmospheric circulation. These patterns collectively point to the dissipation of a cold front and the establishment of a more stable, drier, and slightly warmer regime, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
