- Humidity (%): Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the initial and middle portion of the 24-hour period, indicating saturated atmospheric conditions that may have contributed to fog or reduced visibility. A sharp decline occurred in the latter half, with values dropping significantly and reaching notably low levels before recovering slightly, suggesting a possible weather front passage or change in air mass. This abrupt shift implies dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially signaling the onset of drier conditions or a shift in wind patterns affecting local humidity.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a stable baseline for most of the past 24 hours, indicating settled atmospheric conditions. A notable drop occurred in the latter part of the period, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring changing weather, including precipitation. The subsequent slight recovery implies possible stabilization or the passage of a front, warranting monitoring for potential storm development.
- Temperature (Kelvin): Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, reaching a trough before gradually rebounding through the late morning and afternoon. A notable dip occurred mid-cycle, followed by a pronounced recovery, suggesting a significant thermal shift likely tied to diurnal patterns or atmospheric changes. The subsequent stabilization and slight cooling toward the end indicate a return to equilibrium, consistent with typical urban heat dynamics in New York City.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a stable baseline for the first 12 hours before increasing steadily, peaking in the latter half of the period. A notable drop to near-zero values occurred around the 16th hour, followed by a rapid recovery and sustained higher speeds, indicating a possible transient atmospheric disturbance. The fluctuation pattern suggests a shift in local wind dynamics, potentially linked to evolving weather systems, which may influence short-term conditions such as air quality and outdoor activity safety.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Over the past 24 hours, wind direction exhibited a consistent shift from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly, indicating a significant rotational pattern likely associated with a passing weather system. A notable reversal occurred around the 18th hour, transitioning from a prevailing westerly flow to a strong easterly component, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure feature. The final values returning to near-eastern direction may point to the system’s exit or a change in pressure gradient, with potential implications for local wind conditions and air quality dispersion.
