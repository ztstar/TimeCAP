Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal cooling event and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels showed a dramatic fluctuation, peaking during the night and early morning, then plummeting during midday before rising again in the evening—indicative of a passing frontal system or localized convective activity. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, which could suggest a change in atmospheric flow associated with the high-pressure influence. Overall, these indicators point to dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day, including possible thunderstorms if sufficient moisture returns.
