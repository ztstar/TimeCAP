Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City dropped significantly, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong cooling trend likely driven by frontal passage or nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking near dawn, which suggests moisture accumulation and the potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night, reaching a low point before gradually rebounding, consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, accompanied by variable but predominantly easterly and southerly winds, indicating active atmospheric instability. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and gusty winds—point to a transition toward unsettled weather, possibly bringing precipitation or overcast conditions in the near term.
