Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating a saturated atmosphere likely linked to the presence of fog or light precipitation, which then decreased significantly as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late night hours, with consistent easterly to northerly winds suggesting a frontal influence or cold air advection. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and weakening winds suggests improving weather conditions and the potential for a dry, cooler day ahead.
