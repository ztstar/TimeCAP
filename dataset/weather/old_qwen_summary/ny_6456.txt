Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a damp and oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely brought the observed precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southeasterly to easterly winds developing, suggesting the influence of a developing storm system. The shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, combined with falling pressure and rising temperatures, points to a frontal passage that may lead to ongoing unsettled weather conditions.
