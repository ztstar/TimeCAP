Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog and the arrival of drier air. A significant pressure spike occurred around midday, followed by a gradual decline, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential onset of changing weather patterns. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late evening, particularly from the northwest and later the southeast, which may indicate shifting wind patterns due to evolving pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a transition from cool, foggy conditions to warmer, drier, and more variable winds, consistent with typical afternoon katabatic and onshore wind patterns in the region.
