Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the overnight hours, indicating saturated air conditions likely associated with fog or light precipitation, followed by a marked drop in the late morning and afternoon. Air pressure rose steadily through the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from westerly to southerly directions, consistent with a developing frontal boundary. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the potential for showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
