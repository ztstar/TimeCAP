Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual decrease, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, stabilizing at a higher level by late evening, which typically signals improving weather and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable reduction in the early morning and a slight increase in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted consistently from southerly to southwesterly, indicating a stable high-pressure influence. Collectively, these trends suggest a period of stable, dry, and mild conditions developing across Houston, with decreasing chances of precipitation and improving visibility as the system consolidates.
