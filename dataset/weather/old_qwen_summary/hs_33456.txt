Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warmer daytime regime. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and potential for fog or drizzle, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south-southwest, possibly signaling the onset of a shift in air mass. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests a transition toward a drier, more stable, and potentially breezy afternoon to evening pattern.
