Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture—especially during the night and early morning—suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of the city’s coastal climate. A sharp decline in air pressure occurred in the early afternoon, accompanied by strong winds, pointing to the influence of a passing weather system, likely a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased substantially during this period, with gusts from the southwest to west, consistent with onshore flow that often brings coastal fog and cooler conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the south and east in the late evening may signal the beginning of a change in air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and a return to more stable conditions.
