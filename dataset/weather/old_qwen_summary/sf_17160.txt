Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the day, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting the absence of strong weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, hinting at changing local airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a developing marine layer influence, likely contributing to fog formation overnight and potentially affecting visibility and temperature inversion in the coming hours.
