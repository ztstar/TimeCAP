Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking in the overnight period before steadily declining, indicating a significant nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to a passing weather system. Air pressure showed a complex pattern with a pronounced increase during midday, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought clearer skies and stable conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with consistent southerly to southwesterly winds throughout the night and early morning, shifting slightly toward the west-southwest later, which may reflect changing frontal dynamics. The combination of high humidity overnight, rising pressure, and steady wind direction suggests the dissipation of a low-pressure or storm system, leading to improving conditions and a return to more typical springtime warmth.
