Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dew and a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring further unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the east-southeast, potentially enhancing moisture advection and supporting storm development. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly indicates a changing air mass, consistent with the onset of a potential weather disturbance in the region.
