Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown, with temperatures declining through the night and remaining near their lowest point in the early morning hours before a slight recovery. Humidity reached and maintained near saturation levels during the late night and early morning, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s marine layer. A consistent drop in air pressure through the night suggests the approach or passage of a low-pressure system, which aligns with the persistent fog and overcast conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly directions, reflecting changing flow dynamics associated with the atmospheric disturbance. These conditions collectively point to a prolonged marine layer event, likely contributing to cool, damp, and overcast weather across the region.
