Temperatures remained consistently low during the early and middle hours of the period before gradually rising, indicating a stabilization and subsequent warming trend. Humidity levels were elevated in the early hours but dropped significantly during midday, only to spike again toward the end, suggesting a possible moisture influx. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a sharp rise in the final hours, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds remained steady but slightly increased later in the period, and wind direction shifted gradually from west-northwest to north-northwest, aligning with the progression of the high-pressure system. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from cold, damp conditions to drier, more stable weather, likely bringing clearer skies and improved conditions for the remainder of the day.
