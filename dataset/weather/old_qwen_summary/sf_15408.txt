Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before steadily declining through the night and into the early hours of the next day. A significant rise in humidity occurred during the overnight hours, coinciding with a sharp drop in temperature, indicating the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility. Wind speeds were generally low during the early and late hours, but increased substantially in the early afternoon, likely due to a shift in local wind patterns associated with a passing pressure system. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, particularly toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring further changes in weather. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly suggests complex local circulation changes, possibly influenced by the Bay Area’s topography and coastal dynamics.
