Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night before gradually rising in the morning. A notable spike in humidity occurred during the early morning hours, coinciding with a rise in air pressure, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that brought stable, dry air later in the day. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a northwest to west-northwest direction, indicating a shift in atmospheric flow that may have contributed to the cooling. The sustained high pressure and decreasing humidity in the latter half of the period point to improving conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and drier air. These trends collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, followed by a period of stable, cooler, and less humid weather.
