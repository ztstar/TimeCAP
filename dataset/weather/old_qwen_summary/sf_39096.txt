Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating no major weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns suggests a continued influence of coastal maritime conditions, which may lead to lingering fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
