Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a warming trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, with a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing of moisture and a shift toward drier air. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the late afternoon and evening, peaking before declining slightly, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased substantially during the midday and afternoon, with stronger gusts originating from varied directions, including a marked shift toward the west and northwest in the late afternoon. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather pattern, likely associated with the passage of a front, which could lead to unstable conditions or the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
