Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the late evening, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure increased notably in the afternoon and early evening, peaking before a sharp drop, which may signal the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds decreased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with winds shifting from a northerly to a more southerly direction by late evening, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined indicators suggest the city transitioned from a cold, moist, and stable air mass to a more unstable and potentially storm-prone environment.
