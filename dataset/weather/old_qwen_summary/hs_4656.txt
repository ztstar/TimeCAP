Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning before gradually rising again by midday. Humidity levels surged dramatically after midnight, peaking and remaining near saturation through the early morning, which likely contributed to a noticeable dew point and reduced comfort levels. A distinct wind shift occurred in the late morning, with calm conditions giving way to strengthening southerly winds, indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, consistent with the approach of a weather front. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind speeds suggests an elevated risk of thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
