Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal pattern typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels remained high in the early hours, sharply dropping during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a shift from marine influence to drier inland air. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the late afternoon, peaking in the evening, which is indicative of a high-pressure system moving in, likely leading to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and southwest, signaling the arrival of a more dynamic air mass potentially linked to offshore flow. The overall pattern suggests a transition from cool, moist coastal air to drier, more variable conditions, with the potential for improved visibility and reduced fog as the high-pressure system consolidates.
