Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, beginning relatively high and dropping sharply during the midday peak, suggesting a drying phase that may have been influenced by wind movement and air mass changes. Air pressure declined steadily through the early morning hours, reaching a low point before rising slightly, which points to the passage of a low-pressure system followed by a developing high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, with stronger gusts from the west-southwest, indicating a shift in prevailing winds that could signal approaching weather changes. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day, though lingering instability remains possible.
