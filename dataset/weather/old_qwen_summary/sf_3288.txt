Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of coastal fog events in the region. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a stabilizing high-pressure system that likely contributed to the calming of wind conditions and the suppression of precipitation. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with periods of complete calm, but increased slightly in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast, potentially signaling a shift in local wind patterns due to diurnal heating. The combination of high humidity, low wind, and a stable pressure regime points to a high likelihood of persistent marine layer conditions, which may lead to foggy mornings and mild, overcast afternoons in the coming hours.
