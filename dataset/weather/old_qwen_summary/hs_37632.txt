Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning, indicating a strong nocturnal radiative loss. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the evening and overnight hours, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, creating conditions ripe for fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the early morning and suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased notably in the late morning and afternoon, with gusts from the northeast and southeast, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly suggests the approach of a frontal boundary, which could lead to unsettled weather later in the day.
