Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend throughout the day, indicating a transition from a cold night to a milder afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight period, particularly in the early hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, which later decreased as the day progressed and skies cleared. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with multiple sharp increases and decreases, most notably a sustained high-pressure system during midday followed by a sudden drop, signaling a possible frontal passage. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with notable gusts, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These combined factors suggest the arrival of a dynamic weather front, potentially bringing precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
