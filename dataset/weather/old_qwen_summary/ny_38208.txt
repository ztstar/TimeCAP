Over the past 24 hours, temperature gradually increased, indicating a warming trend from early morning through the afternoon, suggesting the onset of a more stable and milder period. Humidity levels showed a marked rise during the early hours, peaking in the night and early morning before declining, which may have contributed to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, reaching a sustained high, a strong indicator of improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were initially moderate, with a notable increase in the late night and early morning, followed by a period of relative calm and then a gradual resurgence, suggesting shifting wind patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. Wind direction shifted significantly from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, indicating a complex circulation pattern that likely influenced the movement of air masses and local weather conditions.
