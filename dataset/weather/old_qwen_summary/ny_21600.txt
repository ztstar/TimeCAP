Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that began during the night and continued into the afternoon. Humidity remained near saturation for most of the period, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during early morning hours when the temperature was lowest. Air pressure steadily declined, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unstable weather and potential precipitation. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to more westerly, consistent with the inflow of moist air ahead of a frontal system. These combined factors point to a significant weather change, with elevated chances of rain or showers in the near term.
