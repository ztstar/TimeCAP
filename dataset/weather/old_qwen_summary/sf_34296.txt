Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of nocturnal fog or increased moisture in the air, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the midday and afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and onshore flow patterns. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the late afternoon may signal a transition in airflow, potentially affecting visibility and contributing to the dissipation of fog as the day progressed.
