Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred through the night and early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable weather and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly and then to northerly, suggesting a change in air mass, possibly bringing drier conditions. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable winds indicates a period of atmospheric instability, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
