Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low until late evening, when they increased noticeably, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment toward a more dynamic, warmer, and potentially less humid daytime regime, consistent with a developing high-pressure ridge over the region.
