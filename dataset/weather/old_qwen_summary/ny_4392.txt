Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery, indicating a significant overnight cooling event. Humidity levels showed a sharp drop during the late night and early morning, followed by a modest increase in the late morning, suggesting a dry air mass prevailed overnight. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the evening and into the early morning, peaking before a slight decline, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, particularly in the early hours, with strong gusts originating from the northwest and west, indicating active atmospheric dynamics. The shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest later in the day, combined with rising pressure and dropping temperatures, points to a cold front passing through, likely bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the near term.
