Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature swing, with a significant cooling trend during the night followed by a steady warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic contrast, dropping sharply during midday before rising again in the evening, suggesting a mix of dry inland air and evening moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, but a notable drop occurred in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in weather systems. Wind patterns were highly variable, with strong, shifting winds during the day giving way to calm conditions overnight, followed by renewed gusts in the early morning hours. These combined indicators point to a dynamic transition, likely driven by coastal upwelling and changing synoptic conditions, which could lead to increasing cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
