Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near-saturation levels before dropping abruptly in the late morning, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible precipitation event. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a sharp decline later in the day, which may signal the passage of a weather front or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low and variable throughout most of the day, with a sustained increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing circulation patterns. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions, including the possibility of thunderstorms later in the day.
