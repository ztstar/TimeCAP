Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating a transition from stable to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with minor fluctuations that suggest a persistent, albeit slightly shifting, high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were consistently low, with calm periods and light, variable winds, which likely contributed to the accumulation of moisture near the surface during the night. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest in the latter half of the period may signal a subtle change in air mass, potentially hinting at an approaching maritime influence or a shift in coastal flow dynamics.
