Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels reached saturation during the overnight period and remained extremely high, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which contributed to foggy conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early afternoon, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished during the evening and remained light, with wind direction shifting from northwest to nearly north-northeast, consistent with a transition into a more stable air mass. These combined trends point to the aftermath of a cold front, with clearing skies expected as the high-pressure system consolidates, improving visibility and comfort in the coming hours.
