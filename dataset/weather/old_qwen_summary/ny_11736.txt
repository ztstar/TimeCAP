Temperatures steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before stabilizing, indicating a prolonged cold trend. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and overnight, with gusts from the north and northeast, likely contributing to the cooling effect and possible wind chill. Combined, these patterns suggest a cold, damp, and potentially windy night with improving conditions expected as high pressure consolidates.
