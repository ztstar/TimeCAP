Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. A significant shift occurred around midday, when humidity levels plummeted sharply, indicating a drying trend likely due to a change in air mass or the arrival of a high-pressure system. This was accompanied by a substantial increase in air pressure, suggesting the influence of a stable high-pressure ridge that suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently low except for a brief spike, with wind direction shifting abruptly from a northwesterly to a southerly flow, which may have contributed to the warming and drying conditions. These combined factors point to the onset of a dry, stable period, potentially reducing the likelihood of fog or rain in the near term.
