Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming period as the day progressed, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight and early morning hours, peaking during the night, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure declined steadily throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to stronger, more consistent easterly to southeasterly winds, possibly indicating the influence of a developing frontal system. Combined with the drop in pressure and rising humidity, these wind changes suggest the onset of a stormy or rainy period in the coming hours.
