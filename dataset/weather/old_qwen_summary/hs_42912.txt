Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late evening and early morning, peaking in the early hours, indicating increasing moisture content in the air. Air pressure showed a sustained rise through the middle of the day, followed by a modest decline in the late evening, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified notably in the early morning hours, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These combined factors suggest the approach of a frontal boundary, potentially leading to unstable conditions and the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
