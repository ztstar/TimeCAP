Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to their lowest during the early morning hours before gradually rising. A marked increase in humidity occurred during the night, reaching saturation levels, which coincided with a sharp rise in wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the southwesterly to the northeasterly quadrant, suggesting the influence of a coastal front. The wind pattern showed a strong surge in the late evening, peaking just before dawn, followed by a return to light and variable winds during the day. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the night, followed by a recovery and a subsequent rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and its subsequent clearing. These conditions suggest an active marine layer event, likely contributing to fog formation and coastal cooling, with potential implications for visibility and morning commute conditions.
