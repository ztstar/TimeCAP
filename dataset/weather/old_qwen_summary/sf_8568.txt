Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure showed multiple fluctuations, with notable increases correlating with periods of stronger wind and shifts in wind direction from offshore to onshore, suggesting the influence of changing synoptic conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, particularly from the south and southeast, likely driven by a coastal breeze or pressure gradient shift. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern, with potential for foggy mornings and improving conditions in the afternoon, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
