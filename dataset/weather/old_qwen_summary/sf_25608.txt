Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the midday, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, sustained winds from the west-southwest, consistent with coastal gap flow dynamics typical of the region. These combined factors point to a shift from a cool, foggy morning to a warmer, windier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal coastal weather patterns.
