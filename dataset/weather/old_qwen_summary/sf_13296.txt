Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the overnight hours, indicating elevated moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to a damp and foggy atmosphere. A significant increase in wind speed occurred in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, suggesting the influence of a coastal breeze or atmospheric front. Air pressure remained elevated through most of the night, then dropped sharply in the late morning, signaling a possible approaching weather system or change in atmospheric conditions. These combined factors point to a dynamic transition period, with coastal fog and cooler conditions prevailing, potentially impacting visibility and outdoor activities.
