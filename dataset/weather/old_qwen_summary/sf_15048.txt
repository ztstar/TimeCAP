Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, particularly in the early hours when temperatures were lowest. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions, though a sudden drop later in the morning signaled a change in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, consistent winds originating from the southwest, which may indicate a shift in regional airflow. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and wind shifts suggests a high likelihood of fog persistence into the early hours of the next day, particularly near coastal and low-lying areas.
