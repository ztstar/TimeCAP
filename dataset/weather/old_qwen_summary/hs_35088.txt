Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of a nocturnal moisture layer. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing and slightly rising in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from the east-northeast to the southeast and eventually to the east-southeast, hinting at a change in regional airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a stable, moist nighttime environment to a drier, warmer, and more dynamic daytime regime, potentially increasing the risk of heat stress and affecting local air quality and comfort levels.
