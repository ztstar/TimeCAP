Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely due to clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained high through the early hours, then sharply decreased during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a transition from marine layer dominance to a drier, more stable air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low before stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a weather system or the influence of coastal dynamics. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west and southwest, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the approaching system. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly suggests changing airflow patterns typical of coastal upwelling and synoptic adjustments, influencing both temperature and humidity trends.
