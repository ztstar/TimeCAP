Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with shifts in wind direction pointing to changing flow patterns, possibly related to a developing frontal boundary. Combined, these indicators suggest an increased likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or showers as the day progresses, especially if the low-pressure influence strengthens.
