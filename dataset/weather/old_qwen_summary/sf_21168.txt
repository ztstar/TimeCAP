Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a shift in thermal dynamics likely influenced by atmospheric changes. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests prolonged moisture presence and a strong likelihood of fog formation or persistent low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a slight uptick in the late afternoon, and wind direction consistently shifted from west-northwest to west-southwest, reflecting a stable synoptic pattern typical of coastal inversions. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer, common in San Francisco’s microclimate, which may continue to suppress temperatures and maintain overcast or foggy conditions through the day.
