Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly overnight and in the early morning, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to fog formation. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend through the morning, stabilizing in the mid-to-upper range, indicating stable atmospheric conditions with no immediate storm development. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases during late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, suggesting shifting local flow patterns influenced by topography. Overall, the conditions point to a typical coastal fog pattern, likely driven by nocturnal cooling and marine air intrusion, which may persist into the coming morning.
