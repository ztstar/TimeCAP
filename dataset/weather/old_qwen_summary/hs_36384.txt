Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling front that moved through the region overnight. Humidity levels spiked to saturation during the early hours, remaining near maximum for much of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed a steady increase overnight, peaking in the late morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, pointing to a change in airflow that may have facilitated the influx of warmer, moister air. Overall, the combination of high humidity, fluctuating wind patterns, and a transitioning pressure system suggests a period of atmospheric instability, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later today.
