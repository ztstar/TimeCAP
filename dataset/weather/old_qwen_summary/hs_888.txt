Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of nocturnal fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure gradually increased through the day, stabilizing at a higher level by late afternoon, which is often associated with improving weather conditions and fair skies. Wind activity remained minimal overnight, with only brief gusts observed during the late morning and early evening, including a shift to a southerly direction that may signal an approaching influence from the Gulf. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a warm, dry day, with low risk of precipitation but potential for elevated heat stress as temperatures rise.
