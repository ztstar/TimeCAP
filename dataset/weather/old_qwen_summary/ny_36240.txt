Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual recovery toward morning, indicating a pronounced cooling trend likely associated with a passing cold front. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, particularly in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which may have contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours, a clear sign of an approaching weather system, possibly a storm or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with sustained strong gusts from the west to northwest, consistent with dynamic atmospheric conditions accompanying the low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest in the late morning suggests a change in airflow, potentially signaling the start of a transition in weather patterns, with implications for future precipitation and temperature stability.
