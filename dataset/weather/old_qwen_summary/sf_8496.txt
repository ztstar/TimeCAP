Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely contributing to fog formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early hours, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly directions during the night, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, potentially enhancing coastal fog dispersion. Overall, the combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and strong winds points to a period of maritime influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with possible fog and cool conditions persisting into the coming day.
