Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a consistent cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning and remained elevated through the late night and early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, with the most pronounced drop occurring in the late night and early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with the inflow of moist air ahead of the approaching system. These combined factors point to a developing unstable atmospheric environment, raising the likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
