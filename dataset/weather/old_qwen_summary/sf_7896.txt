Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout, peaking near saturation during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region’s marine layer. Air pressure rose significantly during the early morning, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low and steady until late evening, when they increased slightly, likely due to a shift in local circulation patterns. The wind direction showed a consistent shift from the southwest to the west and northwest, aligning with typical coastal flow and suggesting the influence of a strengthening offshore breeze that may help disperse fog and stabilize the atmosphere.
