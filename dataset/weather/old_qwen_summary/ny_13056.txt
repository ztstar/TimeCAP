Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, likely due to an approaching cold front. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure dropped significantly during the middle of the period, stabilizing at low levels, which is characteristic of an active weather system bringing unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly, especially in the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching strong levels, and wind direction shifted frequently, indicating turbulent airflow associated with storm development. These combined factors point to the presence of a low-pressure system influencing the region, potentially leading to precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
