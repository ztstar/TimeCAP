Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual increase, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels showed a significant spike in the late evening and early morning, followed by a sharp drop, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air, possibly due to a passing front. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight hours, particularly in the early morning, with gusts from the northwest and west, indicating strong surface-level air movement associated with a developing high-pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and then back to the west suggests a complex interaction of air masses, with potential for changing weather patterns later in the day.
