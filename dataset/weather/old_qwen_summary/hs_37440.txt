Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature rise, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and increasing atmospheric stability. Humidity levels surged significantly in the late evening and overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moisture accumulation and the potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the pre-dawn hours, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, consistent with a developing frontal influence or convective activity. These combined factors point to a transition toward more unstable and potentially storm-prone weather in the near term, especially as moisture and lift continue to build.
