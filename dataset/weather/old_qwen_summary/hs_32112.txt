Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the influence of daytime heating and potential high-pressure dominance. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, which is consistent with the approach of a strengthening high-pressure system, contributing to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening, particularly from the southwest and south, with sustained gusts likely due to shifting pressure gradients and local terrain effects. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and strengthening winds points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, though localized convection remains possible during peak heating.
