Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing or air mass shift. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by changing wind directions that suggest a shift in local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for improving conditions later in the day.
