Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to condensation or fog formation. A marked decrease in air pressure occurred during the night, followed by a sharp rebound, which is often associated with the passage of a weather front, potentially signaling a shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a pronounced shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating a change in air mass and possible inflow of moist, unstable air. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
