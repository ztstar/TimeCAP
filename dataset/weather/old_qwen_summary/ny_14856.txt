Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have brought unstable weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief increase during the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, signaling changing air masses. The combination of high humidity, dropping pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a transition period that could lead to precipitation or overcast conditions later in the day.
