Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with a significant spike in the early morning hours, suggesting possible fog formation or marine layer activity, which then stabilized during the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a noticeable drop in the late evening and early morning, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly associated with an approaching frontal system. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases during the early morning and late afternoon, and wind directions shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and easterly, indicating changing flow patterns possibly due to local topography and pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the coastal climate, with potential for foggy conditions in the morning and a risk of light precipitation if the low-pressure trend continues.
