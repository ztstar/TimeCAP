Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained high throughout the period, particularly in the early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that may contribute to discomfort and potential for localized precipitation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline in the latter half of the day, signaling a possible approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, which often transports moist air into the region. These combined trends point to a developing atmospheric setup conducive to thunderstorm development, especially during the late evening and overnight hours.
