Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or low-lying clouds as moisture accumulated in the atmosphere. Air pressure increased consistently throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, typically associated with stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a consistent northerly to northwesterly flow, contributing to the cooling trend and helping to disperse moisture. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable weather, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
