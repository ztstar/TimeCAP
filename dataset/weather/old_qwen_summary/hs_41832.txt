Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong daytime heating pattern. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours and remained elevated through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a gradual increase, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift in direction toward the southeast and south, potentially indicating an approaching system or local convective activity. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests conditions favorable for the development of thunderstorms later in the day.
