Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the overnight hours, followed by a recovery, indicating possible passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly and easterly directions in the early morning to more variable and stronger winds later in the day, particularly in the late evening, which may signal changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period marked by moisture accumulation, temperature fluctuations, and shifting wind patterns—conditions that could support the development of thunderstorms later in the day.
