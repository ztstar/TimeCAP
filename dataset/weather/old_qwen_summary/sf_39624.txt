Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability, potentially linked to marine influence. Air pressure showed a consistent decline in the latter half of the period, indicating a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, with strong northerly to westerly flows, then diminished before increasing again in the late evening, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly suggests dynamic atmospheric changes, possibly signaling a transition in local weather patterns.
