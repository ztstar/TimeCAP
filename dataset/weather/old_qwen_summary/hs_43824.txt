Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation and possibly a transition toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the day, culminating in a high-pressure buildup, which typically correlates with clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midnight, with a sudden change in direction from northerly to predominantly southerly, accompanied by reduced speeds, signaling a possible weakening of a frontal boundary or a change in local circulation. The combination of rising pressure, warming temperatures, and steady wind suggests improving weather conditions, with a potential for partly cloudy skies and a lower likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
