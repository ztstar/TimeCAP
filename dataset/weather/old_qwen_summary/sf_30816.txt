Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels peaked dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late night and early morning, with winds veering from the northwest to the southeast, coinciding with the onset of fog and a temporary increase in air pressure. The wind speed remained relatively low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon, suggesting a developing onshore flow that may bring cooler, marine air into the region. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and variable wind directions indicates persistent marine influence, consistent with typical coastal fog events in the area.
