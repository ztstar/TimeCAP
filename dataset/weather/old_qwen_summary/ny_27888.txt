Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cold front passage during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night, suggesting fog or drizzle formation, particularly during the coldest period. A notable shift in air pressure—rising sharply during the night and stabilizing in the morning—points to the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds increased during the overnight hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, aligning with the arrival of colder air. These combined factors suggest a transition from damp, cold conditions to drier, more stable weather, likely improving visibility and comfort by late morning.
