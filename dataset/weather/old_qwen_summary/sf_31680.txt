Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of marine layer conditions typical of the region’s foggy mornings. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the day, reflecting stable atmospheric conditions with no significant storm systems approaching. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a more stable and breezy afternoon environment, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns.
