Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and a noticeable chill in the air. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate until late evening, when they intensified, particularly from the northwest, suggesting a shift in wind patterns that could signal changing weather dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and persistent northerly winds points to a transition toward drier and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
