Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with periods of very high moisture content, particularly in the early morning, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained consistently high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a strong high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development. Wind speeds exhibited significant variability, with strong gusts in the early morning and late evening, likely associated with coastal breezes and topographic influences, while direction shifts suggest dynamic airflow changes across the region. These patterns collectively suggest a typical marine layer regime, with cool, damp air near the surface and a warming trend aloft, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate during transitional periods.
