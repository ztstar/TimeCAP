Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the overnight period, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion and potential fog formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, reaching a high point in the early morning before stabilizing, suggesting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were initially moderate and consistent from the southeast, but diminished significantly during the night, with near-calms reported at dawn, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon. Wind direction shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from southeasterly to northeasterly and eventually to a westerly flow, reflecting the complex interaction of coastal topography and synoptic-scale patterns.
