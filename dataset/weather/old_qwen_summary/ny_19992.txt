Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity remained high in the initial phase before gradually decreasing, suggesting a shift from saturated air conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns point to the arrival of a cold, dry air mass, likely resulting in clearer skies and cooler conditions in the near term.
