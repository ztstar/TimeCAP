Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend with a subsequent warming phase. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply in the late morning, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, reflecting a consistent high-pressure influence that likely contributed to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from the northwest to the west and southwest, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of warming temperatures, declining humidity, and strengthening winds indicates the approach of a drier, more dynamic air mass, which may lead to improved visibility and potentially clearer skies in the coming hours.
