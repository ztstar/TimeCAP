Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight period, peaking near saturation, which suggests the development of fog or low stratus clouds, consistent with the region’s marine layer patterns. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning coincided with increased wind speeds and shifting wind directions, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. The wind direction transitioned from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, reinforcing the influence of coastal dynamics and potential upslope or downslope flow. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with strong potential for foggy mornings and clearing skies by midday, especially as pressure stabilizes and winds moderate later in the day.
