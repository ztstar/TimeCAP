Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal temperature inversion followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a shift from saturated air conditions to drier, more stable air as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and afternoon, with peak gusts from the northwest, indicating strong surface-level air flow associated with the advancing high-pressure front. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and sustained northwest winds points to improving weather conditions, likely leading to a dry and cooler day ahead.
