Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to misty or foggy conditions, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a notable increase in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief bursts of stronger winds during the late night and early afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing air mass dynamics. These observations point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable night into a more variable and gradually warming day, with potential for improved visibility and mild conditions later in the period.
