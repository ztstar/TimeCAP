Temperature showed a gradual increase throughout the day, followed by a sharp rise in the early hours, indicating a warming trend likely due to solar heating and atmospheric dynamics. Humidity declined steadily during the afternoon, reaching a low before recovering slightly in the evening, suggesting dry air advection or subsidence. Air pressure remained nearly stable until a slight drop in the late afternoon, followed by a rebound, which may signal a passing weather front or localized atmospheric adjustment. Wind speed exhibited a marked reduction in the mid-afternoon, with a temporary lull before increasing again, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing synoptic influences. The combination of rising temperature, decreasing humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a transition toward a drier and more unstable air mass, potentially increasing the risk of heat stress and affecting outdoor conditions.
