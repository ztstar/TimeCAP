Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp drop in the mid-morning, followed by a dramatic increase in the late night, indicating possible precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east sectors, contributing to a more unsettled atmosphere. These combined indicators point to a transition period likely associated with a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing rain or overcast conditions in the near term.
