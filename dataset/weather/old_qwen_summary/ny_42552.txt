Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting moisture accumulation possibly linked to a shift in air mass or overnight condensation. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of approaching storm systems. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon, with directional shifts indicating changing local flow patterns, possibly influenced by urban heat dynamics or synoptic-scale adjustments. Overall, the data point to a stable, gradually warming day following a cool, humid night, with no immediate signs of precipitation or severe weather.
