Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Temperatures declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before rising sharply in the afternoon, indicating a marked diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and increased discomfort. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, with strong westerly and southerly flows, followed by a shift to more variable and generally weaker winds later in the day. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind directions points to a dynamic weather transition, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms or heavy precipitation as the system evolves.
