Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning, reaching a peak midday before declining slightly in the evening, which may reflect a passing high-pressure system or changing frontal activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and afternoon, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, potentially signaling the approach of a moist onshore flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward more humid and unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
