Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning. A steady increase in air pressure throughout the night and into the morning indicates the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, contributing to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southerly and then easterly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, with potential for improved visibility and reduced precipitation risk in the near term.
