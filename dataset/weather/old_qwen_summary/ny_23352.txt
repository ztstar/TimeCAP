Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, followed by a steady recovery in the morning, indicating a cool nocturnal period with a warming trend during the day. Humidity remained consistently high during the early morning and late evening hours, with notable drops during midday, suggesting possible evaporation or air mass changes. Air pressure exhibited a slight upward trend in the afternoon, followed by a minor dip in the evening, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, particularly from the northeast, and then stabilized at lower levels, implying a transition from a more active to a calmer atmospheric state. Combined with the shift in wind direction from northeasterly to easterly and southeasterly, these patterns suggest the influence of a passing low-pressure feature, potentially bringing unsettled conditions in the near term.
