Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a high moisture content in the air that may contribute to discomfort and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with notable increases during the early morning and late evening, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from northerly to easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These indicators collectively suggest a transition toward more stable and potentially dry conditions, though lingering moisture and residual wind activity could still support isolated showers later in the day.
