Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained persistently high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. As the morning progressed, humidity dropped sharply, particularly in the late afternoon, coinciding with a decrease in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward more easterly and southerly sectors. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating a potential approaching low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation in the coming hours. The wind speed increased significantly in the final hours, especially from the north-northeast, suggesting a strengthening circulation pattern that could enhance coastal upwelling and reinforce the marine layer.
