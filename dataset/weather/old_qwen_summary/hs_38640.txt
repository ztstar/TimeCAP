Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction toward the south and southwest, signaling potential storm development. The sustained increase in wind speed, especially in the late afternoon and evening, along with shifting wind direction, points to the approach of a dynamic weather system, possibly a cold front or thunderstorm activity. These combined indicators suggest an elevated risk of strong convective activity in the coming hours, with potential for heavy rain and gusty winds across the region.
