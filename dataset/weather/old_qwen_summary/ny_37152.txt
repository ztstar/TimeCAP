Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting a shift from stable to more variable moisture conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather.
