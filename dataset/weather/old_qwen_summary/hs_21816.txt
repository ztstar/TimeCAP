Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to increased cloud formation or potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, which, combined with increasing humidity and stable wind patterns, may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds weakened during the night and early morning, then increased again in the afternoon, with consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, indicating possible onshore transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined conditions point to a transition toward more unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
