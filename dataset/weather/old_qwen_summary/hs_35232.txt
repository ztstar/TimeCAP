Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of stable, warm temperatures followed by a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, indicating a nighttime temperature drop likely driven by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, then steadily decreased throughout the day, suggesting a transition from moist air to drier conditions, possibly due to mixing or subsidence. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend overnight, peaking in the early morning before stabilizing, which is typical of a high-pressure system influencing the region and promoting clear, calm weather. Wind speeds remained low and generally light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly, implying a change in local flow patterns that may signal an approaching weather feature. Overall, the data reflect a stable, dry, and gradually cooling atmosphere, consistent with fair weather conditions and minimal risk of precipitation or severe weather in the near term.
