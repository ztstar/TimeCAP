Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, then increasing again in the evening, indicating a possible marine layer influence. Air pressure showed a sharp increase during the midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low except for a brief surge in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, possibly signaling a temporary change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from cool, damp conditions to a more stable, warming environment, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate dynamics.
