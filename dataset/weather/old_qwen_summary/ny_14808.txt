Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicating a cooling trend followed by a mild recovery. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel. Air pressure showed a notable rise toward the end of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, possibly indicating shifting air masses. The combination of rising pressure, moderate winds, and decreasing humidity suggests improving weather conditions and a transition toward more pleasant and settled skies.
