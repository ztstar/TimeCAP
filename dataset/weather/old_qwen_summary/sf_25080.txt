Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface, while elevated moisture in the early morning points to frequent fog formation common to the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day before a notable decrease in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system or a shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the midday and late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with the prevailing onshore flow that often brings cool, moist air into the city. The wind direction variability, especially the shift toward westerly and southerly flows later in the day, supports the presence of a developing low-pressure influence, which may lead to changing weather conditions in the coming hours.
