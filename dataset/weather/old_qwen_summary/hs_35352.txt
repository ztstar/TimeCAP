Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure increased steadily through the morning and early afternoon, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, which may point to the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low during most of the day but intensified in the late afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in dominant wind flow. These combined indicators suggest the weather transitioned from a stable, humid nighttime regime to a more dynamic, drying, and potentially unsettled period, raising the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms or scattered showers later in the day.
