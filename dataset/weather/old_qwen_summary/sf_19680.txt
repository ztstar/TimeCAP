Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or shifting weather patterns. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning hours and weakened through the day, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the northeast to more easterly and then northerly, reflecting changing synoptic conditions. Together, these trends point to a transition period with increasing instability, potentially leading to overcast conditions or light precipitation later in the day.
