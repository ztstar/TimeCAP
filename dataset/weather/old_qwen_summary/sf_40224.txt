Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a more moderate daytime period. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a clearance of fog or low clouds as the sun rose and surface temperatures increased. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning was followed by a sustained period of high pressure, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, with strong, persistent winds from the west to northwest, consistent with a typical coastal wind pattern driven by the pressure gradient between the ocean and inland areas. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic marine layer evolution, with fog dissipation and a strengthening onshore flow, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
