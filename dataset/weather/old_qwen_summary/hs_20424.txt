Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increasing moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased instability. Wind speed increased steadily through the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to more southeasterly, consistent with inflow from the Gulf of Mexico and enhanced moisture transport. These combined indicators suggest the onset of a more humid, potentially storm-prone weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
