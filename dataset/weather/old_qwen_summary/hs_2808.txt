Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, signaling the approach of a weather system, possibly a frontal passage, which was later followed by a slow recovery in pressure, suggesting stabilization. Wind patterns shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from consistent southerly winds to near-calms and then re-establishing from the southeast and eventually the west-southwest, consistent with changing synoptic influences. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind flow suggests a transition period that may increase the risk of thunderstorms or showers in the coming hours.
