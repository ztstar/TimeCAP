Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure showed a gradual increase overnight, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southwesterly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns suggest the passage of a transient weather system, with potential for increasing afternoon heat and reduced moisture availability later in the day.
