Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that began in the early morning and intensified through the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the first half of the day before sharply declining, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed, likely due to changing air mass dynamics. Air pressure showed a slight increase in the early hours, followed by a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, indicating a change in atmospheric flow that could support storm development. Together, these patterns suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the risk of afternoon or evening thunderstorms.
