Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning period, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, possibly due to nocturnal condensation or a low-level moisture surge. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, then stabilized and slightly declined in the late afternoon, indicating a developing high-pressure system that may have suppressed convective activity. Wind patterns revealed a shift from calm conditions overnight to increasing wind speeds in the late afternoon, with a change in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, hinting at a possible boundary interaction or sea-breeze onset. These combined trends suggest a transition from stable, humid nighttime conditions toward a more dynamic, potentially unstable environment in the coming hours, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient lift is introduced.
