Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating a transition toward more stable daytime conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon, suggesting persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere, which can contribute to oppressive feels and potential for convective activity. Air pressure declined significantly during the night and early morning, followed by a slow recovery, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal influence that may have triggered localized weather changes. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and shifting wind directions, including a shift to more southerly flows, which typically bring in warm, moist air from the Gulf. These combined factors—rising temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—indicate a developing environment conducive to thunderstorm potential, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours.
