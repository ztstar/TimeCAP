Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal moisture buildup followed by drying due to daytime heating. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before easing slightly, which is indicative of a developing high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds remained light overnight, with a notable shift from calm conditions to modest breezes in the afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, hinting at a developing onshore flow. These patterns collectively suggest a transition toward more stable, dry conditions with a potential for clearing skies, though lingering moisture early in the cycle may increase the risk of isolated showers in the morning hours.
