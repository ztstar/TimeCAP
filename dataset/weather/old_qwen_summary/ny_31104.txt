Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours, spiked dramatically in the late night and early morning, and then dropped sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from a dry, stable air mass to a moist, possibly unstable one. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before slightly declining, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system moving in and gradually weakening. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable lull during the early hours, and wind direction shifted significantly from northerly and westerly to southerly and easterly later in the day, indicating a change in airflow associated with the approaching weather system. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a warm, moist air mass, potentially leading to increasing cloudiness and a higher chance of precipitation in the coming hours.
