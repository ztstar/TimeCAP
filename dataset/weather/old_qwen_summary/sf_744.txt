Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the mid-afternoon, indicating a possible breakdown in fog or low cloud cover. A persistent wind pattern from the south and southeast during the night transitioned to calm conditions by morning, with a resurgence of offshore winds in the late afternoon, likely contributing to the clearing skies. Air pressure remained stable overall, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may be stabilizing the weather. These changes point to a transition from a moist, cool marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
