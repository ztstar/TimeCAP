Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon. A persistent drop in air pressure indicates the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, which correlates with worsening conditions and increasing wind activity. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, with gusts reaching notable levels, followed by a significant reduction in wind intensity during midday, suggesting a temporary stabilization. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, peaking in the early morning and late night, which may have contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly flows reflects the influence of a frontal system, likely bringing cooler, drier air and setting the stage for changing weather patterns in the coming hours.
