Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the potential for fog or mist formation during low-temperature periods. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a brief increase during the midday hours, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure influence. This combination of rising pressure, stable temperatures, and moderate humidity suggests a period of improving weather conditions, with reduced chances of precipitation and enhanced comfort levels as the system settles over the region.
