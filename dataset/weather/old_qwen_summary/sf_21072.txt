Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with changing or deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to more westerly and southerly sectors, consistent with a developing marine layer and potential fog formation. These combined indicators point to a likely period of foggy, cool, and damp conditions, particularly during the early morning hours, which may impact visibility and commute conditions across the city.
