Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the late afternoon, peaking around midday before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the afternoon, with strong southerly and easterly flows, potentially signaling a shift in airflow due to regional pressure gradients. These patterns collectively point to a dynamic transition from a cool, foggy night into a warmer, windier afternoon, typical of San Francisco's microclimate influenced by coastal air masses.
