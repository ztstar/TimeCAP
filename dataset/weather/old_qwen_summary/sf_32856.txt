Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, which suggests the dissipation of fog and low clouds as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the afternoon and evening, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved conditions. Wind speeds were low overnight, increasing slightly in the early morning before calming again, with wind direction shifting from northerly to westerly and then back to more southerly, reflecting complex coastal airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and humid marine layer to a warmer, drier, and more stable environment, typical of a summer day in San Francisco’s microclimate.
