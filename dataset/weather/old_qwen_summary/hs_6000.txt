Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before a sharp drop during midday, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup followed by drying, likely due to increasing temperatures and wind. Air pressure showed a brief decline during the night, followed by a recovery and stabilization, with a minor low-pressure signature early on, which may have contributed to the development of localized cloudiness and dew formation. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the period, with a distinct shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and eventually westerly, indicating a change in air mass and potential for developing convection later in the day. The combination of rising temperatures, shifting wind patterns, and lingering humidity suggests increasing instability, raising the potential for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient lift is introduced.
