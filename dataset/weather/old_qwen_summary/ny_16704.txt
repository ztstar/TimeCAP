Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a high level, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to light during most of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast by late afternoon, possibly indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. These combined trends suggest that New York City experienced a clear, stable, and warming pattern overnight, with conditions now trending toward fair and dry weather, likely continuing into the coming hours.
