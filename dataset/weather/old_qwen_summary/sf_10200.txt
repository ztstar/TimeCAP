Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and overnight hours, dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer dissipation as daytime heating intensified. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning before a slight decline, pointing to a stable high-pressure system with possible weakening later in the day. Wind speeds were consistently low except during brief periods of calm, with a notable shift in wind direction from a consistent northwest flow to variable and even southerly directions in the afternoon, indicating a potential change in local circulation patterns. These dynamics suggest the transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, warmer regime, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility by midday.
