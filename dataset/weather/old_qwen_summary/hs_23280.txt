Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining through the night, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, reaching near saturation, which suggests the presence of a moist, stable air mass promoting fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach or influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and possible boundary layer adjustments. These combined patterns point to a transition toward more stable, calm, and humid conditions, with reduced convective potential and limited precipitation risk in the immediate forecast.
