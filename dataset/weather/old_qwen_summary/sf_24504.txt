Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels exhibited a striking oscillation, alternating between high and low values, suggesting intermittent fog or marine layer activity, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure showed a mix of stable and fluctuating patterns, with notable high-pressure systems contributing to periods of dry air and clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly during the midday and late evening, driven by shifts in wind direction from offshore to onshore and cross-valley flows, possibly enhancing coastal mixing. These dynamics point to a transition from a fog-prone, stable marine layer to a more variable and slightly drier regime, with implications for visibility, temperature comfort, and potential for afternoon breezes.
