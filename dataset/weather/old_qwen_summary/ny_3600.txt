Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising during the day, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise, which is often associated with the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent stabilization. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with calm periods and occasional gusts, while wind direction shifted frequently—particularly from the west and southwest—indicating dynamic airflow changes. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cold, moist, and unstable air mass to a drier and slightly warmer regime, potentially signaling improving conditions in the coming hours.
