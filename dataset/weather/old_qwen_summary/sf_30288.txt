Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, especially in lower-lying and coastal areas. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midday, with winds weakening and shifting toward the northeast, coinciding with a drop in humidity and a rise in air pressure, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds remained generally low during the night and early morning, but increased briefly in the late evening, potentially signaling the onset of a change in atmospheric stability. The overall pattern reflects a transition from a moist, cool, and fog-prone environment to a drier and more stable air mass, with implications for visibility and comfort during the day.
