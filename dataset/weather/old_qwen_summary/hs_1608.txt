Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a marked rise in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal warming trend typical of the region’s humid climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of stable, moist air masses conducive to fog or low cloud formation. A gradual drop in air pressure was observed during the midday and early evening, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a weather system that may have brought transient instability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and southeasterly, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system or sea breeze circulation. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the atmosphere continues to destabilize.
