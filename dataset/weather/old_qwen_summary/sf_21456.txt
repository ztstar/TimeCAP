Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose markedly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase toward the end of the period, indicating improving weather conditions and potential clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with a consistent wind direction from the southwest, typical of coastal influences. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer pattern, with cool, damp air near the surface and a potential for foggy or overcast conditions early in the day, gradually lifting as pressure increases and winds shift.
