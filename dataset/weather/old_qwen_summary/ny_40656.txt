Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a milder day. Humidity levels remained high overnight, dropping significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the midday and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast, consistent with developing circulation around an approaching weather front. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic weather transition, with potential for precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
