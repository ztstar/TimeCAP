Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a marine layer or fog event. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early hours, followed by fluctuating but generally stable values, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially signaling the arrival of stronger coastal winds. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable coastal condition to a more variable and breezy environment, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate patterns.
