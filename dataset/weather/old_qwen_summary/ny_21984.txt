Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours, which suggests moisture accumulation and possible fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise during the night, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clear skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but increased in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, signaling a change in airflow. These trends point to a transition from a moist, stable night into a drier, slightly breezier afternoon, with potential for improving visibility and mild warming later in the day.
