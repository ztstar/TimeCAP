Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the late night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual stabilization, indicating a possible cold front passage. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the period, suggesting saturated air, which likely contributed to foggy or damp conditions during the night. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in tandem with the temperature drop, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that may bring further instability. Wind direction shifted abruptly from a southwest to a southward and then a northwest flow, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics and potential storm development. These combined indicators suggest a transition to potentially unsettled weather, with possible precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
