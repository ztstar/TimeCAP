Temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike during the early morning hours followed by a sharp drop, suggesting possible precipitation or fog dissipation. Air pressure increased steadily over the period, particularly in the late evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon before tapering off, with a shift in wind direction toward more southerly and westerly flows, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a progressively drier and more stable day, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge influencing the region.
