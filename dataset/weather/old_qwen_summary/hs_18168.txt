Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the day, indicating a saturated air mass that may contribute to muggy conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds remained low and variable during the night, increasing in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest the end of a humid, stable period and the onset of more favorable conditions, with reduced chances of precipitation and improved air quality.
