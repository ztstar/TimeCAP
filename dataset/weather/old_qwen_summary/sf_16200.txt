Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and possibly marine layer formation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility in coastal areas. Air pressure increased sharply during the night and stabilized at a high level, suggesting the arrival and persistence of a strong high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and then south-southeast, consistent with a landward flow under the influence of the high-pressure ridge. These conditions point to a stable, fog-prone environment typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with limited mixing and prolonged low-lying clouds through the morning hours.
