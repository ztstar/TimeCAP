Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a transitioning air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, indicating a possible clearing trend as dry air moved in. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a higher level, which typically signals improving weather and fair conditions. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and eventually westerly, suggesting a change in upper-level flow. Taken together, these indicators point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, likely reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
