Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained elevated overnight, peaking during the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before slightly declining, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were light and variable overnight, intensifying in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, reflecting changing synoptic patterns. These conditions point to the passage of a frontal boundary, with the potential for clearing skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
