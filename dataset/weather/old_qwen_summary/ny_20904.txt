Temperatures showed a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase interrupted by warming trends. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase during the late evening, indicating rising moisture content in the air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, particularly in the late afternoon, pointing to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a consistent easterly to northerly flow, which may have contributed to the cooling trend earlier in the day. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest in the final hours, combined with rising pressure and humidity, suggests the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly including the approach of a front or precipitation later in the day.
