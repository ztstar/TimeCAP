Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle with a notable cooling trend in the early hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting possible fog formation or moist air accumulation, which may have contributed to a damp feel during those hours. Air pressure exhibited a gradual drop through the night, followed by a sharp rise midday, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a high-pressure front, likely bringing clearer skies. Wind conditions remained relatively consistent with moderate speeds, shifting from southerly to more easterly directions during the afternoon, which may have aided in the dispersion of moisture and the stabilization of conditions. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a cooler, humid, and potentially overcast period to a drier, more stable environment, suggesting improving weather conditions heading into the next day.
