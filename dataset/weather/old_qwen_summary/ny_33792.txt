Over the past 24 hours, a notable drop in air pressure began in the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual increase through the day, indicating warming conditions, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking in the early hours before showing a slight decline, suggesting a moist air mass is present. Wind patterns shifted from a more southerly to a more westerly direction, with consistent speeds that decreased slightly in the late evening, possibly indicating a weakening of the frontal influence. Combined, these trends suggest the city is under the influence of a developing weather system, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
