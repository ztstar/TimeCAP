Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the early morning, suggesting moist air accumulation associated with the approaching front. Air pressure declined sharply in the late night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery, which is characteristic of a passing low-pressure system bringing unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, likely resulting in precipitation and cooler conditions, with potential for brief periods of rain or drizzle in the coming hours.
