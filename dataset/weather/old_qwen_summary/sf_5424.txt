Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, likely due to fog formation, which then decreased during the day as temperatures increased and air mixed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a brief spike was noted mid-morning, potentially indicating localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the southwest, consistent with onshore flow associated with marine layer development. These conditions point to a return of the familiar coastal fog and cool temperatures typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with a moderate increase in wind activity that may enhance coastal breezes and influence visibility.
