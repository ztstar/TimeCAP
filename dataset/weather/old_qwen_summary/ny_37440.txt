Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air and possible fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest and then toward the south and east, indicating a change in airflow likely associated with the advancing high. These combined trends point to improving weather conditions, with the potential for clear skies and cooler, drier air in the coming hours.
