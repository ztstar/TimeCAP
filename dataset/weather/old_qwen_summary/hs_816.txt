Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime highs. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early morning and late night, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, with a significant drop during the afternoon that likely contributed to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late evening and overnight hours, followed by a gradual rise in the morning, signaling potential changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases during the midday and late evening, and wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly, possibly indicating the influence of a developing pressure gradient. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a weak frontal system, with conditions favoring increasing warmth and drying later in the day, which may contribute to elevated heat stress by late afternoon.
