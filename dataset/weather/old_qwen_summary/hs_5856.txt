Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a strong moisture influx, likely associated with a stalled front or low-pressure system. Air pressure rose sharply in the early hours, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system, which later weakened as pressure dropped significantly in the late evening. Wind speeds showed a dramatic shift, with calm conditions prevailing during the night, followed by a sudden and sustained increase in wind strength and a change in wind direction, pointing to the arrival of a storm system or frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a period of unstable weather, with potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall, especially given the abrupt wind shift and high moisture content.
