Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, starting high and dropping sharply in the midday, which likely contributed to a more comfortable feel despite rising temperatures. Air pressure increased steadily through the morning and early afternoon, peaking before a sudden drop in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and late evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly associated with offshore or onshore influences. These combined dynamics point to a transition in local atmospheric conditions, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather front.
