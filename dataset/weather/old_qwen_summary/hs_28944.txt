Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, peaking in the afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, indicating a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, remaining high through midday, which suggests the presence of moist air masses typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early afternoon, followed by a rebound late in the day, signaling possible atmospheric instability and the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, potentially indicating the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined patterns—rising temperatures, high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and strengthening winds—point to conditions conducive to thunderstorm development, particularly during the evening hours.
