Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a nighttime low before gradually rising again, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light during the night but intensified in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, pointing to a change in atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest a developing weather pattern that could lead to precipitation or cloud cover in the near term.
