Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a warmer, more active daytime period. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midday, with wind speeds increasing and direction changing from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, suggesting the influence of a passing weather system. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. These conditions collectively suggest an evolving weather pattern that could lead to increased chances of thunderstorm development later in the day.
