Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing in the late morning, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose during early hours, peaked in the pre-dawn period, then dropped sharply, suggesting the passage of a cold front or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing and gradually rising, which is characteristic of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the early morning hours, with sustained high winds from the northwest and west, likely contributing to the rapid cooling and dispersal of moisture. The combination of dropping pressure, strong winds, and decreasing humidity points to a transition toward clearer skies and cooler, drier conditions, with potential for gusty conditions persisting into the afternoon.
