Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly during the afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind patterns showed minimal activity during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but strengthened in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south, likely due to a developing sea breeze. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and increasing wind from the southeast points toward a potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term, especially as daytime heating resumes.
