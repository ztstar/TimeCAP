Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to increased convective activity later. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly, consistent with a change in synoptic flow that could influence storm development. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day due to increasing instability and moisture convergence.
