Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with nighttime cooling and daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of moist air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-to-upper range, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more easterly and then southeasterly direction, with speeds increasing notably in the late evening, likely driven by a developing surface pressure gradient. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a drier, windier, and potentially more unsettled afternoon and evening, with implications for outdoor activities and air quality.
