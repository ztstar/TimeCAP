Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, which likely contributed to a more oppressive feel despite cooler temperatures. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally correlates with stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the night, particularly from the west and northwest, suggesting the passage of a boundary or frontal influence, while wind directions shifted toward the north and east in the early morning hours. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, unstable environment to a drier, more stable regime, likely leading to improved conditions with clearer skies later in the day.
