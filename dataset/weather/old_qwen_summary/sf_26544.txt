Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a steady rise in the morning, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by coastal influence and fog development. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the formation and subsequent dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a changing weather system. Wind patterns were generally light and variable overnight, with a shift toward stronger and more consistent winds in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to increased pressure gradients. These conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with coastal fog forming overnight and clearing by midday, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
