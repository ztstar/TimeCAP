Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity reached near-saturation levels during the night and early morning, indicating strong moisture presence, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable pressure dip occurred in the early hours, followed by a sharp increase, suggesting the passage of a cold front or weather system that brought stable conditions later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from weak, variable flows to more consistent breezes in the afternoon, with a dominant southwest to westward component during peak daytime hours, typical of coastal upwelling. These conditions point to a transition from a moist, stable coastal environment to a drier, more variable regime, with implications for fog clearance and temperature moderation later in the day.
