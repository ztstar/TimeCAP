Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced decline, indicating drying air, which may contribute to increased comfort but also elevate fire risk if sustained. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified through the night and early morning, peaking around dawn before subsiding, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, suggesting changing synoptic flow. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable, and potentially warmer weather in the coming hours, with reduced chances of precipitation.
