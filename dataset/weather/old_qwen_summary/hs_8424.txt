Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked at near saturation during the overnight hours, creating persistent fog and reducing visibility, which likely contributed to poor air quality and discomfort. A notable pressure rise in the early morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which may have suppressed storm development but also led to stagnant air conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors suggest a dynamic transition in Houston's weather, with conditions becoming increasingly unstable and possibly conducive to afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
