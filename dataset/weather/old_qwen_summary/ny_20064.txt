Over the past 24 hours, temperatures remained consistently low during the early morning hours before gradually increasing in the afternoon, indicating a stabilization of cold conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in mid-morning before declining, suggesting a possible shift in moisture content as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a sustained drop during the early to mid-day, followed by a sharp rebound late in the day, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late hours, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southwest to west and eventually northwest, indicating changing wind patterns. These combined trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric transition, potentially leading to variable conditions such as clearing skies or localized precipitation later in the day.
