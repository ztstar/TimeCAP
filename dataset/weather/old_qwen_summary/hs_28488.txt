Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp decline in the afternoon and a spike to near saturation in the late night, indicating possible precipitation activity. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate to low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to northerly, reinforcing the influence of a developing weather front. These combined patterns suggest a transition period marked by unstable conditions, potentially leading to scattered thunderstorms or lingering showers in the coming hours.
