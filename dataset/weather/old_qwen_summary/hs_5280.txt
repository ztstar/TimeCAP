Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly during nighttime hours, suggesting moisture accumulation that could contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline toward the end of the period, signaling a potential approaching weather system, possibly a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, which may indicate the influence of a developing moisture-laden airflow. These combined factors suggest an increasing likelihood of unstable conditions, potentially leading to thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
