Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a persistent fog or mist condition during the early hours, particularly around dawn. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have facilitated the moisture buildup and reduced wind speeds. Wind patterns shifted from moderate easterly to southerly flow during the night, then increased in speed and shifted to a more westerly direction in the late evening, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These conditions collectively point to a transitioning weather pattern, potentially setting the stage for unstable air and the risk of afternoon thunderstorms as temperatures rise and moisture remains elevated.
