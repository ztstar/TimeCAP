Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, suggesting potential for fog or low clouds, before dropping significantly in the afternoon, which likely led to clearer conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and into the early morning, then stabilized, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to the approaching or passing frontal system. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, humid, and stable nighttime environment to a drier, breezier, and increasingly unstable daytime atmosphere, which could support the development of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
