Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle, with a steady cooldown through the night followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more dynamic daytime regime. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a sharp increase later in the evening, suggesting the passage of a weather front or a developing low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind patterns shifted dramatically in the afternoon, with stronger, more variable winds originating from the southeast and later from the southwest, consistent with changing pressure gradients and potential storm development. These combined factors—rising moisture, pressure changes, and shifting wind directions—indicate a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day or overnight, warranting close monitoring for severe weather.
