Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a modest increase in the afternoon, suggesting a return of sun-driven warming after a cool, stable period. Air pressure remained consistently high, with a slight rise during the midday and early evening, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and minimal chance of storm development. Wind speeds were low throughout, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and later westerly, possibly reflecting a change in airflow patterns associated with coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a typical San Francisco foggy night transitioning into a cooler, stable afternoon with limited precipitation risk and favorable visibility.
