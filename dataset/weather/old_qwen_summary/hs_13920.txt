Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture content in the air—potentially conducive to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with a notable drop during the early morning hours, indicating possible low-pressure influence that may have contributed to the rising humidity and unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with consistent southerly to westerly flow during the night and a shift toward more variable directions in the afternoon, possibly signaling changing air mass dynamics. The combination of increasing temperatures, lingering high humidity, and shifting wind patterns implies a transition toward potentially unstable conditions later in the day, which could support the development of isolated showers or thunderstorms.
