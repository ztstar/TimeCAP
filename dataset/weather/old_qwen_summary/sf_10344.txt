Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the early hours, followed by a recovery and a peak in the late evening, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent stabilization. Wind speeds were generally light, except for a strong gust in the final hour, driven by a shift in wind direction from the west to the northeast, which may signal changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns suggest the influence of a coastal front or marine layer transition, with potential for clearing skies and improving visibility in the coming hours.
