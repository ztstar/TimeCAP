Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions and increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified substantially during the night, with strong gusts observed, particularly from the southwest and west sectors, suggesting a shift in wind patterns associated with the approaching system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and strong, variable winds points to a maritime influence and possible rainfall in the near term, consistent with San Francisco’s typical coastal weather dynamics.
