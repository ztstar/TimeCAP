Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase later in the day, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a warming trend. Humidity remained consistently high throughout, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early afternoon, peaking significantly, which typically signals the approach of a stable high-pressure system and improving weather. Wind speeds were generally low overnight and increased during the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass influences. The combination of elevated humidity, rising pressure, and consistent wind patterns points to a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, likely reducing the risk of thunderstorms in the near term.
