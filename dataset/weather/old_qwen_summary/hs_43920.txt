Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, which may suggest the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from a southerly to easterly direction, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could influence the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
