Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a marked diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of marine layer formation and subsequent dissipation as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, with a notable spike during the early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, indicating changes in local circulation patterns possibly driven by the pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool coastal conditions to clearer, warmer weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
