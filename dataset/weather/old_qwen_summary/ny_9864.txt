Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual decline overnight, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating warming influenced by the passage of a frontal boundary. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air associated with the approaching system. Wind speeds remained moderate but steady, with a notable shift in direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing weather patterns linked to the low-pressure system. These combined indicators point to a transition toward unstable, potentially rainy weather, particularly affecting the later part of the day and into the evening.
