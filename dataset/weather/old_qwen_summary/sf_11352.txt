Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a stable temperature profile with minimal fluctuations, indicating a consistent thermal environment likely influenced by marine layer conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours and remained elevated, suggesting the presence of moist air masses typical of coastal fog formation. Air pressure remained constant throughout the period, reflecting a lack of significant weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds were low initially, increasing slightly in the early morning and maintaining a steady, light flow from the northwest, which is characteristic of offshore breezes that can enhance fog dispersion. The consistent wind direction from the northwest, combined with stable pressure and high humidity, points to a persistent marine influence, likely resulting in foggy conditions during overnight and early morning hours, with gradual clearing as the day progresses.
