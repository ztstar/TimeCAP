Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, maintaining near-100% for an extended period before declining, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level stratus clouds. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, peaking midday before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible passing frontal system. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and decreased significantly overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns indicates a strong likelihood of persistent fog, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which may impact visibility and commute conditions.
