Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, then dropped significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified during the evening, particularly in the late hours, with strong southerly and westerly flows suggesting a shift in atmospheric circulation. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a dynamic weather transition, possibly signaling the arrival of a coastal front or a change in synoptic conditions affecting the region.
