Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight period, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A strong shift in wind patterns occurred during the night, marked by elevated wind speeds and a consistent westerly to northwesterly flow, suggesting the influence of a coastal upwelling or marine layer surge. Air pressure showed a slight increase in the latter part of the day, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable winds suggests a persistent marine influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy mornings and cool, breezy afternoons.
