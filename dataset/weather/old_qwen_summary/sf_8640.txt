Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily decreasing through the night before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours followed by a significant drop, indicating a shift in air mass or the influence of changing wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the early morning and late afternoon, primarily from the west and north sectors, which may have contributed to the temperature fluctuations. The combination of rising pressure, increasing temperature, and variable wind direction suggests a transition toward more stable and potentially sunny conditions in the coming hours.
