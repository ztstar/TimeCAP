Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a cooling nocturnal period likely influenced by marine layer formation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before a sharp decline during midday, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as solar heating increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then dropped sharply in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather disturbance or frontal system. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with onshore flow and potential storm development. The shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then easterly patterns, combined with the pressure drop, implies a dynamic atmospheric setup that may lead to changing conditions, including possible rain or fog resurgence later in the day.
