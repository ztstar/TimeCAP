Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the onset of drying conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southeasterly, which may indicate changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching system. These combined trends suggest increasing instability and potential for thunderstorms or precipitation in the near term.
