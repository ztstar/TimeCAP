Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with sustained strong gusts from the south-southeast quadrant, consistent with a developing circulation pattern associated with the low-pressure system. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind speeds, and shifting wind direction suggests the potential for thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, warranting weather vigilance.
