Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp drop in the early morning followed by a rebound in the late afternoon, suggesting possible clearing skies and increased mixing in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from consistent westerly to variable and light in the early morning, then strengthened from the northeast and east in the late afternoon, consistent with changing frontal influences. Combined, these trends suggest a transition period in the city’s weather, likely leading to increasing cloud cover and potential precipitation in the near term.
