Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable shift to stronger and more variable winds in the afternoon, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind suggests that while conditions were initially stable and damp, a transition toward more dynamic and potentially unsettled weather may be underway.
