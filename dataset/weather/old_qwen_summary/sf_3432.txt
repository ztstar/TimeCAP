Temperatures exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear diurnal pattern influenced by overnight cooling and morning solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature inversion observed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night and early morning, with periods of calm and shifts in direction indicating changing local wind patterns, possibly due to topographic influences. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and calm night toward a warmer, drier, and more stable day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
