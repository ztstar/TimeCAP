Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply decreasing in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained stable through the night, then showed a slight downward trend in the late afternoon, potentially signaling an approaching weather change or shift in atmospheric circulation. Wind speeds were low and consistent throughout the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind directions shifting from southwesterly to more westerly, consistent with a strengthening coastal breeze. These patterns collectively suggest the presence of a persistent marine layer that has begun to break down, leading to clearer skies and milder conditions later in the day.
