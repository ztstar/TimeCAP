Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and midday, peaking in the afternoon before beginning to decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system or incipient low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a notable reduction in the late afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted from predominantly northwest to northeast, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for increased instability and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
