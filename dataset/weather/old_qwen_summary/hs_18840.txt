Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for elevated heat stress. Humidity levels showed a marked decline, particularly in the afternoon and evening, which could contribute to a more uncomfortable perceived temperature despite the drop in moisture content. Air pressure gradually decreased, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather in the near future. Wind speeds increased notably throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with a developing surface flow associated with the approaching system. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with rising temperatures, drying air, and strengthening winds potentially setting the stage for thunderstorm development later in the day.
