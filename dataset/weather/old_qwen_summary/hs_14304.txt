Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, with a notable decrease in the late morning and afternoon. Air pressure showed a temporary spike in the early hours, suggesting a brief influence of a high-pressure system, though it stabilized afterward, indicating relatively stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southwest, potentially aiding in the dispersion of moisture and influencing local air quality. The shift in wind direction from variable to consistently southerly and southeasterly suggests an onshore flow, which may support the potential for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
