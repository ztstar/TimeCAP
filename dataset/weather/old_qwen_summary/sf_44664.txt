Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent values indicate a persistent maritime influence, likely due to the presence of a stable high-pressure system steering cool, moist air from the Pacific Ocean. The low humidity levels suggest dry air near the surface, which, combined with the steady wind from the southeast, may contribute to a reduced chance of fog formation despite the coastal proximity. The unchanging wind direction and speed point to a lack of dynamic weather systems or frontal activity, reinforcing the overall atmospheric tranquility. As a result, the city has maintained a uniformly mild and dry climate, with no immediate signs of precipitation or changing conditions.
