Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a mix of overnight condensation and daytime drying. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a noticeable surge in the final few hours, driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and southerly sectors consistent with storm development. These combined patterns point to an active weather transition, with potential for precipitation and gusty conditions in the near term.
