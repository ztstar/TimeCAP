Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity reached near saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure remained stable with a slight increase during the night, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has helped maintain relatively calm and dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds were consistently low until late afternoon, when they increased, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then northwest, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition period, possibly setting the stage for clearer skies and fresher air later in the day.
