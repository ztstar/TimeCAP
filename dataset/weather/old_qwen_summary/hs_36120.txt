Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels reached near saturation during the night and early morning, contributing to foggy conditions and a heavy dew point, which likely increased the perceived discomfort. A consistent increase in air pressure from late night through mid-morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, indicating improving and stable weather conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly, with increasing speed in the late evening, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. The combination of high humidity, a stable pressure regime, and variable wind directions points to a transition from a moist, stagnant air mass toward a drier, more settled atmosphere, potentially reducing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
