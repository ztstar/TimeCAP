Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early dawn, suggesting increased moisture availability likely due to coastal fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds were strongest during the overnight and pre-dawn hours, with sustained easterly to northerly flow, consistent with marine layer dynamics common in the region. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and westerly bearings in the afternoon, along with declining humidity, implies a potential break in the marine layer, suggesting improved visibility and clearer skies approaching.
