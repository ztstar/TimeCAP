Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal moisture buildup followed by daytime drying. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the early morning, hinting at the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions, though a brief drop later in the evening may signal a shift in airflow. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to southeasterly in the early hours, transitioning to more variable and stronger winds from the east and southeast in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by a developing surface pressure gradient. These combined trends suggest the approach of a boundary layer disturbance, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the night.
