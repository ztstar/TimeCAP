Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, remaining consistently high through the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a sustained increase during the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which is typically associated with improving weather conditions and stable atmospheric flow. Wind speeds increased steadily after midday, with a pronounced rise in the late afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system or boundary interaction. These combined factors—rising pressure, increasing winds, and changing wind direction—point to an evolving weather pattern that may lead to unsettled conditions, including potential thunderstorms later in the day.
