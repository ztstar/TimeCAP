Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity levels remained low during early morning hours, spiked significantly in the late afternoon and evening, culminating in saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and fair conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreased through the midday, and then increased again in the evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass dynamics. The convergence of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and variable winds points to a transition period, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies and cooler conditions in the near term.
