Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal phase to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking in the late evening, which may have contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feeling. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly, signaling the approach of a developing low-pressure system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably during the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts recorded in the final hours, likely driven by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly sectors. These combined factors suggest increasing instability and the potential for precipitation or stormy weather in the near term, warranting attention for residents and city operations.
