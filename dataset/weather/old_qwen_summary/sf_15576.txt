Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal fog event that dissipated as temperatures climbed. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift from southerly to westerly directions during the night, consistent with coastal upwelling and offshore flow patterns. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and falling pressure suggests a high likelihood of foggy mornings and potentially unsettled weather in the coming hours.
