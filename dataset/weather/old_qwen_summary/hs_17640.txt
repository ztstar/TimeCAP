Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier air. Air pressure showed a steady rise, particularly during the overnight hours, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift toward southerly to easterly directions during the night and early morning, followed by a reorientation toward more westerly flows later in the day, consistent with changing synoptic influences. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving conditions, with the potential for clearer skies and reduced moisture content in the coming hours.
