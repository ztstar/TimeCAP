Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperatures remained low overnight, with a sharp increase in the afternoon, suggesting a warming trend following the passage of the front. Humidity stayed consistently high throughout the period, contributing to a damp and muggy feel, especially during the temperature rise. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late morning and early afternoon, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest, consistent with storm dynamics. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the final hours may signal the system’s dissipation and the return of more stable, cooler air.
