Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining during the night and early morning before beginning a slow recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the overnight hours, peaking at very elevated levels and indicating a saturated air mass conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, particularly in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns exhibited a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, with increased speeds during the early morning, consistent with a developing maritime influence. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of overcast conditions and potential for light precipitation in the near term.
