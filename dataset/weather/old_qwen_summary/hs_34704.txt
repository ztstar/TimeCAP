Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a warming day. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, remaining extremely high until midday, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a higher level, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with calm conditions in the pre-dawn period, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a damp, stable night to a warmer, more dynamic daytime pattern, with the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day as moist air continues to build.
