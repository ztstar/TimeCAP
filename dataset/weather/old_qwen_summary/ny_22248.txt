Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature gradually increased during the day, suggesting a warming trend in the lower atmosphere, which may enhance instability and the potential for precipitation. Humidity levels rose significantly, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, peaking above 85%, which increases the likelihood of fog or precipitation. Wind speeds remained relatively constant throughout most of the period, but a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then to a southerly-southeasterly flow suggests changing air mass dynamics, possibly bringing in moist, unstable air. These combined indicators point to a developing storm system with increasing chances of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
