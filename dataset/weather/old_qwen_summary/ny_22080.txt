Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure has been observed, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature has gradually increased throughout the day, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels have risen significantly, peaking in the overnight hours, which enhances the perception of mugginess and increases the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds have remained moderate, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that has intensified in the early morning, suggesting a strengthening frontal influence. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest by dawn points to a developing storm system, likely bringing rain or showers in the near term.
