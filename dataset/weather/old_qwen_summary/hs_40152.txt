Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought increased humidity and stable conditions. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, peaking near dawn, which, combined with the temperature dip, created a high likelihood of fog or mist formation. Wind speeds remained generally light during the night but increased notably in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass. The return to higher pressure and declining humidity in the evening suggests improving conditions, though residual moisture and lingering wind may support localized brief showers.
