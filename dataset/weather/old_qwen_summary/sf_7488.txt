Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking during the late afternoon before dropping significantly overnight. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching near-saturation levels during the early morning hours, which suggests a high likelihood of fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike during the early morning, indicating the passage of a strong high-pressure system, which typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds diminished to minimal levels during the night, with winds shifting from westerly to more southerly and then easterly directions, reflecting a change in atmospheric circulation. These patterns together suggest a transition toward clearer skies and improved visibility later in the day, though lingering fog may persist near coastal areas.
