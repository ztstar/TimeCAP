Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated through the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, only to spike again in the late evening, indicating possible fog formation or a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, but a notable drop occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate and generally steady during the night, weakening through the early morning before increasing again in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, weakening pressure, and shifting wind patterns—suggest the potential for foggy conditions and unsettled weather in the coming hours.
