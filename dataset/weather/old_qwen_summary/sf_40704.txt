Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels spiked during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours was followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a weather front, potentially associated with a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more southerly directions, with increasing speeds in the afternoon, likely driven by pressure gradients and coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, cooling, and developing afternoon breezes—typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with implications for visibility, travel, and outdoor activities.
