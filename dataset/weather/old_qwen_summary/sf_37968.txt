Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with notable drops during the night and early morning, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind conditions showed a shift in direction from southerly to easterly and then to more variable and generally weaker flows later in the day, consistent with changing synoptic influences. These combined factors point to a transition period influenced by marine layer dynamics, likely enhancing fog formation overnight and contributing to cool, damp conditions in the morning.
