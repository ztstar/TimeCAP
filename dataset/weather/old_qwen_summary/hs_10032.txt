Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cooling event likely tied to a passing frontal system. Humidity levels remained near saturation in the early hours before declining sharply, suggesting the onset of drier air as the front moved through. A marked decrease in atmospheric pressure coincided with the temperature dip, confirming the influence of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly easterly to more variable, with increased gustiness and a reversal in direction during the late night, pointing to changing synoptic-scale flow. These indicators collectively suggest a recent passage of a frontal boundary, with potential for lingering instability and possible showers or thunderstorms as the system clears.
