Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before gradually warming toward the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the early morning, indicating the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, consistent with deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds remained light during the overnight hours but increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, suggesting a change in airflow associated with the passing front. These combined trends point to a transition from a cold, damp night to a potentially stormy afternoon, with the possibility of precipitation and stronger winds as the system moves through the region.
