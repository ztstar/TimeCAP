Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a noticeable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the late night and early morning, then declined sharply as temperatures increased, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased progressively from dawn through mid-afternoon, accompanied by a consistent change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, reinforcing the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined trends suggest the potential for precipitation and stormy conditions later in the day or overnight.
