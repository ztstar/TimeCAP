- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half, suggesting growing influenza activity. A clear peak occurred in the 16th week, followed by a significant decline, indicating a potential waning of the current respiratory illness surge. The pattern reflects a typical seasonal epidemic curve, with implications for healthcare system preparedness and the need for continued surveillance and public health response.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a steep upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid and sustained increase in influenza A positivity, likely signaling the onset and peak of a significant seasonal outbreak. A sharp decline is observed in the final five weeks, with a notable drop following the peak, suggesting the end of the surge phase and potential waning of the epidemic. The pattern indicates a classic epidemic curve with a strong seasonal component, warranting continued surveillance to detect any resurgence or shifts in transmission dynamics.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained and steep upward trend over the past 20 weeks, reflecting a significant increase in influenza B activity, with the most pronounced growth occurring in the final 10 weeks. A clear turning point is evident around week 11, where the rate of increase accelerates sharply, suggesting the onset of a major outbreak or epidemic phase. The subsequent decline in the last few weeks, while still remaining at elevated levels, indicates a possible peak and early descent, potentially signaling the waning phase of the current flu season.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a sharp increase in influenza positivity that peaked in the latter half of the period, suggesting intense community transmission. A notable decline follows the peak, indicating a post-epidemic decrease in cases, though levels remain elevated compared to earlier weeks. This pattern signals a typical influenza season trajectory with a delayed but pronounced peak, implying ongoing public health vigilance and potential strain on healthcare resources.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the final quarter, suggesting a significant and growing burden of Influenza A in respiratory specimens. A peak was reached in the 16th week, followed by a notable decline, indicating possible waning of the current wave or seasonal shift. The rapid rise and subsequent drop imply a concentrated outbreak with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the need for timely public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final eight weeks, indicating a significant and intensifying influenza B activity. A clear peak was reached in the most recent weeks, followed by a slight stabilization, suggesting the potential onset of a plateau or early decline in prevalence. This pattern implies heightened community transmission and underscores the need for targeted public health surveillance, vaccination efforts, and healthcare preparedness to mitigate potential strain on resources.
