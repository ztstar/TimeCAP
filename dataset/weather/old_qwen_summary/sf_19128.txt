Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation in the late night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement, though slight drops were observed toward the end of the period. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase during the mid-to-late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, hinting at a change in local atmospheric circulation. These conditions collectively point to a stable, damp, and gradually warming environment, which may contribute to fog formation or low cloud cover, especially during the overnight hours.
