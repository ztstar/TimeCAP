Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp spike in the early morning hours followed by a pronounced drop during the day, suggesting a transition from foggy or moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late morning and remaining elevated, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with calm periods dominating, particularly during the night and early morning, though brief bursts of wind occurred in the afternoon and evening, likely tied to changing pressure gradients. The wind direction shifted from northwest to southwest and then towards the southeast, reflecting dynamic air flow patterns possibly linked to local topography and synoptic influences.
