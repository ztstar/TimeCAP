Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to persistent fog or low cloud cover and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the evening, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from southerly to easterly and later westerly flows, suggesting changing air mass dynamics and possible storm development potential. The combination of high moisture, rising pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition toward more stable but potentially humid conditions, with a low risk of precipitation in the immediate hours ahead.
