Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before showing a slight decrease during the afternoon, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure exhibited a downward trend, particularly in the late night and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system, increasing the likelihood of unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low and stable, with directional shifts indicating variable flow, including a notable change from southerly to westerly and then easterly directions, which could reflect the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Together, these patterns suggest an unstable atmospheric environment, potentially leading to increased chances of precipitation or thunderstorms later in the day.
