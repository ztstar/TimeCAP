Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable shift in air pressure occurred midday, with a sharp increase followed by sustained high pressure, suggesting the influence of a stabilizing high-pressure system. Wind patterns showed a consistent shift from southerly to easterly and later westerly directions, with increasing speeds in the evening, potentially signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions together suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a more variable and possibly unsettled pattern, with implications for afternoon thunderstorm development.
