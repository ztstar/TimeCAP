Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation and persisting at high levels, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, stabilizing at a high reading by mid-morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clear and calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a notable lull around dawn, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the west and northwest, which may signal a shift in air mass. The combination of high humidity, low wind, and cooling temperatures points to a strong marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely resulting in persistent fog and cool conditions, especially in lower-lying and coastal areas.
