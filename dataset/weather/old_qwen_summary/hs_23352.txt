Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to more stable daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining through the afternoon, suggesting increased moisture availability overnight likely due to nocturnal condensation or air mass changes. Air pressure showed a consistent high reading until mid-morning, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening frontal system or low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained low throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly, reflecting changing circulation patterns that could influence moisture transport. Overall, the data suggest a transitional weather pattern with decreasing pressure and shifting winds, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
