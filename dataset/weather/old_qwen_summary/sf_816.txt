Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then began a notable decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather pattern. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with a brief lull around dawn, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and southwest, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind direction points to a potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
