Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, reaching and maintaining saturation levels for much of the night and early morning, indicating strong moisture presence in the atmosphere. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a slow rise in the afternoon, suggesting a diurnal pattern typical of coastal areas influenced by marine air. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds remained low initially but increased in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south and eventually southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined conditions suggest a high probability of fog or drizzle, particularly in the early morning hours, and a potential for unsettled weather as the low-pressure system continues to influence the region.
