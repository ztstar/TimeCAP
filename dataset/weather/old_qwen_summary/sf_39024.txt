Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought increased cloud cover and light precipitation. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing before increasing again in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from coastal to more easterly and southerly sectors. These conditions indicate a transition from a stable, fog-prone marine layer to a more dynamic and variable regime, with potential for clearing skies and improving visibility in the coming hours.
