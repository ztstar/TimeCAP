Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity surged during the early hours, peaking at near saturation levels, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system maintaining fair conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, possibly linked to shifting local circulation patterns. The directional variability in wind, especially the shift from southerly to northerly and westerly flows, hints at changing air mass dynamics that could precede a weather change.
