- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with steady growth in testing volume, peaking in the middle of the period before a gradual decline. The most notable increase occurred in the final third of the timeframe, signaling heightened respiratory activity, followed by a significant but expected decrease in recent weeks. This pattern suggests a seasonal surge in influenza activity that may be subsiding, warranting continued surveillance to detect potential resurgence or emerging strains.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a steep upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid surge in influenza activity, likely signaling the onset and peak of a significant seasonal outbreak. A pronounced peak occurred in the 15th week, followed by a sharp decline in the subsequent weeks, indicating a sustained but waning phase of the outbreak. The sustained high levels of positivity through the peak and the magnitude of the decline suggest strong seasonal influenza transmission, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the need for continued surveillance and public health preparedness.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and sharp increase in positive specimens, transitioning from moderate levels to a peak in the latter half of the observed period, signaling a significant surge in influenza B activity. A notable inflection point occurred around week 13, followed by a steady climb to a peak, suggesting the onset of a strong seasonal wave. The subsequent decline in the final weeks indicates potential waning of the outbreak, though levels remain substantially elevated, underscoring continued public health concern and the need for ongoing surveillance and intervention.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the initial 16 weeks, indicating progressive community transmission of influenza, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half of the period. A peak was reached around week 17, followed by a notable decline in the subsequent weeks, suggesting the possible waning of the current influenza wave. The observed pattern is consistent with a typical seasonal influenza outbreak, with potential implications for healthcare system preparedness and the timing of public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and steep upward trajectory over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza A positivity, indicative of a growing outbreak. After reaching a peak, the value began a pronounced decline, suggesting the epidemic may be waning, with a return to more moderate levels in recent weeks. This pattern aligns with typical seasonal influenza dynamics, highlighting the need for continued surveillance to detect any resurgence or shift in viral activity.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator has shown a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final eight weeks, indicating a significant and progressive increase in influenza B positivity. The data reveals a clear peak in recent weeks, followed by stabilization at a high level, suggesting the onset and persistence of a strong influenza B circulation phase. This pattern strongly implies heightened community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting increased surveillance and preparedness efforts.
