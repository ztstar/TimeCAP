Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the middle of the night before declining slightly during the late afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase to moderate levels, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, pointing to a change in the flow pattern. These combined trends suggest the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially reducing the likelihood of convective activity but also possibly contributing to a prolonged period of warm, humid conditions as the system settles.
