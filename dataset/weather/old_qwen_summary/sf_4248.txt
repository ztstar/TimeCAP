Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight drop in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of atmospheric stability with possible changes in air mass. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast and later to southwest, signaling a potential change in local wind patterns. These conditions suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and calm night to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic afternoon and evening, which may influence visibility, comfort levels, and the likelihood of fog dissipation.
