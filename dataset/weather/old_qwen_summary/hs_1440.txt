Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for elevated heat stress. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, contributing to a muggy feel, before dropping during midday, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or the influence of dry air intrusion. Air pressure showed a steady decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and thunderstorm potential. Winds increased in speed and shifted toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with inflow associated with a developing weather disturbance. These combined factors point to an elevated risk of afternoon or evening thunderstorms, with warm, moist air feeding into a dynamic system as the day progressed.
