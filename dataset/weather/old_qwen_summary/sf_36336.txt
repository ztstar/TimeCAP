Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend occurred, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation during the early morning, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increase in moisture and reduced visibility. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics consistent with frontal passage. These conditions collectively point to a transition period in San Francisco's weather, likely involving the arrival of marine layer influence and potential for overcast skies or light drizzle.
