Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late evening, peaking toward the end of the period, which may contribute to damp or foggy conditions. Air pressure exhibited a sharp fluctuation, with a notable spike during midday, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, followed by a steady decline, signaling potential incoming unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather patterns, likely bringing cooler, potentially wetter conditions in the near term.
