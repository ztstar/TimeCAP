Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or mist formation during low-temperature periods. Air pressure showed a declining pattern toward the end of the period, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, possibly signaling changing air mass influences. Together, these trends suggest a transition toward potentially stormy conditions, with increasing instability due to moisture accumulation and atmospheric pressure changes.
