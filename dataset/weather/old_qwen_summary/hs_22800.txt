Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and maintaining elevated values, which contributes to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure remained stable for most of the day before a slight decline in the late evening, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent, with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east-southeast, aligning with a prevailing maritime flow that often influences Houston’s weather patterns. Together, these indicators point to a stable, humid atmosphere with potential for increasing instability later, possibly leading to afternoon thunderstorms.
