Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, stabilizing at a higher level before slowly declining, reflecting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or a developing convective system. Combined, these trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and increasing wind activity raising the likelihood of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
