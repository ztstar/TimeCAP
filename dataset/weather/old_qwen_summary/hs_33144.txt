Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the afternoon, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely associated with nocturnal cooling. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the nighttime, remaining elevated through the early morning before a gradual decrease, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions overnight. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent through the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, implying possible changes in airflow patterns linked to a developing weather front. The combination of rising humidity, decreasing wind, and stable pressure in the late evening may increase the likelihood of fog or low clouds, potentially affecting visibility and morning commute conditions.
