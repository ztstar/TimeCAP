Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, followed by a sharp rise, indicating the passage of a weather front that likely brought precipitation. Humidity levels reached saturation at multiple points, particularly during the early morning and late evening, suggesting conditions conducive to fog or light precipitation. Temperature trends show a gradual warming, especially in the afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a milder air mass after a cooler onset. Wind patterns exhibited variability in direction, with a notable increase in speed and a shift toward more easterly and southerly flows in the latter part of the period, potentially enhancing moisture transport. Together, these indicators suggest a transition from a cool, damp phase to a more stable, slightly warmer regime, with lingering chances of light showers or fog in the immediate hours ahead.
