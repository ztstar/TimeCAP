Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred in the late afternoon, indicating the onset of warmer conditions, likely due to increasing solar insolation and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting nighttime condensation or fog formation, followed by a steady decline into drier conditions during the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a notable increase in the midday hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and improved weather. Wind speeds were minimal throughout most of the period, with a brief lull in the early morning hours, followed by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, indicating a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition toward a drier, more stable atmosphere, which could lead to improved visibility and comfortable conditions later in the day.
