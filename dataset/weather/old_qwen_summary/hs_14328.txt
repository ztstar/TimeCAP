Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely contributing to a damp and muggy feel during the overnight period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, though a slight dip occurred in the late evening, hinting at possible approaching atmospheric changes. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased during the day, with winds shifting from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly directions, indicating a change in air mass patterns. These combined conditions point toward a transition in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for unstable air and the development of afternoon thunderstorms.
