Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating and changing air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the overnight hours, then declined rapidly in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air, possibly associated with a passing front or subsidence. Air pressure remained relatively stable until mid-afternoon, when it began to decrease, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were light and consistent through the morning and early afternoon, but increased notably in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined trends suggest the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate beneath the weakening pressure system.
