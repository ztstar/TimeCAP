Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of a moist boundary layer conducive to fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift toward more southerly wind directions, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. The wind patterns show a transition from variable to more consistent southeasterly flow, potentially indicating the influence of a developing sea breeze or a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.
