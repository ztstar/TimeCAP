Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before decreasing, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as daytime progressed. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a brief lull around midday, followed by a notable increase in the late evening, suggesting a possible change in atmospheric circulation. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then northerly, which may reflect the influence of a passing frontal system or local topographic effects. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and changing wind patterns suggests a transition from a stable, marine-influenced regime to a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
