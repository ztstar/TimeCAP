Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, reaching and maintaining saturation levels for much of the night and early morning, which likely contributed to dense fog formation. Temperature steadily declined through the early hours, indicating a cooling trend that peaked during the pre-dawn hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a minor rise followed by a drop toward the end of the period, suggesting the passage of a weak weather front or shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, indicating a change in local wind patterns possibly linked to coastal influences. These combined conditions point to a typical marine layer event, with coastal fog and cool, moist air dominating the region, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate during the overnight and early morning hours.
