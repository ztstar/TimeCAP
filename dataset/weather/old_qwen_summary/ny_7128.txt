Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early hours and again in the late evening, indicating possible moisture influx or localized condensation events. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the morning and late evening, likely associated with shifting air masses or localized turbulence. The wind direction varied widely, with consistent southerly and easterly flows in the evening and early morning, hinting at the movement of a frontal boundary or marine air intrusion.
