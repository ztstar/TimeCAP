Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the night and early morning before rising sharply in the late afternoon, peaking in the evening before dropping again, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent decline in the middle of the period, reaching a low point before rebounding significantly, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light throughout, with brief periods of calm and intermittent shifts in wind direction, including a marked change toward the northeast and southeast in the evening, which may signal a change in local wind patterns. Together, these indicators suggest a dynamic transition in the atmosphere, possibly linked to a coastal breeze or frontal influence, with implications for fog formation and temperature variability in the region.
