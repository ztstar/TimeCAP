Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, with the coolest conditions occurring in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before beginning a slow decline, indicating high moisture content in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent drop throughout the day, culminating in a notable decrease in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the night, particularly from the south to southwest sectors, suggesting the influence of a developing circulation pattern. These conditions together suggest the potential for unstable weather, including increased chances of thunderstorms, especially in the afternoon or evening hours.
