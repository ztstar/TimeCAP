Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during midday, which may indicate the influence of a passing front or localized convective activity. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a weather system, which was later followed by a slight recovery, consistent with dynamic atmospheric changes. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief but significant surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more southerly and westerly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially setting the stage for unstable, storm-prone conditions later in the day.
