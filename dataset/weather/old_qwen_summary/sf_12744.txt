Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with sustained high values overnight and a sharp drop in the midday hours, suggesting the influence of maritime air masses and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure exhibited a marked rise in the early hours, peaking mid-morning before a steady decline, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the early morning, with strong, persistent winds from the west and northwest, likely enhancing coastal mixing and contributing to the cooling effect. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and northeast in the late evening, combined with a drop in pressure and rising humidity, hints at the potential for developing fog or overcast conditions later in the night.
