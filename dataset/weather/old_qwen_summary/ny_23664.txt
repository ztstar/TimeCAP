Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. A notable decrease in air pressure during the early hours signaled the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds remained low initially but increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest a transition from cool, humid, and calm conditions to a more dynamic and potentially stormy environment later in the day.
