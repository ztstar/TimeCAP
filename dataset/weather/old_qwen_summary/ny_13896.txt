Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a cooling pattern overnight followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting a developing thermal gradient that may promote convection. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking before dropping sharply in the midday, which could signal the passage of a front and the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, consistent with storm development associated with the lowering pressure. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast in the final hours suggests a possible change in air mass, potentially bringing cooler and drier conditions later.
