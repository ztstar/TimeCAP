Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a shift from a stable nocturnal period to a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A significant drop in humidity occurred in the afternoon, coinciding with rising temperatures and increased wind speeds, pointing toward a drying trend and potential clearing of low-level clouds. Wind patterns shifted from light, consistent flow from the northwest to stronger, more variable winds from the west and south, which may have facilitated the influx of drier air and influenced local convection. Combined, these changes suggest a transition from a stable, humid nighttime regime to a more unstable, drier daytime environment, which could increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift persist.
