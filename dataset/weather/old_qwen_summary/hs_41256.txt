Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to condensation or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning but showed a slight downward trend in the late afternoon and evening, which could signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate and generally increased during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south, consistent with a developing onshore flow that often brings moisture into the region. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover or the development of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability persists.
