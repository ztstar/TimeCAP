Temperature fluctuated significantly over the past 24 hours, dropping steadily through the night before gradually rising during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the afternoon and evening hours, suggesting drier air following a period of higher moisture earlier in the day. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, peaking in the midday hours before stabilizing, which typically signals improving weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low except for brief spikes in the early morning and late afternoon, with directional shifts suggesting changing air currents, particularly a shift toward the northeast in the latter part of the day. Overall, the data points to a transition from a cooler, more humid overnight period to a drier, warming day, with stabilizing pressure indicating a likely improvement in weather conditions.
