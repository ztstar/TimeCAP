Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, then declined sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, reaching a peak before declining slightly, which may signal the approach or passage of a high-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and eventually easterly, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity.
