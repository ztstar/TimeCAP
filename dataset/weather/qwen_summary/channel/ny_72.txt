- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a prolonged period of near-saturation, with extended intervals of consistently high readings, suggesting a stable, moist air mass influencing the region. A notable decline occurred in the latter half of the period, with values dropping significantly before rebounding sharply, indicating a possible shift in air mass or localized weather dynamics. This fluctuation pattern implies the potential for developing precipitation or changing atmospheric conditions, warranting attention for short-term forecasting and public advisories.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has shown a sustained period of stability followed by a gradual decline over the last 24 hours, indicating a possible approach of a low-pressure system. The initial plateau at a high baseline was disrupted by a continuous drop, culminating in a marked decrease, which often precedes deteriorating weather conditions such as precipitation or storm development. This trend suggests increasing atmospheric instability and potential for changing weather, warranting attention for possible impacts on local weather patterns.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature trend shows a steady decline during the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually recovering through the day. A distinct inflection point occurs around midday, followed by a sustained increase that peaks in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal pattern likely influenced by solar heating. The final reading suggests a return to near-morning levels, implying a stabilization or slight cooling trend as the day progresses.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speeds remained consistently low during the initial and middle phases of the 24-hour period, indicating a period of calm conditions with minimal atmospheric movement. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the latter half, peaking mid-cycle before stabilizing with fluctuating but moderate values, suggesting the influence of a developing or passing weather system. The abrupt shift from near-still to elevated wind levels implies a transition in local atmospheric dynamics, potentially signaling changing weather patterns such as approaching fronts or shifting pressure gradients.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Over the past 24 hours, wind direction remained consistently stable in the northeastern quadrant for the first 13 hours, suggesting a prolonged period of steady airflow from that sector. A significant shift occurred around the 14th hour, with wind direction rapidly transitioning through multiple quadrants, culminating in a strong southerly component, indicating a notable change in atmospheric pressure patterns or storm influence. This abrupt directional change implies possible passage of a frontal system, which could lead to evolving weather conditions such as precipitation or temperature shifts in the coming hours.
