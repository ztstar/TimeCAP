Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds during the early hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds intensified through the night and early morning, with gusts reaching strong levels, particularly from the south and southeast, suggesting the passage of a frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly later in the day, accompanied by a drop in humidity and pressure, points to the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass, potentially signaling a transition to more settled conditions.
