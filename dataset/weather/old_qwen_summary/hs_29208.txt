Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling the approach of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon, reaching strong levels, likely driven by the pressure gradient associated with the approaching weather disturbance. These combined factors point to an evolving weather pattern with increasing instability, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
