Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable for much of the day but spiked significantly in the late night and early morning, indicating possible fog formation or increased moisture availability. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night, culminating in a low at dawn, which may suggest the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of calm and intermittent shifts in wind direction, particularly around dawn and midday, hinting at localized atmospheric changes. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, potentially involving the development of marine layer fog or the influence of a developing low-pressure system affecting the region.
