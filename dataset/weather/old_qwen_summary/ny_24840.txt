Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the morning and gradually declining through the night before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the development of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, suggesting the influence of a strengthening frontal system. These combined factors point to an active weather pattern, potentially leading to precipitation and overcast conditions in the near term.
