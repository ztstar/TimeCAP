Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, which may have contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure increased notably during the night and remained high into the morning, indicating stable atmospheric conditions associated with a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate initially but decreased significantly overnight, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, suggesting a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing winds, and moderate temperatures suggests improving weather conditions with clearer skies expected in the near term.
