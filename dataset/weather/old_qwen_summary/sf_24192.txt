Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight and in the early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the evening, indicating a shift in air mass characteristics. Air pressure showed sustained high values through most of the night and morning, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the evening, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and marine influence. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition from stable marine layer conditions to more dynamic, potentially unsettled weather later in the day.
