Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred throughout the night, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast, aligning with a developing onshore flow that often enhances moisture and storm potential. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests an elevated risk of thunderstorms, particularly during the late evening and overnight hours.
