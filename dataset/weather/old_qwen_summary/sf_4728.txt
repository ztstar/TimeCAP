Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then sharply dropped during the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather.
