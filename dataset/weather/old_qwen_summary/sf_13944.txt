Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, indicating a shift from foggy, moist conditions to drier air. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by strong winds from the west and southwest, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or a change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the midday and early evening, with sustained gusts in the late afternoon, likely enhancing coastal mixing and dispersing fog. These dynamics point to a transition period in the local weather, with conditions shifting from a cool, fog-prone regime toward a drier, windier, and potentially more variable environment.
