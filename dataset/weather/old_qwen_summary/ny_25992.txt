Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler, stable period to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, remaining high through the night before plummeting in the mid-to-late morning, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure build-up. These combined trends point to a transitioning weather regime, with improving conditions and reduced precipitation risk, favorable for outdoor activities in New York City.
