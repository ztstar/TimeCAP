Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a damp and heavy feel, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling a possible approaching weather system, although pressure stabilized later in the evening. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition in weather patterns, potentially indicating the arrival of a frontal system with possible precipitation later in the day.
