Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking in the overnight hours and remaining elevated through the early morning before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with a notable drop during the mid-night period, followed by a gradual rise, indicating possible passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions persisting through the night, before increasing slightly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could contribute to enhanced convective potential later in the day.
