Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a stable yet evolving meteorological pattern characterized by persistent high humidity and gradual temperature fluctuations. A notable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Air pressure remained relatively high and steady, with a minor dip toward the end of the period, indicating a weakening high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, transitioning from moderate breezes to near-calm conditions, which likely contributed to the accumulation of moisture and fog formation. The shift in wind direction from west-southwest to more southerly and then easterly suggests changing synoptic influences, possibly signaling the approach of a shifting weather system that could bring increased cloud cover or precipitation.
