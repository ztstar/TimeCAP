Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture, particularly during the early morning and late night, indicating possible fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable until late in the day, when a notable drop occurred, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with coastal breeze dynamics and potential storm influence. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these patterns suggest an increasing likelihood of fog, light precipitation, or a change in weather conditions in the coming hours.
