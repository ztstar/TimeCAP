Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning, suggesting a strong influence of nocturnal radiative cooling or an approaching cold front. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early to mid-evening, then dropped sharply in the early morning hours, indicating a shift in air mass that likely brought drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable decrease through the night, followed by a pronounced recovery in the early morning, signaling the passage of a weather system and the arrival of a more stable high-pressure environment. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning hours, particularly from a northerly to westerly direction, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a cooler, drier, and more stable regime, likely leading to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
