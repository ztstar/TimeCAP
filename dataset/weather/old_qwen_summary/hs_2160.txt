Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. A sharp decline in air pressure during the early hours, coinciding with a rise in humidity and wind activity, suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, possibly bringing unsettled weather. The wind direction shifted from northwest to southerly by mid-morning, consistent with warm, moist air advection, which may increase the potential for afternoon thunderstorms. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, creating a high dew point environment that enhances atmospheric instability. With sustained wind speeds and a strengthening warm front moving in, there is a growing likelihood of scattered to isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
