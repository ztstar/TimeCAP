Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with marked spikes during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture intrusion. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to ongoing or developing overcast conditions. Wind patterns were generally light and shifted unpredictably, with brief periods of calm and sudden directional changes, especially during the night, suggesting localized atmospheric instability. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to increased cloud cover and a higher chance of drizzle or fog, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
