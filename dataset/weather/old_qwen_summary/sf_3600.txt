Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion that broke as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking and remaining consistently high through the early morning hours, indicating the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed precipitation and contributed to stable, clear conditions during the afternoon. Wind speeds fluctuated markedly, with strong westerly to southwesterly winds in the early morning giving way to calmer conditions at dawn, followed by a resurgence of moderate to strong winds in the late afternoon—consistent with onshore flow and coastal dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a typical coastal weather cycle, with marine layer development overnight and its dissipation by midday, resulting in cooler mornings and milder, clearer afternoons.
