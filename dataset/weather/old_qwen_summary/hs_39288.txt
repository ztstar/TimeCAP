Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the cooler morning temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with a brief spike in the mid-morning hours, suggesting a passing high-pressure influence, though a subsequent decline may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, potentially aiding in the mixing of air layers and reducing fog persistence. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southwest in the late hours may indicate the onset of a warm, moist air advection, which could lead to unstable conditions and possible afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
