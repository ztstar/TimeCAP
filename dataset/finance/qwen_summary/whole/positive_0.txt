Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a sustained upward trend with minor pullbacks, signaling strong equity market momentum and investor confidence. The VIX has generally declined, reflecting reduced market volatility and a calming sentiment, though a recent uptick suggests renewed caution. Global equity indices like the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have exhibited resilience with moderate gains, indicating broad-based confidence across major markets. Gold and crude oil prices have both trended higher, suggesting inflationary pressures and safe-haven demand, while the U.S. dollar has shown mixed movements, with the euro weakening and the yen stabilizing despite slight fluctuations. The persistent depreciation of the Chinese yuan may signal ongoing monetary easing or export competitiveness concerns, warranting close monitoring for cross-market spillovers.
