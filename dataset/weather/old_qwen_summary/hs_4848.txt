Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and increasing air pressure. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. A notable drop in wind speed during the overnight hours, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, coincided with changes in wind direction, indicating shifting air mass patterns. Air pressure showed a general upward trend during the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and fair conditions. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and consistent high pressure suggests a transition toward warmer, clearer skies, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
