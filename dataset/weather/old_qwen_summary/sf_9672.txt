Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, consistent with the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure showed a slight but steady increase throughout the day, culminating in a notable rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low, with a brief period of calm conditions during the early morning, followed by a return to light winds, which likely contributed to the stagnation of fog and moisture near the surface. Wind direction shifted dramatically in the early morning, transitioning from a westerly to a northeasterly flow, possibly indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow or a local coastal breeze reversal, which may influence the timing and extent of fog clearance.
