Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with a sharp decline in the early hours, followed by a significant spike in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a brief surge, which may have been linked to a passing weather system, though no significant storm activity was observed. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a marked increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, possibly signaling a change in local atmospheric flow. Collectively, these patterns point to a dynamic microclimate influenced by marine layer behavior and coastal wind shifts, typical of San Francisco’s weather, with potential for fog dissipation later in the day.
