Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking and remaining elevated through midday before declining, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to potential instability. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the latter half, which may reflect the influence of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent, with a steady shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, indicating a persistent flow from the Gulf of Mexico, which likely fueled the moisture influx. Combined, these patterns suggest a humid, warming trend with conditions favorable for afternoon thunderstorm development, especially as temperatures continue to rise and humidity lingers.
