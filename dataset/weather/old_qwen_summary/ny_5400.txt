Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of a cold front passing through. Humidity increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the night, then began to drop in the late afternoon, signaling a possible shift toward unsettled weather. Wind speeds were moderate and variable, with a consistent northerly to northwesterly component during the early hours, which may have contributed to the cooling trend. The observed changes in wind direction and pressure suggest an approaching weather system, potentially bringing precipitation or changing conditions in the near future.
