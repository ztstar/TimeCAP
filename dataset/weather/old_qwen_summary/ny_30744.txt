Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rebound in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels declined significantly during the night and early morning, reaching their lowest point before rising slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting dry air masses dominated the overnight period. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with notable gusts in the evening, particularly from the northwest and west, likely enhancing heat loss and contributing to the cooling trend. The shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then southerly suggests a dynamic atmospheric setup, potentially signaling a change in weather patterns, with the possibility of clearer skies and cooler conditions ahead.
