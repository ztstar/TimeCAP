Over the past 24 hours, a sustained cold trend was observed, with temperatures remaining consistently low during the early morning hours before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight and early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which may have contributed to reduced perceptible cold due to the dampening effect. Air pressure exhibited a significant rise during the midday and early evening, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then easterly in the afternoon, suggesting a change in air mass flow that coincided with the pressure increase. Taken together, these indicators suggest a transition toward more stable and dry conditions, with the potential for clearing skies and a gradual warming trend in the coming hours.
