Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation before dropping significantly as temperatures increased, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may signal a transition in weather systems. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the overnight hours to stronger and more consistent southerly and easterly flows during the midday and evening, potentially transporting moisture inland. These combined factors suggest a likely foggy or overcast morning followed by clearing skies and mild temperatures later in the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
