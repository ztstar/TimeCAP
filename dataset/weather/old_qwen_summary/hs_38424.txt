Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking and remaining near saturation before declining slightly in the late evening, indicating the presence of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the early and mid-day, suggesting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the east and then slightly southerly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These trends collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic afternoon, with potential for clearing skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
