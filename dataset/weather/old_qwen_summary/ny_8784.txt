Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperature steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase, possibly due to changing air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the night and dropping sharply in the afternoon, which aligns with the passage of a front and subsequent clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally low except for a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, suggesting a complex pressure gradient change. Overall, these indicators point to the passage of a dynamic weather system, likely bringing precipitation earlier in the period and clearing skies later, with potential for unstable conditions ahead.
