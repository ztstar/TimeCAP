Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked drop in atmospheric pressure, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely brought unsettled conditions. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early morning hours before declining significantly, suggesting the onset of drying as the system evolved. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts observed, particularly from the southeast and south directions, consistent with a strong onshore flow. Temperature fluctuations were minimal, with slight cooling through the night and a gradual warming during the day, reflecting stable thermal conditions despite dynamic wind and pressure changes. These combined factors point to a shift from foggy, damp conditions to a more variable, windy period, potentially increasing the risk of coastal gusts and localized weather changes.
