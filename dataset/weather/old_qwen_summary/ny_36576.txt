Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds diminished notably after midnight, with calm conditions prevailing in the final hours, and wind direction shifted from predominantly northwest to southeast, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. These trends collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, followed by stabilization under a high-pressure ridge, likely leading to improved weather conditions with reduced cloud cover and lower precipitation risk.
