Temperature showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, hinting at possible changing weather patterns.
