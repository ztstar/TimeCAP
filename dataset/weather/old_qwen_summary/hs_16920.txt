Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the transition from nocturnal low temperatures to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, before decreasing significantly during the afternoon as air warmed and moisture content dropped. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting the potential approach of a low-pressure system or shifting weather pattern. Wind speeds remained generally light except for brief increases in the late afternoon and early evening, with wind directions shifting from southerly and westerly to more easterly, possibly signaling a change in airflow due to evolving synoptic conditions. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and fluctuating wind patterns suggests a potential for unstable conditions later in the day, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms.
