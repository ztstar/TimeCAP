Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions. A significant drop in humidity occurred during midday, coinciding with a rise in wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from northerly to more westerly and southerly sectors. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and consistent afternoon winds indicates a transition toward clearer and drier conditions, likely improving visibility and comfort levels.
