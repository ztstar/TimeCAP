Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-afternoon, which suggests moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight rise in the afternoon, signaling the presence of a high-pressure system that generally supports fair weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief spike in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, possibly indicating a change in air mass. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid overnight period to a milder, potentially clearer daytime, although localized fog or drizzle cannot be ruled out due to high humidity and variable wind patterns.
