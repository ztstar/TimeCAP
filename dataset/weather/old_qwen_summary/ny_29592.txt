Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before gradually rising in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by a weak warming phase. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to overnight cooling and potential fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, potentially indicating a change in air mass. Collectively, these indicators point to a transition toward clearer skies and more settled conditions, with a gradual improvement in overall weather stability.
