Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the city’s marine layer. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather system, likely a frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low through the night but increased substantially in the late evening, particularly from the south and southeast, potentially signaling a shift in airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, variable wind direction, and fluctuating pressure points to a dynamic coastal atmosphere, likely contributing to persistent fog and cooler conditions in the urban core.
