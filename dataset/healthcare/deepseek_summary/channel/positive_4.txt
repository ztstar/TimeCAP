- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in testing volume, reflecting increasing respiratory activity and heightened surveillance or disease prevalence. A notable acceleration in the rate of increase is observed in the final eight weeks, suggesting a potential surge in influenza circulation, possibly entering or nearing peak season. The slight decline in the most recent week, despite the overall upward trajectory, may indicate a potential stabilization or early sign of plateauing, warranting close monitoring to determine if this represents a temporary fluctuation or the beginning of a downward trend.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a steep and sustained upward trajectory over the past 18 weeks, signaling a significant surge in influenza A activity, with the most pronounced growth occurring in the final weeks. A sharp peak was reached in the 19th week, followed by a notable decline in the 20th week, suggesting a possible stabilization or waning of the current outbreak. This pattern indicates a rapidly escalating epidemic phase followed by potential early signs of a downturn, which may reflect the natural course of seasonal influenza or the impact of public health interventions.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The data reveals a sustained and accelerating upward trend in influenza B positivity, with a sharp increase in the latter half of the observation period, indicating a significant surge in respiratory transmission. The most pronounced growth occurs between weeks 14 and 18, followed by a notable peak and subsequent decline, suggesting a possible peak in the current influenza season. This pattern implies heightened public health concern, warranting intensified surveillance, preparedness for healthcare system strain, and potential prioritization of vaccination and antiviral resources.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in the latter half, signaling a significant surge in influenza activity. The peak occurred in the 18th week, followed by a notable decline in the most recent week, suggesting a possible waning of the current wave or the onset of post-peak dynamics. This pattern indicates a growing respiratory burden that may strain healthcare resources, warranting continued surveillance and preparedness for potential resurgence.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked inflection point occurring around week 15, followed by a sharp rise to a peak before a subsequent decline. The progression indicates a significant and growing burden of influenza A activity, consistent with a seasonal epidemic peak, followed by a possible waning phase. The high values in the final weeks suggest ongoing transmission, though the drop from the peak may signal the potential onset of epidemic decline or a shift in surveillance dynamics.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a steady upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final seven weeks, suggesting a significant increase in influenza B activity. The data reveals a sharp rise from moderate levels to peak values, indicating the onset and progression of a substantial respiratory virus surge. This pattern aligns with seasonal influenza dynamics and implies heightened public health concern, necessitating enhanced surveillance, preparedness, and potential intervention efforts.
