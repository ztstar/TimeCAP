Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity reached near-saturated levels during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low stratus clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure in the late evening and early morning was accompanied by increased wind speeds and shifting wind directions, pointing to an approaching weather system or a change in local wind patterns. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly in the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in synoptic conditions, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or frontal passage. These combined factors imply that the city is transitioning through a period of variable and potentially unstable weather, with a heightened chance of fog dissipation and clearer skies later in the day.
