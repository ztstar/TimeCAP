Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained largely stable with a minor drop toward the end of the period, suggesting a sustained high-pressure system with no immediate change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with near-zero conditions during the night, but increased slightly in the late afternoon, potentially aiding in the dissipation of fog as the day progressed. Wind direction shifted progressively from the northwest to the west-southwest, consistent with typical coastal flow patterns, reinforcing the influence of the Pacific Ocean on local weather dynamics.
