Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning and remained near saturation, suggesting high moisture content in the air, which can contribute to discomfort and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined, reaching a low point before slightly rebounding, signaling the approach or passage of a low-pressure system that often brings unstable weather. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable reduction during the night, while wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly and then to westerly, indicating changing airstreams associated with a developing weather disturbance. These conditions collectively suggest an increased likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain, particularly in the late evening and overnight hours.
