Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low-level moisture, before rising again in the evening, likely due to increased moisture advection or condensation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase toward the end of the period, driven by shifting wind direction from the north to the west, potentially signaling the arrival of a marine layer surge. These dynamics suggest a transition from a stable, dry nocturnal regime to a more dynamic, moist air mass, which may lead to fog or low clouds developing overnight.
