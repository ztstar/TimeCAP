Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog or dew formation and contributed to a muggy feel. A steady drop in air pressure during the late night and early morning, particularly around the time of peak humidity, points to a developing low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted significantly overnight, with a transition from light, variable winds to stronger, more persistent southerly and southeasterly flows in the afternoon, potentially signaling inflow of moist air. These combined factors—high moisture, falling pressure, and shifting winds—indicate a high probability of scattered thunderstorms or heavy showers later in the day, especially as temperatures begin to rise again.
