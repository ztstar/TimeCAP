Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure has been observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature gradually increased during the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, reflecting a warming trend followed by a gradual evening drop. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, then sharply decreased, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air, likely due to a change in wind patterns. Wind speeds intensified notably in the evening, with a peak in the late night, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, indicating dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined indicators suggest the onset of a frontal passage, potentially bringing unsettled conditions such as precipitation and stronger gusts in the near term.
