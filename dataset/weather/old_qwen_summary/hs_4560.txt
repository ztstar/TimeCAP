Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking at saturation, which suggests a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, indicating the possible passage of a frontal system. The sustained high wind speeds and pressure decline point to dynamic atmospheric conditions that could lead to thunderstorm development later in the day. These indicators together suggest a high probability of unstable weather, including potential showers or storms, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.
