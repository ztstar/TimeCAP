Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming, indicating the influence of changing air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning before moderating slightly, suggesting the presence of moist air and possibly the onset of precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the afternoon, which is a strong indicator of an approaching low-pressure system or storm front. Wind speeds remained consistently low, but wind direction shifted notably from southerly to westerly and then to more southerly-southwesterly, hinting at the rotation of the low-pressure system. Given the combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and shifting winds, New York City is likely experiencing conditions conducive to rain or storms in the near term.
