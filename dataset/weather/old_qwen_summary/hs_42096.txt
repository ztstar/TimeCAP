Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by solar radiation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to reduced ventilation and cooler surface temperatures. Air pressure showed a gradual decline in the afternoon and evening, culminating in a low-pressure signal that may indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally low during the night but increased during the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, suggesting changing flow patterns likely associated with a developing frontal influence. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term as the system evolves.
