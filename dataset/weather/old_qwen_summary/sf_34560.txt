Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, contributing to a damp, foggy atmosphere, before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a clearing trend. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather system that may have brought the fog and cooler conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with consistent westerly to northwesterly winds initially, shifting to more southerly and easterly directions later, which likely influenced the movement and dissipation of fog. These patterns collectively point to a dynamic coastal weather cycle, typical of San Francisco, where marine layer development and offshore wind shifts play a key role in daily conditions.
