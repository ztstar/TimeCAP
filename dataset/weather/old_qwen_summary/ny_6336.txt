Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend occurred overnight, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning hours before gradually rebounding during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of moist air that likely contributed to fog or low visibility during those hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the night, but a notable increase in the late afternoon was followed by a sharp drop in the evening, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, with the potential for unsettled or changing conditions in the coming hours, including possible precipitation or a temperature shift.
