Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a significant spike in the pre-dawn hours, indicating possible nocturnal moisture accumulation, which subsided as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable and slightly stronger winds in the afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southwest to more southerly and westerly sectors. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, consistent with the approach of a high-pressure ridge that may bring continued dry and warmer conditions in the near term.
