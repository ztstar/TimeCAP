Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature fluctuations. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of dew formation or fog, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, muggy feel. A gradual rise in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a plateau and slight decline in the afternoon, signaling a shift from stable, high-pressure conditions to a slightly more dynamic atmospheric regime. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly directions, with speeds generally low but increasing in the late afternoon, possibly indicating the approach of a weak frontal boundary. These combined factors—high humidity, temperature rebound, and changing wind direction—suggest a transition period that could lead to unstable conditions and potential for isolated afternoon thunderstorms.
