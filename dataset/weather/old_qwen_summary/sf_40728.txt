Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early hours, peaking near 93% and remaining elevated, which is consistent with the presence of fog and low clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night, with a sharp increase mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system strengthening over the area. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and evening, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, likely contributing to the dispersion of fog and mixing of air layers. These conditions together suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a clearer, more variable atmosphere, potentially signaling improving visibility and warmer daytime conditions.
