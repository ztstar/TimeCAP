Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-evening, tracking a consistent decline that culminated in a low-pressure system moving through the region, signaling potential for unstable weather. Wind speeds increased markedly during the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a frontal system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
