Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or mist, particularly contributing to poor visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure showed a slight rise during midday, followed by a steady decline, signaling a possible approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, potentially drawing in moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions collectively point to an environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as daytime heating intensifies the instability.
