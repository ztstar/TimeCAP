Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the night and early dawn, suggesting fog formation or low-level moisture accumulation typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with a brief lull and a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late evening, possibly signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These indicators together suggest a transition toward clearer skies and more settled weather, consistent with the arrival of a dry, stable air mass over the bay area.
