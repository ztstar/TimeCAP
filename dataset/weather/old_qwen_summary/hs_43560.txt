Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that peaked during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with notable shifts in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more northerly sectors, suggesting a change in air mass flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward more stable and cooler conditions, potentially reducing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms in the region.
