Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to marine influence and fog development. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, but consistent pressure changes may have contributed to shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal wind dynamics. These conditions point to a persistent marine layer and the potential for fog or low clouds during the morning hours, which could impact visibility and morning commutes.
