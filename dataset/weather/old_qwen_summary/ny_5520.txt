Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning and early afternoon, indicating a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly around dawn. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning and mid-afternoon, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, consistent with frontal activity. Combined, these indicators point to a period of unstable weather, likely associated with a developing or passing storm system, which could result in continued precipitation or overcast conditions in the near term.
