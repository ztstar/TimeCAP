Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity reached peak levels in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, culminating in a low point in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and onshore flow. These conditions point to a typical marine layer pattern, with fog and cool temperatures likely persisting into the early morning hours.
