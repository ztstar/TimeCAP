Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the nighttime hours, followed by a steady warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to a drier, warmer daytime regime. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor increase in the mid-afternoon, which may reflect the influence of a weak high-pressure system or a slow-moving front. Wind speeds were light to moderate during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that likely contributed to moisture transport and the observed humidity patterns. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west in the final hours may signal an approaching change in weather, possibly indicating the onset of a new air mass or a developing disturbance.
