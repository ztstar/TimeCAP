Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating and increasing solar radiation. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or dew formation during cooler periods. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds were moderate during midday and strengthened in the late afternoon, with consistent southerly to easterly flow, potentially enhancing moisture transport and contributing to the humid conditions. Combined with the sustained high humidity and rising temperatures, these trends indicate a high risk of discomfort and potential for isolated thunderstorms if instability develops further.
