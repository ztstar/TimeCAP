Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, especially during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend that may signal the approach of a more stable, warmer air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier conditions, likely due to a change in air flow. Air pressure remained largely stable, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, which typically correlates with improving weather and reduced chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, indicating a change in the prevailing atmospheric circulation pattern. These changes collectively suggest a drying trend following a period of higher moisture, with potentially clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
