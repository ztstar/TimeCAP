Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting potential for fog formation during the cooler hours and increased discomfort during warmer periods. Air pressure showed a slight rise through the early to mid-day, followed by a gradual decline, which may be associated with a passing weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the morning and a consistent pattern of light to moderate winds throughout the day, while wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, indicating changing synoptic flow. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions or an approaching storm system, especially given the high humidity and pressure fluctuations.
