Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a clear cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual warming phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical for the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system that may bring further changes to the weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase during the night and a brief gust during the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing synoptic conditions. These patterns collectively point to a transition period, with the potential for fog or drizzle later in the day as the system evolves.
