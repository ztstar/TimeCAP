Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels were consistently high in the initial phase, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding slightly in the evening, suggesting a shift in moisture content in the air. Air pressure showed a notable decrease through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to westerly, consistent with changing storm dynamics. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced the influence of a passing frontal system, likely bringing precipitation earlier in the cycle and clearing skies with cooler, drier air in the latter part of the period.
