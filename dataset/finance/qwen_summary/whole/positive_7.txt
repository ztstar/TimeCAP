Over the past 20 market days, equity markets displayed a generally bullish trend with notable momentum in the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, despite short-term volatility in the middle period. The VIX exhibited a pronounced spike followed by a sustained decline, indicating a shift from heightened fear to relative calm in investor sentiment. Global equities, particularly in Japan and the UK, showed strong gains mid-period, but recent pullbacks suggest potential profit-taking or risk aversion. Commodity prices, especially gold and crude oil, trended upward with oil reflecting increased supply-demand dynamics, while gold maintained safe-haven appeal amid market uncertainty. Currency movements revealed a weakening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen, with the yuan showing slight depreciation, hinting at broader global macroeconomic shifts and potential monetary policy divergence.
