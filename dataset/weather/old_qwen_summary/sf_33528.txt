Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a pattern of slight increases followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the influence of a shifting weather system, possibly a low-pressure trough moving in. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the late night and early morning, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then southerly, indicating a change in local atmospheric flow. These combined factors point to a transition phase in the weather, likely bringing persistent coastal fog, cooler conditions, and potentially unsettled weather as the system evolves.
