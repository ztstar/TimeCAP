Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at near-saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A steady rise in air pressure was observed, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns that could signal the approach of a more dynamic weather system. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition period, with potential for isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day if moisture continues to accumulate.
