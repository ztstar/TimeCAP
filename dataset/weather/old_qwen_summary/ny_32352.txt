Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours and remaining elevated through midday, indicating a moistening atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, then intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the west-southwest, which is consistent with an approaching frontal system. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southwesterly and then southerly further supports the development of a warm front, potentially leading to precipitation later in the day.
