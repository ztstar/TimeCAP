Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖 through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime patterns. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking and remaining high through mid-morning before a sudden drop, suggesting a possible change in air mass or clearing of moisture. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a sustained high, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction—from predominantly westerly to southerly and then to more variable patterns—pointing to changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, warming temperatures, and shifting winds suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
