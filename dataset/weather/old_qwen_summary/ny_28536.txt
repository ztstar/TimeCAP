Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a cold air mass moving into the region. Humidity levels began moderate, rose sharply in the evening, and then dropped significantly overnight, only to rebound in the early morning, pointing to a cycle of condensation and clearing skies. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, especially in the final hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the northwest and eventually north, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation likely associated with the passing cold front. Taken together, these trends suggest that New York City experienced a transition from mild, humid conditions to cooler, drier, and more stable weather, consistent with the arrival of a cold front and clearing skies.
