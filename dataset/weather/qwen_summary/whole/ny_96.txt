Temperature trends indicate a significant cooling overnight followed by a steady warming through the morning and afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, then dropped sharply during midday before stabilizing, pointing to a transition from saturated air to drier conditions likely due to warming and reduced moisture. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a minimum before gradually recovering, which is indicative of an approaching or passing weather system, possibly a low-pressure front. Wind activity intensified during the late night and early morning, with directional shifts from northwest to southeast, reflecting changing pressure gradients and possible storm development. The combination of falling pressure, rising temperature, and shifting wind patterns implies an evolving atmospheric instability, potentially leading to changing weather conditions in the near term.
