Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of urban environments. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp drop during midday and a notable spike in the late night, suggesting possible changes in air mass or local moisture sources. Air pressure steadily declined through the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly due to frontal influences. These conditions collectively point to a transition period in New York City’s weather, with potential for precipitation or storm development later in the day.
