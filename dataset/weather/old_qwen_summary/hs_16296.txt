Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight increase in the mid-morning hours, possibly signaling the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing airflow patterns possibly linked to a passing front. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with drying conditions and increasing wind activity potentially reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
