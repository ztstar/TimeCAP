Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before a significant drop during midday, indicating the passage of a moisture-laden air mass and subsequent clearing. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds remained generally low, with periods of calm and brief gusts, while wind direction shifted dramatically, reflecting changing flow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions point to a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, sunnier daytime, characteristic of typical coastal fog dissipation and afternoon warming in the region.
