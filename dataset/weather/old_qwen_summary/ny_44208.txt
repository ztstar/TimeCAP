Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to increasingly milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels exhibited a pattern of moderate to high values overnight, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the late afternoon, suggesting a potential shift in air mass or precipitation influence. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a sustained increase during the morning hours hints at the approach of a high-pressure system, likely leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts during the night and early morning, primarily from the south and west, which may have contributed to the overnight cooling. The consistent presence of variable wind directions, particularly from the south and west during key periods, suggests dynamic atmospheric mixing, possibly associated with a frontal passage or local circulation changes.
