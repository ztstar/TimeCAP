Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely due to marine layer development. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly after midnight, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer conditions in the coming hours. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, accompanied by a dramatic shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, indicating a change in local circulation patterns, possibly linked to the onset of a land-breeze or synoptic-scale adjustment. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, which could lead to improving visibility and potential fog dissipation later in the day.
