Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, suggesting a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable weather, though lingering moisture may result in early-morning fog or drizzle.
