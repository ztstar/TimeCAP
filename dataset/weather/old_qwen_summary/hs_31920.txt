Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, before declining significantly as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, suggesting a change in airflow that could facilitate moisture transport. Overall, the data points to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient instability develops.
