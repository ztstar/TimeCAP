Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and increasing solar radiation. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or low clouds, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, signaling the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Stronger winds from the southeast to south-southwest directions in the late afternoon and evening, coupled with a drop in pressure, point to dynamic atmospheric changes that may have facilitated convective activity. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward less stable air, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
