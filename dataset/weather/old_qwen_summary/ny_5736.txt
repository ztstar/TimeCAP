Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature decline occurred during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a pronounced diurnal cooling trend likely associated with clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, particularly during the early morning hours. A notable increase in air pressure during the night and early morning, accompanied by calm wind conditions, points to the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and clear weather. Wind patterns shifted abruptly in the late morning, with a sudden gust from the southwest, likely signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weak frontal boundary. The reemergence of elevated humidity and wind activity in the evening may indicate the potential for light precipitation or overcast conditions later in the day.
