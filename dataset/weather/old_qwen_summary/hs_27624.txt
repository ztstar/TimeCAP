Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the period, with a brief drop in the early hours before rebounding, suggesting the presence of persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable spike midday, followed by a decline, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather system, possibly a front or disturbance. Wind speeds decreased during the night, then increased again in the afternoon, with winds shifting toward the southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. Combined, these indicators suggest a humid, unstable air mass with potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warming continues and moisture remains elevated.
