Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or potential clearing. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily after midday, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with changing atmospheric circulation. These patterns suggest the influence of a developing weather front, potentially bringing instability and the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
