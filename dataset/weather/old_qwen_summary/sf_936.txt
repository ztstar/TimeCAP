Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a notable increase in the early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level fog common in the region. A marked rise in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a brief lull in the middle of the night, followed by stronger, more persistent winds in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest. The shift in wind direction and sustained increase in pressure suggest a transition toward clearer, drier conditions, which may persist into the coming day.
