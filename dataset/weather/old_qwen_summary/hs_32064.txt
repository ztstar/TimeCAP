Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred mid-morning, with winds weakening and changing direction, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or a shift in local circulation. Air pressure showed a slight drop in the late afternoon, followed by stabilization, which may signal the approach or passage of a weather front. The combination of high humidity and warming temperatures in the late evening raises the potential for isolated thunderstorms, particularly if additional lift is introduced.
