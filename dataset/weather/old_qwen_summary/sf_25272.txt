Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with high values in the early morning and late night, dropping significantly during midday and rising again in the evening—consistent with fog formation and dissipation patterns common in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the day before a sharp drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system, potentially bringing changes in conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the south and west, which may have contributed to the dissipation of fog and the mixing of air masses near the surface. The shift in wind direction from maritime southwesterly to more variable and easterly flows hints at a transition in atmospheric circulation, possibly signaling the influence of an approaching frontal boundary or changing synoptic-scale conditions.
