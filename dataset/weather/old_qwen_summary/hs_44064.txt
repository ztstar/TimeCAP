Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a pronounced daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal condensation and subsequent mixing of drier air. Air pressure steadily decreased through the late night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly and eventually to a more easterly flow, potentially indicating a change in local circulation patterns. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition period with increasing instability and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
