Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more comfortable daytime period. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained breezes from the southeast and south, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass. These dynamics collectively point to a shift from a stable, humid nighttime environment to a drier, windier day, with implications for outdoor comfort and possible influence on localized storm development.
