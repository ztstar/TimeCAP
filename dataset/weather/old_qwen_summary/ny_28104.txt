Over the past 24 hours, a steady rise in temperature was observed, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the daytime hours. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and remained high throughout the day, suggesting saturated air conditions that could contribute to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined, reaching a low point in the late afternoon before a slight recovery, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to more northerly and then southerly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Taken together, these indicators point to the influence of a developing low-pressure system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially unstable weather conditions in the near term.
