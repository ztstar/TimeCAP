Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely due to marine layer formation. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period, with a slight increase during the night and early morning, consistent with high-pressure influence suppressing significant weather changes. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, followed by a noticeable increase in the afternoon, driven by a shift toward more southerly wind directions. The consistent wind direction from the southwest to west-southwest throughout the evening and night supports the presence of a persistent marine air flow, reinforcing the likelihood of fog and low clouds in coastal areas.
