Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing heat buildup. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing, which typically signals the approach or passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but intensified in the afternoon and evening, with winds shifting toward a more easterly direction, potentially facilitating the movement of moisture. These combined trends indicate a drying and warming pattern consistent with the influence of a high-pressure ridge, which may suppress precipitation but could also contribute to heat accumulation during the day.
