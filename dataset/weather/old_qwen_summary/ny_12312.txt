Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours before increasing sharply in the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the arrival of moist air or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise, which typically signals the passage of a low-pressure system and possible storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, shifting winds from the southwest and west, consistent with the influence of a developing or passing frontal system. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
