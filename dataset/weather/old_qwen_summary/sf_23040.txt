Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation in the early hours and maintaining near-100% for several hours, indicating persistent fog or low-lying cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring prolonged overcast conditions or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase toward the end of the period, while wind direction shifted from southwest to west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a marine layer-driven weather pattern, likely resulting in cool, damp conditions with limited sunshine and a possibility of light drizzle or fog in the coming hours.
