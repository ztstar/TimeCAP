Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before decreasing during the daytime, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then to the northwest, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition toward clearer skies and drier conditions, with the potential for cooler, more stable weather in the coming hours.
