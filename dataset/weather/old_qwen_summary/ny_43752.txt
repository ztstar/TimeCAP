Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before gradually increasing during the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a stable atmospheric regime. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking mid-morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level before a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief increases in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing flow patterns, possibly related to local topography or boundary layer dynamics. These conditions point to a generally stable and dry weather pattern, with minimal precipitation risk and improving air quality, favorable for outdoor activities during the day.
