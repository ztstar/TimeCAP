Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon and dropping significantly overnight, indicating strong nocturnal heat loss likely driven by clear skies and wind mixing. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and late night, suggesting fog formation or moisture retention, particularly when temperatures dipped near dew point. Air pressure showed a notable rise during midday, followed by a sharp decline in the evening, signaling a shift in atmospheric stability and potential for incoming weather systems. Wind speeds increased substantially during evening hours, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with the influence of offshore flows or sea breeze dynamics, which may have contributed to the cooling and dispersion of fog. The wind direction transitioned from onshore to offshore and back, reflecting complex local patterns influenced by topography and thermal gradients, which could impact visibility, comfort, and the persistence of low clouds.
