Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with a pronounced increase during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation and condensation, which is typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the middle of the day, peaking sharply before declining again, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were elevated during the overnight and morning hours, particularly from southerly to westerly directions, contributing to the cooling and fog development, while a shift to easterly and northerly winds later in the day may indicate changing synoptic influences. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic coastal weather cycle, with marine layer activity dominating the night and early morning, followed by a transition toward drier, more stable conditions as the day progresses.
