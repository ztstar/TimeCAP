Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s marine layer behavior. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decrease in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, possibly indicating the influence of a developing onshore flow. These patterns collectively suggest the onset of a transition period, with increasing wind and changing direction hinting at the potential for clearer skies and warmer conditions later in the day.
