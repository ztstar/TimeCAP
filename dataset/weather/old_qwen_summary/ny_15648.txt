Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early hours, indicating a moist air mass, which then dropped significantly as the day progressed, suggesting a change in air mass or drying out of the boundary layer. Air pressure showed a gradual increase toward the end of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction suggesting changing circulation patterns, including a possible shift from southerly to northerly flow. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cooler night into a drier, more stable afternoon, with improving weather conditions expected in the near term.
