Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. A prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, particularly between midnight and mid-morning, was accompanied by a sharp rise in air pressure that peaked during the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained consistently low until mid-afternoon, when they increased slightly, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly and westerly angles, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. The stability in wind direction earlier in the day points to a persistent, calm air mass, while the later shift may signal the beginning of a transition in weather patterns. Overall, the combination of high humidity, strong pressure buildup, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier and potentially more variable air mass later in the day.
