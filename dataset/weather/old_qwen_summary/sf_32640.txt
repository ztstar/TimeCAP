Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, which suggests the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which generally correlates with stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low during most of the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast, likely driven by thermal gradients and coastal breezes. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly patterns reflects changing synoptic influences, potentially contributing to the clearing skies and warmer temperatures observed in the latter half of the day.
