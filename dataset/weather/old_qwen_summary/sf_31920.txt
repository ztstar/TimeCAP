Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, then dropped sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as sunlight increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable increase in the late morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with consistent southerly to westerly flow, reinforcing the coastal influence and facilitating the movement of fog inland during the night. The shift in wind direction toward the evening suggests a change in local circulation patterns, potentially indicating the onset of a sea breeze or the influence of a broader synoptic-scale weather feature.
