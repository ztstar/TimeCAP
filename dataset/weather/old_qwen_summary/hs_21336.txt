Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a slight recovery, indicating a cooling trend that may be associated with an approaching weather system. Humidity levels remained consistently high, near or at saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and a significant potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable conditions but may also precede frontal activity. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable shift in direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, suggesting changing wind patterns consistent with a frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather, with the possibility of rain or thunderstorms developing in the near term as moist, unstable air interacts with the advancing system.
