Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased significantly during the morning hours, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds diminished overnight and stayed low through the morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, which may signal a change in air flow patterns. These combined trends point to improving weather conditions, with drier air and stable pressure supporting a likely transition to fair and calm conditions by late afternoon.
