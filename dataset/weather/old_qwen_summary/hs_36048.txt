Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation by late night and remaining high through the early morning before gradually declining through the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the night and early morning but showed a gradual decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased modestly during the day, particularly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to southeasterly, indicating a change in air mass and potential influence from a developing weather front. These conditions collectively suggest the possibility of unstable weather later in the day, including the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms as warm, moist air continues to build.
