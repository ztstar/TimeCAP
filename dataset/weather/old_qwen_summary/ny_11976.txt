Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure indicates the approach of a strong low-pressure system, likely bringing stormy conditions. Temperature gradually increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting a warming trend associated with the advancing front. Humidity reached near saturation levels, particularly during peak hours, increasing the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds intensified notably in the early morning, with gusts exceeding 10 m/s, driven by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, consistent with storm surge dynamics. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, strong winds, and a warming trend points to an active and potentially severe weather event impacting the city.
