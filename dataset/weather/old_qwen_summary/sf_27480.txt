Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night into early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable pressure fluctuation occurred, with a sharp drop followed by a rise, indicating the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest, suggesting the influence of coastal dynamics and potentially stronger onshore flow. These conditions point to a transition period, with lingering marine influence and the potential for foggy or overcast conditions later in the day.
