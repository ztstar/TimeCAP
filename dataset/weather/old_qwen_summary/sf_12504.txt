Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the overnight hours before beginning a gradual回升 in the morning. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations suggesting a persistent high-pressure system influencing the region, but with subtle shifts that may have enabled localized weather changes. Wind patterns showed consistent offshore flow during the night and early morning, followed by a shift to more variable and lighter winds in the afternoon, which may have limited air mixing and contributed to fog persistence. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and low wind speeds during the night hours points to favorable conditions for fog formation, a hallmark of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly in coastal areas.
