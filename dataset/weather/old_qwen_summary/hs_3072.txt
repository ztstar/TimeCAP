Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist and increased potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the early morning, culminating in a sharp rise mid-morning, followed by a decline later in the day—this fluctuation reflects the passage of a weather system, possibly a front or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening, particularly toward the final hours, with strong gusts from the southeast, implying a shift in wind patterns consistent with storm development or frontal movement. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind activity points to a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity in the near term, requiring public awareness of potential severe weather.
