Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure gradually rose through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, which may enhance mixing and influence precipitation chances. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south in the afternoon suggests a change in air mass, possibly indicating the arrival of a more humid, unstable air flow that could lead to unsettled weather later.
