Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn before sharply declining, suggesting a period of fog or dew formation followed by clearing skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then began a slight upward trend in the late morning, which is often associated with improving weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger gusts coming from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal system or a change in the local wind regime. The shift in wind direction from west-northwest to east-southeast late in the cycle may indicate a transition in air mass, possibly bringing milder and more humid conditions later in the day.
