Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region's humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, with near-saturation conditions contributing to a muggy atmosphere and increasing the potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady rise, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly directions in the afternoon, with increased gustiness in the late evening, possibly signaling the approach of a boundary or a change in air mass. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, unstable regime to a drier, more stable environment, with implications for reduced precipitation risk but continued discomfort due to high heat index values during peak daytime hours.
