Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回暖 during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold night to a milder day. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply dropping in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure consistently declined throughout the period, with the most rapid drop occurring in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained light to moderate, with brief increases during the morning and evening hours, and wind direction shifted from northerly to westerly and eventually southerly, consistent with the movement of a frontal system. These combined patterns indicate that a cold front passed through the city, bringing cooler temperatures, rising humidity, and a drop in pressure, likely resulting in overcast skies and a higher chance of precipitation earlier in the cycle, now clearing with improving conditions.
