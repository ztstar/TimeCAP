Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the middle of the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a brief period of calm, indicating a possible low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely pushing marine air inland and enhancing the cooling effect. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with pronounced fog, temperature fluctuations, and shifting wind directions driven by regional sea breeze and synoptic-scale influences.
