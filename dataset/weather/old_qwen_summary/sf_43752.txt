Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, suggesting the presence of a dense fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained stable and slightly elevated, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that has been anchoring over the region, suppressing storm development. Wind patterns showed variability, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west, which likely played a role in the mixing of marine air and the movement of fog inland. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and consistent wind from the ocean points to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, which has likely led to foggy conditions, especially during early morning hours.
