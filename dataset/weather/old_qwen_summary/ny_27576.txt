Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold night with a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before sunrise, which suggests the potential for fog or low visibility in the pre-dawn period. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a sharp rise in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest during the night to the southeast in the late afternoon, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cold, damp overnight period to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming day ahead.
