Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation and a high likelihood of precipitation earlier in the period. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining slightly in the late afternoon, signaling a transition from stable to slightly unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly, indicating a change in air mass movement that may have contributed to the moisture influx. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds implies a potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, especially as temperatures rise and atmospheric instability increases.
