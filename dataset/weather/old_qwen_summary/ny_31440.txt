Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of near-saturation conditions followed by a significant drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible precipitation impact. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, especially in the latter half of the period, which is often associated with approaching low-pressure systems and potential storm development. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and overnight, with strong gusts from variable but predominantly southerly to easterly directions, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined indicators point to the likelihood of unsettled weather, including possible rain or thunderstorms, particularly in the coming hours.
