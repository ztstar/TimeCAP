Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise from early morning lows to midday highs, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, with a notable drop in the afternoon, suggesting drier air may be moving in. Air pressure steadily increased through the early and mid-day hours, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late afternoon, with prevailing winds from the northwest and west sectors, potentially influencing the movement of air masses and dispersion of any pollutants. The combination of rising temperatures, stable pressure, and moderate winds points to improving weather conditions, likely resulting in a dry and mild day ahead.
