Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a steady rise, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a warming pattern consistent with diurnal cycles. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase in the early morning hours, peaking dramatically before a sudden drop toward the end of the period, indicating possible precipitation or a rapid clearing of moisture. Air pressure declined steadily through the day, reaching a low point near the end, which, combined with sustained high humidity and wind shifts, points to an approaching weather front or storm system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in direction from easterly to westerly, followed by a brief lull and then a resurgence, reflecting dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined signals suggest deteriorating weather conditions, with a high likelihood of precipitation and potential for strong winds in the near term.
