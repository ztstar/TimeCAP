Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels dropped sharply overnight, reaching their lowest point in the early morning, then began to rise slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend during the night and possible moisture influx later. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which typically signals the approach of stable, fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, shifting to light and variable in the afternoon, with wind direction transitioning from westerly to easterly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, increasing pressure, and diminishing winds points to a transition toward more stable and pleasant conditions in the coming hours.
