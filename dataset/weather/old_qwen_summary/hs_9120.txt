Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming, particularly in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, then declined sharply during the day, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a significant rise in the early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase in the midday hours, while shifts in wind direction—from predominantly northwest to southerly—point to changing air mass dynamics, possibly signaling a shift in weather patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable night into a warmer, drier day, with potential implications for increased heat accumulation and reduced chance of precipitation.
