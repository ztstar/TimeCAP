Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily into the afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating and a weakening overnight cooling effect. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours and maintaining near-saturated conditions, which enhances the perceived heat and supports the potential for isolated thunderstorms. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations but generally remained stable, with a minor increase mid-day, suggesting a stable atmospheric layer that may inhibit storm development unless destabilized by further heating. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, which likely contributed to the transport of moist air into the region, fueling high humidity. The combination of warm temperatures, high moisture, and persistent wind patterns indicates a high risk of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as solar heating intensifies in the coming hours.
