Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of early autumn. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn before sharply declining, suggesting the presence of a boundary layer inversion and potential fog formation in the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which is associated with stable, dry, and generally clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the early morning and late evening, with a notable increase in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and later from the east, likely driven by the developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and then to the east suggests changing airflow patterns, possibly indicating a transition in the local weather regime, though the overall trend points to improving and settled conditions.
