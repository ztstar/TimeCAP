Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the midday, suggesting the influence of a marine layer and subsequent clearing. Air pressure showed a marked rise in the early morning, reaching a peak before a sudden drop toward the end of the period, which may indicate the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with onshore flow often associated with coastal fog and cool air advection. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a stable, foggy marine layer to a drier, windier environment, potentially heralding a shift in the local weather pattern.
