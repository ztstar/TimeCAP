Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and the influence of a drying onshore breeze. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight decline toward the end of the period, hinting at possible approaching atmospheric changes or shifting weather patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more variable and northerly, which may signal the onset of a change in local circulation. Together, these patterns suggest a transition from a foggy, stable coastal environment to a drier, more dynamic regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies later in the day.
