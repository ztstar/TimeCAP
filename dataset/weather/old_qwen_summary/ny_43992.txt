Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature remained relatively stable throughout the night and early morning, with a slight increase during the late afternoon, suggesting a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a damp and oppressive feel, especially during the early morning hours. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a sharp spike in the evening hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south-southwest, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined indicators point to an active weather front moving through the region, likely bringing precipitation and possibly stronger storms in the near term.
