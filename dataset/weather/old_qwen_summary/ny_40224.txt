Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is typically associated with unsettled weather. Temperatures remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase through the day, suggesting warming trends as the system evolved. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking and remaining high, pointing to saturated air conditions that may lead to fog or precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, likely driven by the developing low-pressure system and increasing atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly suggests a change in airflow, which may bring additional moisture and potentially contribute to rain or storms later in the day.
