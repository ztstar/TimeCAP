Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained relatively stable through the night, then surged significantly in the late evening, suggesting increasing moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass patterns, possibly bringing in more maritime influences. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the atmosphere, with increasing instability and the potential for developing precipitation later in the day.
