Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity spiked during the early morning hours, suggesting possible dew point saturation, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with calm periods at night, but increased notably during midday, likely due to thermal convection and daytime heating. Wind direction shifted significantly, transitioning from southerly to northerly patterns, which could indicate a change in air mass and potential for clearer skies ahead.
