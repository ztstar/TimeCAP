Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a persistent high-pressure system influencing the region, which typically brings stable and cool conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases in the late afternoon, and wind direction showed variability but predominantly from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal influences. The combination of cool temperatures, high humidity, and weak winds suggests a strong likelihood of persistent fog, especially in low-lying and coastal areas, which may impact morning commutes and outdoor activities.
