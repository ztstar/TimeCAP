Temperature showed a gradual decline overnight, followed by a steady rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase during the early hours, suggesting possible moisture accumulation or a shift in air mass, followed by a pronounced drop later in the day. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and early afternoon, with gusts from the southwest, possibly linked to a developing low-pressure influence. Combined with shifting wind directions and variable humidity, these patterns suggest dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially signaling a transition toward more unsettled weather conditions.
