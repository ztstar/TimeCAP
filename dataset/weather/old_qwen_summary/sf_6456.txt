Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late morning, with stronger and more variable winds emerging, suggesting the influence of changing pressure systems. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase during the night, followed by a sudden drop in the early morning, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front. These conditions point to a dynamic transition in the local weather, with possible fog dissipation and an increasing likelihood of clearer skies as the day progresses.
