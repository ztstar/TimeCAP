Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching near-saturation in the early morning and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting possible convective activity or a passing frontal influence. Air pressure showed brief increases followed by a notable decline late in the period, indicating a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with gusts observed in the late evening, particularly from the east and southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period where moisture influx and temperature shifts may increase the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms, especially in the late evening and overnight hours.
