Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a significant daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the early morning hours before sharply increasing in the late night, suggesting the influence of nocturnal moisture accumulation, likely linked to a shift in air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a gradual rise, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system or front that may have contributed to the observed humidity changes. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with only brief fluctuations in direction—particularly a shift to southerly and easterly flow during the late night and early morning—indicating a weak or stalled weather system over the area. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and minimal wind suggests the potential for increasing discomfort during the day, with possible development of localized convection if moisture and instability continue to build.
