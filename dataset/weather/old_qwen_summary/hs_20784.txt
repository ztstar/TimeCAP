Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air that may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northwesterly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These combined trends point to a developing weather pattern that may lead to showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if moisture and instability continue to build.
