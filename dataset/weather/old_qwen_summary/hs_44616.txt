Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity reached saturation levels during the early hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which gradually decreased as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely driven by developing convection and a shifting pressure gradient. Combined with sustained high humidity and decreasing pressure, these conditions point to a heightened potential for thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term.
