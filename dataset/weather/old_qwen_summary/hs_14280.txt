Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming, particularly in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a marked drop in the early morning hours, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from weak and variable in the early morning to stronger and more consistent in the late afternoon, with a predominant southerly to easterly flow during the day, which likely contributed to the transport of moist air. These combined factors point to an evolving weather scenario that may support the development of isolated afternoon thunderstorms, especially as daytime heating intensifies.
