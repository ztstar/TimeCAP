Temperature has steadily declined throughout the past 24 hours, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours before rising significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in moisture content, possibly linked to changing air mass characteristics. Air pressure has shown a consistent and notable increase, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and late afternoon, with gusts reaching peak values, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the northwest, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined factors point to the arrival of a cold, dry, and stable air mass, likely resulting in crisp, clear weather conditions with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
