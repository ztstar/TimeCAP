Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from dry to moist conditions and back. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, driven by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and eventually southward. This pattern suggests the onset of a coastal breeze or synoptic-scale influence, potentially bringing increased mixing and reduced fog, which could affect visibility and comfort levels in the region.
