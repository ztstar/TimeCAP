Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the nighttime, peaking in the early hours, then steadily decreased as the day progressed, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher speeds and a consistent wind direction from the northwest, likely driven by the approaching high-pressure front. The combination of rising pressure, drying air, and strong northerly winds points to improving weather conditions, with clearer skies and cooler temperatures expected in the coming hours.
