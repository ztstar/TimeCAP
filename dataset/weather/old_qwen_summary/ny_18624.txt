Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist formation during the coldest part of the night. A notable decrease in air pressure, particularly in the early hours, was accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northeast, consistent with a developing frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind patterns points to an active weather system moving through the region, likely resulting in overcast conditions and possible rain in the coming hours.
