Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, signaling the presence of moist air masses, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, particularly during the overnight period. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and peaked in the late afternoon before declining slightly, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with southerly and easterly flows dominating in the morning and transitioning to more variable and stronger southeasterly to easterly winds during the afternoon, possibly enhancing moisture transport. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and consistent wind direction points to a developing stable boundary layer, which may suppress convective activity but could still lead to localized showers if instability builds later in the day.
