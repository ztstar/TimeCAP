Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly after midnight, reflecting a drying trend that likely resulted from the arrival of drier air, which may reduce fog formation and improve visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were initially moderate and shifted in direction from northwest to southwest, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting possible atmospheric instability or the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Collectively, these indicators point to a transitioning weather pattern, with the city likely experiencing improving conditions and a shift toward drier, more stable air in the near term.
