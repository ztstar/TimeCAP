Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought changing weather conditions. Temperature trends show a marked cooling during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the early morning, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a milder day. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then toward the northwest, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined patterns point to the arrival of unsettled weather, potentially including precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
