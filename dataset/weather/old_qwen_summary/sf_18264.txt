Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting dense fog formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and cooler perceived temperatures. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the early morning and strengthened slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from west-northwest to more variable patterns, possibly due to local topography and pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool night into a clearer, milder day, consistent with the region’s maritime climate.
