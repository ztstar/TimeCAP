Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold night followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity remained relatively stable during the early hours, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely due to warming and changing wind patterns. Air pressure dropped sharply in the mid-afternoon, followed by a rapid recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased during the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, which may have contributed to the temperature drop and pressure changes. The overall pattern suggests the influence of a transient weather front, with potential for variable conditions in the coming hours.
