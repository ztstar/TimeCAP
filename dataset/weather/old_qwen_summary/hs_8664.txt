Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation before dropping in the late morning, suggesting the presence of overnight condensation or a brief period of precipitation. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the final hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southerly direction in the early hours to a more variable, predominantly easterly and northeasterly flow by evening, likely influenced by changes in pressure gradients. These combined indicators point to a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, more settled day, with potential for improved visibility and reduced thunderstorm risk in the near term.
