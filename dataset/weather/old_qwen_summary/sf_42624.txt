Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility, particularly in the early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity, though a slight drop in the final hours suggests a possible change in weather patterns. Wind patterns showed a shift from predominantly southerly and westerly flows to more variable and stronger southerly winds by late evening, with a brief spike in speed, possibly signaling the approach of a coastal influence or a shift in sea breeze dynamics. These combined conditions point to a typical coastal fog event driven by nocturnal cooling and high moisture, which may persist into the early part of the next day.
