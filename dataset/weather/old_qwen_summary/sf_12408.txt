Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture in the air, likely due to coastal fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased wind speeds, signaling the potential approach of a weather system. Wind direction shifted from a consistent southerly flow to more variable and northerly directions, with gusts from the northwest in the final hours, indicative of changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds implies a possible transition to more unstable conditions, potentially bringing fog, light precipitation, or stronger winds later tonight.
