Over the past 24 hours, a steady rise in temperature was observed during the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a gradual decline in the evening, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects increasing solar heating. Humidity levels showed a notable increase during the early night, peaking in the middle of the night before dropping sharply in the late morning, suggesting possible moisture accumulation followed by clearing. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before beginning to fall slightly, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased during the night, particularly in the early hours, before increasing again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northwest to more southerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from cooler, stable conditions to a warmer, more variable atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for shifting weather patterns in the coming hours.
