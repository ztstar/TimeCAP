Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the day, indicating a transition from a cool, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds were minimal during the middle of the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest, possibly indicating the onset of a diurnal circulation pattern. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and later to the southeast suggests changing airflow patterns, potentially signaling the influence of a developing weather system that could impact conditions in the coming hours.
