Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a stable and unchanging atmospheric condition, with no fluctuations in temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent air pressure indicates a persistent high-pressure system, which typically brings calm and clear skies. The lack of variation in wind speed and direction suggests a steady flow of air from the southeast, characteristic of a stable marine layer influence. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, likely due to subsidence associated with the high-pressure system, reducing the potential for cloud formation or precipitation. This prolonged stability implies a continued risk of dry conditions, which could contribute to heightened fire danger in surrounding areas.
