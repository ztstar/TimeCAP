Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early and middle hours, contributing to a persistent damp feel, before declining significantly in the afternoon as air pressure began to fall. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to an approaching weather system. The drop in air pressure during the early evening hours indicates the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly including precipitation or stronger storms. Taken together, these patterns suggest that San Francisco may be transitioning into a more unstable weather regime, with increasing likelihood of clouds, wind, and possible rain later in the day.
