Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nocturnal temperature lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, decreasing significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting a drying trend associated with increasing solar insolation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which generally correlates with stable, clear weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to more southerly, indicating a change in local atmospheric flow. Overall, the data suggest improving conditions with drying air and stronger, more consistent winds, pointing to a likely clearing trend and reduced risk of thunderstorms in the near term.
