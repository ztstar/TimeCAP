Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting increased moisture availability that may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, indicating changing circulation patterns possibly linked to a developing weather front. The combination of rising humidity, increasing wind, and shifting pressure patterns suggests the potential for unstable conditions later tonight, including possible thunderstorms or showers.
