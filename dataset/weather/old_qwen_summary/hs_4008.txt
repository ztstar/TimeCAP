Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a passing front or changing air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility during the early hours, particularly near dawn. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp rise later in the evening, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, possibly accompanied by storm activity. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, consistent with a developing or passing boundary. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or showers in the near term.
