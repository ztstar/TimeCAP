Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing or drying trend. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure signal that may suggest the approach of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south-southeast sectors. These conditions—combined with the temperature rise and falling pressure—point to a developing atmospheric instability, raising the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
