Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. A significant shift in humidity occurred around mid-morning, with a sharp decline following a prolonged period of high moisture levels, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of a drying wind. Air pressure fluctuated noticeably, with a marked increase in the early hours likely linked to a high-pressure system influence, followed by a drop that coincided with the return of higher humidity and wind activity. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then back to westerly, indicating dynamic boundary layer changes. These combined factors suggest the approach of a weather transition, potentially bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
