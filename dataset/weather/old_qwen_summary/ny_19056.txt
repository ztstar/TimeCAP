Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning, indicating a cold overnight period. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop in the evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with consistent easterly to northerly flow, contributing to the cooling trend and possibly enhancing wind chill. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and persistent winds implies a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to precipitation or changing skies in the near term.
