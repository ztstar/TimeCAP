Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with multiple spikes to near saturation, suggesting periods of high moisture content that could contribute to discomfort and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-level moisture surge. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a more humid and potentially unstable environment, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
