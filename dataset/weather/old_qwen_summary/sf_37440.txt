Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting a shift from foggy, moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly during the late night and early morning, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds increased markedly in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, likely due to the influence of the high-pressure ridge and coastal dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a clearer, drier, and more stable environment, consistent with typical afternoon clearing in the Bay Area.
