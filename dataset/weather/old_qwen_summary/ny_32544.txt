Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of early autumn. Humidity levels rose during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily declining through the day, suggesting increasing stability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise early in the period, followed by a minor drop later, consistent with a weakening high-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then easterly, hinting at a changing synoptic pattern. These combined factors suggest the approach of a weather system that could bring variable conditions, including possible showers, in the coming hours.
