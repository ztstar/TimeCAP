Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating warming trends during the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining persistently high, which contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with sustained southerly to southwesterly flow, enhancing moisture transport into the region. These combined conditions point to a heightened potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
