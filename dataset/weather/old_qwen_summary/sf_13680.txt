Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures consistently declining through the night and early morning before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly during the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts arriving from the northwest and west, consistent with onshore flow and the influence of coastal dynamics. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and westerly sectors late in the period hints at changing synoptic patterns, potentially setting the stage for a shift in weather, including possible clearing or the arrival of more persistent fog.
