Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced exceptionally stable atmospheric conditions with no measurable variation in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent maritime influence, likely driven by a stable high-pressure system offshore. The uniformly low humidity levels indicate dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk, especially in nearby vegetation zones. With no changes in pressure or wind patterns, the weather is expected to remain calm and unchanging in the immediate forecast period. This prolonged stability, while favorable for outdoor activities, may also limit air dispersion, potentially affecting air quality in urban areas.
