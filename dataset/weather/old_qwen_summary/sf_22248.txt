Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with marine air inflow. These patterns suggest a typical coastal fog and temperature inversion cycle, with potential for foggy conditions overnight and improving visibility during the day.
