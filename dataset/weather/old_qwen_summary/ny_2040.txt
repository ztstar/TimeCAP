Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise from early morning lows, indicating a gradual warming trend through the day. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining elevated through midday before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely tied to a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased toward the evening, culminating in a significant rise by the end of the period, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds exhibited variability, with stronger gusts during midday and late evening, particularly from the southwest and west, possibly indicating a passage of a frontal boundary or localized storm activity. Combined, these conditions point to a transition from a cooler, moist, and unstable environment to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to clearer skies and more favorable conditions in the near term.
