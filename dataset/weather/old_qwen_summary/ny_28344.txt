Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with the approach and passage of a storm system. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, with potential for precipitation and unsettled conditions in the near term.
