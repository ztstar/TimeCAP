Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the gradual approach of a high-pressure system that may lead to clearer skies later. Wind speeds remained light for most of the period, but a slight increase occurred in the final hours, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These conditions point to a transition from a marine-influenced, foggy environment toward a drier, more stable atmosphere as the high-pressure system strengthens.
