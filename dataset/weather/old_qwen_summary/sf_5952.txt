Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels remained persistently high, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is characteristic of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of significant weather systems passing through, consistent with a period of stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the weakening of the marine layer. These conditions together suggest a transition from a foggy, cool overnight period to a clearer, warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
