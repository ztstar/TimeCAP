Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air as a midday high-pressure system began to influence the region. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is a strong indicator of improving weather conditions and the approach of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing significantly in the afternoon before picking up again in the evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and enhancing overall comfort in the city.
