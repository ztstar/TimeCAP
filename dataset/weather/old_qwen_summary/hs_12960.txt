Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting increased moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a declining trend throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point around dawn, which may signal an approaching weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger gusts from the southeast, consistent with a developing low-pressure influence. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and easterly sectors underscores an inflow of moist air, enhancing the likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day.
