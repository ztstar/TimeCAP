Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, peaking in the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, potentially signaling the onset of a breeze-driven pattern associated with coastal influences. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with implications for comfort levels and possible convective development later in the day.
