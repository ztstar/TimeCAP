Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct diurnal temperature cycle, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and rising steadily through the day, indicating a clear cooling trend followed by solar warming. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, then surged dramatically in the evening and early morning, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and possible fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the late evening and early morning hours, peaking before dropping again, which may signal the approach of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the east and southeast, with stronger gusts at night, likely due to the interaction between coastal flow and local topography. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, combined with rising humidity and pressure changes, points to an evolving coastal weather pattern that could bring foggy conditions and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
