Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by shifting air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content in the early morning hours, suggesting possible fog or dew formation, followed by a notable drop in humidity during midday, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with storm development and frontal passage. Combined, these patterns indicate that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially unstable weather, with increased chances of precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
