Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and increasing humidity. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining elevated through midday before gradually declining, which suggests a buildup of moisture followed by dispersion. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late afternoon before stabilizing, signaling the possible influence of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south during the evening, consistent with a developing onshore flow that may bring additional moisture. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward a more humid and potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of isolated afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
