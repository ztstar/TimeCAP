Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking above 90%, indicating the presence of fog or dense moisture, which is typical in coastal areas during nighttime inversions. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, stabilizing at a high level before gradually decreasing, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that may have suppressed storm activity. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained breezes from the west-southwest, consistent with a marine layer influence pushing moisture inland. The shift in wind direction from the south to the west-southwest and the overall stability in atmospheric conditions point to a persistent coastal pattern, likely contributing to cool, foggy mornings and mild, clear afternoons.
