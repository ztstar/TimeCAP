Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler marine influence to stronger daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during midday, suggesting the dissipation of low-level fog or coastal stratus, which is typical of a clearing pattern in the region. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from a southerly to a more westerly and then a northerly component, potentially signaling a change in synoptic flow. Air pressure fluctuated, with a pronounced drop in the late afternoon, which may be associated with the approach of a weather system or a shift in atmospheric stability. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone coastal regime to a more dynamic and variable weather regime, likely affecting visibility, comfort, and local wind conditions.
