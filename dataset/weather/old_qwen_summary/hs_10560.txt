Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping during midday, indicating a possible frontal passage or shift in air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, reaching a peak just before dawn, then declined sharply during the late morning and early afternoon—a pattern often associated with approaching storm systems. Wind speeds remained minimal throughout the period, except for a brief pause in the early morning, suggesting weak synoptic forcing. The sudden change in wind direction during the midday hours, from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, supports the idea of a developing low-pressure influence, which could lead to unstable conditions later in the day.
