Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend associated with overnight radiative loss and subsequent solar warming. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking near saturation in the early morning hours, which suggests the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility. A consistent drop in air pressure throughout the night and into the early morning indicates an approaching low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather, including precipitation, in the near term. Wind speeds remained generally light, with occasional gusts, and wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing synoptic influences as the low-pressure system evolved. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward potentially stormy weather, with increased chances of rain and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
