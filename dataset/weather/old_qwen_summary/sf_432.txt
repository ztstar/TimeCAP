Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture in the air—likely due to marine layer formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a consistent high-pressure influence that has helped maintain calm conditions. Wind speeds were low during the nighttime hours, especially around dawn, but increased steadily in the late morning and afternoon, with a shift in wind direction suggesting changing airflow patterns influenced by coastal dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and increasing winds points to a transition from foggy, calm conditions to a more variable and potentially breezy afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
