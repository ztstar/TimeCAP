Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight drop in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, with sustained easterly to northerly flow, then diminished later, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, potentially signaling a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising humidity, temperature recovery, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for fog dissipation and clearing skies in the coming hours, with moderate conditions likely to persist into the night.
