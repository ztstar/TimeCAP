Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a weak high-pressure influence, though a brief rise in the mid-afternoon may suggest a transient atmospheric adjustment. Wind patterns shifted notably, with stronger and more variable winds in the early morning and late evening, particularly from southern and eastern sectors, possibly influencing coastal air flow and temperature distribution. The combination of high nighttime humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind directions points to a likely marine layer presence, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather dynamics.
