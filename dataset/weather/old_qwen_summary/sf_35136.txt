Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, indicating a period of condensation and possible fog formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which suggests the passage of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southwesterly to northerly quadrant, likely associated with coastal dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a cooler, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior during the day.
