Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually decreasing through the night before stabilizing in the mid-morning. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, ranging from moderate to near-saturated, with a sustained increase in the late evening and early morning hours, indicating possible fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the first half of the period, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest sectors, consistent with coastal upwelling and marine layer dynamics. These combined factors point to an active marine influence, with potential for fog, cooler conditions, and shifting wind patterns affecting visibility and local weather conditions.
