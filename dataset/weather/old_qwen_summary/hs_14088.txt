Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating and atmospheric instability. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, suggesting nocturnal moisture accumulation, which then declined sharply during the midday, coinciding with rising temperatures and drying winds. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic spike in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop, signaling the passage of a strong weather system—possibly a cold front—through the region. Wind speeds increased substantially during this period, with sustained gusts from the southeast to southwest, aligning with the pressure changes and suggesting a shift in wind patterns consistent with frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, particularly if moisture continues to converge ahead of the front.
