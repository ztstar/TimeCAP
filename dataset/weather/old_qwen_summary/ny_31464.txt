Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon. A notable increase in relative humidity during early morning hours, peaking at saturation, suggests the likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during the night. Air pressure steadily decreased, especially in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach or passage of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from northerly to more easterly, consistent with a developing storm system influencing the region. These combined indicators point to a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with increased chances of precipitation and gusty conditions in the near term.
