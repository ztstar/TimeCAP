Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight followed by a steady warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight drop. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind patterns shifted notably during the night, with a change in direction from west to southeast, followed by variable and occasionally stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening. These combined factors suggest a transition from cooler, moist conditions to a drier, more stable environment, likely leading to clear skies and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
