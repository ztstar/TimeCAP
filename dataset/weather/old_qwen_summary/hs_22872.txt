Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, peaking in the early morning hours before gradually decreasing, which suggests a persistent moist air mass influence. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling a possible approaching weather system or low-pressure development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southeasterly to easterly directions, consistent with a developing maritime inflow. These conditions collectively point to a humid, warming trend with potential for increased instability and the likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day or overnight.
