Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before a gradual回升 in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or heavy dew, which likely contributed to a noticeable dampness in the air. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a sustained drop later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather system that brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a brief intensification in the early morning, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and then northeasterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition period likely associated with a frontal passage, which may have brought the potential for localized showers or thunderstorms as the system continues to evolve.
