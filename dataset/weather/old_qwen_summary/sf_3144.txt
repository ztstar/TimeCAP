Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, peaking in the early morning hours and then plummeting during midday, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier conditions. A pronounced increase in air pressure occurred around the middle of the night, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the evening and early morning, but weakened substantially during the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the northeast and later the southeast, indicating a change in air mass. These patterns suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to a drier, more stable atmosphere, consistent with the onset of a clearing trend and improving visibility.
