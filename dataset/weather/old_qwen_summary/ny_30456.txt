Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend during the night. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the potential for fog formation or mist, especially given the temperature inversion likely occurring near the surface. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase midday, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern possibly linked to a frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing winds points to a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, though residual moisture may persist into the early evening.
