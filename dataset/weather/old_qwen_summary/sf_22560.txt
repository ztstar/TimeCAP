Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as solar heating increased. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or shifting weather front. Wind speeds remained low and consistent through the night, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from a southwest to a northeasterly flow, indicating a change in air mass movement across the region. Collectively, these changes point to the influence of coastal upwelling and the daily cycle of marine layer development and dissipation, typical of San Francisco’s temperate climate.
