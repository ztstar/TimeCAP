Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating a saturated atmosphere that contributed to a muggy feel and increased likelihood of precipitation. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling during the night followed by a steady rise in the morning, suggesting the onset of a warming period typically associated with daytime heating. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reflecting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unstable conditions and thunderstorms. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which is indicative of strong atmospheric instability and possible storm development. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, falling pressure, and variable winds points to a high probability of scattered to isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
