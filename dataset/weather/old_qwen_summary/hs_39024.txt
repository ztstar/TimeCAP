Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning and dropping sharply in the afternoon before rebounding slightly in the late night, suggesting possible moisture influx and subsequent drying. Air pressure steadily declined, reaching its lowest point toward the end of the period, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system or storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, indicating changing airflow patterns typical of approaching frontal activity. These combined indicators suggest the potential for unstable weather conditions, including possible thunderstorms or heavy rainfall, particularly in the evening and overnight hours.
