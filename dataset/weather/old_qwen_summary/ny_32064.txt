Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with saturation occurring during early morning hours and a sharp drop in the late morning, suggesting a transition from damp conditions to drier air. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, culminating in a low point in the late evening, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with consistent southerly to westerly flows indicating dynamic air movement across the region. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind, and variable humidity implies a high likelihood of changing weather conditions, potentially including precipitation, in the near term.
