Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible moisture influx or frontal influence. Air pressure showed a consistent decline during the late night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system or approaching weather disturbance. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast to south sectors, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could enhance moisture transport. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather pattern with potential for increased cloud cover and isolated showers, particularly during the late evening hours.
