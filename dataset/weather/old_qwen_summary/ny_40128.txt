Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual warming from early morning through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of increasing solar radiation and potential advection of warmer air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn before beginning to fall, which may have contributed to foggy or overcast conditions. Wind speed increased notably in the evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from a northerly to easterly direction, potentially enhancing cooling and dispersing pollutants. The shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, combined with falling pressure and rising humidity, points to the arrival of a frontal boundary that could bring precipitation in the near term.
