Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise in temperature through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the late afternoon and evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a minor fluctuation in the late afternoon, suggesting a stable atmospheric regime with limited storm development. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These conditions suggest a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to drier, more dynamic air, potentially reducing the chance of precipitation but increasing wind discomfort and heat retention during the day.
