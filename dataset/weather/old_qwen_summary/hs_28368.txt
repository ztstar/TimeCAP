Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially during nighttime and early morning, indicating potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with notable gusts in the late evening, driven by shifting wind directions from the northwest to the southwest, potentially influencing storm development or dissipation. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind from the southwest, and lingering moisture suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, though localized showers cannot be ruled out.
