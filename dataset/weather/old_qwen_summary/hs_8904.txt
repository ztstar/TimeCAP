Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that may have contributed to condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early to mid-day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which likely brought stable and clearer conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, with a sudden change in direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly, accompanied by increased wind speeds—indicative of a frontal passage or local circulation change. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid period to a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for thunderstorm development if moisture and instability remain elevated.
