Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining into the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a significant spike during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a nocturnal boundary layer development or a passing frontal influence. Air pressure rose consistently through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before slowly declining, suggesting a high-pressure system moving in and then weakening. Wind patterns shifted from a northerly to a more easterly and southerly direction during the evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds, which may signal the onset of a change in air mass. The combination of elevated humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a potential weather transition, possibly indicating the approach of a moist, unstable air mass that could lead to afternoon thunderstorms.
