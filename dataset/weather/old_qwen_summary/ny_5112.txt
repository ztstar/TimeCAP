Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of nighttime condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northerly, consistent with a changing frontal pattern. These combined indicators suggest that a weather front is moving through the region, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
