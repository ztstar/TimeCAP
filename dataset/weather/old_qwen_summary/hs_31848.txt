Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to a damp, muggy feel and increased fog or condensation risk. Air pressure remained stable to slightly rising through the night, indicating a relatively steady high-pressure influence, though a brief drop in the early morning suggests possible marginal disturbance. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and eventually westerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a more variable, potentially unsettled period, which could precede localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
