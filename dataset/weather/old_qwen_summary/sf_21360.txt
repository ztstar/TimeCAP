Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation and persisting through the night, indicating a strong likelihood of fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies in the coming hours. Wind speeds remained generally low but showed bursts of stronger gusts, particularly during the early morning and late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction signaling dynamic air flow patterns across the region. These conditions collectively point to a coastal marine influence, with persistent fog and stable air masses typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, likely prolonging cool, damp conditions into the next day.
