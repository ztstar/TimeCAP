Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a low before beginning a gradual回升 in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late morning and remaining elevated, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or a change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained minimal until late evening, when they intensified, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to northeasterly, suggesting a change in regional airflow. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—point to a developing weather shift, potentially bringing overcast conditions or light precipitation in the near term.
