Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity spiked during the overnight hours, indicating increased moisture availability, which likely contributed to the cooler nighttime temperatures. A significant pressure increase occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the daytime, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass patterns, possibly linked to a passing front. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime environment, typical of a developing high-pressure influence in the region.
