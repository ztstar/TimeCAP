Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant shift from high humidity and cool temperatures during the early morning to a marked warming trend during the afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening warm front. A notable drop in humidity coincided with a rise in temperature and a sustained increase in air pressure, suggesting the arrival of drier, more stable air. Wind speeds remained moderate but consistent, with a steady southeasterly to easterly flow that gradually shifted toward the northeast, aligning with the movement of the high-pressure system. The stable pressure trend and decreasing humidity suggest improving conditions, with potential for clearer skies later in the day. Overall, the pattern reflects the transition from a damp, cooler period to a warmer, drier afternoon, typical of a post-frontal weather regime in the region.
