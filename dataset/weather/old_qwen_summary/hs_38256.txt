Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels spiked to saturation overnight, sustaining near-100% for several hours, which likely contributed to a persistent damp feel and increased likelihood of localized precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that would promote clearing skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to southwesterly and later to easterly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to an improving weather outlook with reduced chances of storms and increasing comfort levels later in the day.
