Temperature showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a steady rise during the morning hours. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture levels followed by sharp drops, indicating possible precipitation events and subsequent clearing. Air pressure steadily increased through the evening and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night but intensified during the mid-morning and late afternoon, with variable directions pointing to shifting airflow patterns. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a damp, unstable overnight period to a clearer, drier, and more stable day ahead, with potential for improving visibility and comfortable conditions.
