Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant warming trend likely driven by solar heating and subsiding air. Humidity levels showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend following earlier high moisture conditions, possibly due to a shift in air mass. Air pressure declined steadily through the evening and night, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly, which may signal the approach of a frontal boundary or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from variable directions to more consistent southerly and easterly flow, potentially transporting warmer, moist air into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and strengthening winds suggests the potential for unstable conditions, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
