Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before decreasing through the day, indicating a shift from stable to more dynamic atmospheric conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning and late afternoon, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by a significant shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition from cooler, more humid conditions toward warmer, drier air, with decreasing wind and increasing pressure indicating improving weather conditions.
