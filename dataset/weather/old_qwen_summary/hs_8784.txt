Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the onset of a daytime heating phase. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the midday hours before stabilizing in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A notable decrease in atmospheric pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a slow recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that shifted slightly toward the west by the end of the cycle, potentially indicating a change in wind pattern. These trends collectively suggest a developing afternoon heating regime and possible approaching atmospheric instability, which could increase the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
