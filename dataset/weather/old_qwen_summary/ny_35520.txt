Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, which typically brings unsettled weather. Temperature remained relatively stable during the early and middle hours before a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting a warming trend following a period of cooler conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking near saturation, which enhances the likelihood of precipitation and creates a damp, muggy feel. Wind patterns shifted from a southeasterly to a more southerly and then westerly direction, with speeds decreasing in the afternoon, consistent with the weakening of a frontal system. These combined indicators suggest that the city is transitioning through a period of unstable weather, with a high probability of rain or thunderstorms, particularly during the early evening hours.
