Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to the city. Temperature trends show a prolonged cold period followed by a gradual warming, suggesting a shift in air mass, possibly due to an advancing front. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout, contributing to a damp and chilly feel, especially during the early morning and late evening hours. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, signaling the intensification of the storm system. The change in wind direction from southeast to west-southwest aligns with the development of a frontal passage, which may bring precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
