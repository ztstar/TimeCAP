Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar insolation. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which is consistent with the formation of dense fog—a common occurrence in the region due to marine layer development. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, then stabilized, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that contributed to the increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind patterns shifted significantly during the evening, with a dramatic change in direction from westerly to southeasterly, likely driven by the interaction between the marine layer and local topography. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal fog event, with implications for visibility, transportation, and localized temperature moderation across the city.
