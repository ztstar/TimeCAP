Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the overnight period, suggesting the presence of stable atmospheric conditions that likely supported fog or mist formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak frontal boundary or localized storm system. Wind speeds increased notably in the mid-to-late afternoon, with stronger gusts from variable directions, potentially contributing to the dispersal of moisture and a gradual decrease in humidity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly sectors later in the day hints at changing air mass influences, possibly setting the stage for more dynamic weather conditions in the coming hours.
