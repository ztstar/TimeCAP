Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind speeds later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to westerly and then to more easterly directions, with a brief surge in wind speed in the late night and early morning, possibly signaling a change in local airflow dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to a drier, more stable atmosphere, typical of afternoon conditions in the region during the summer months.
