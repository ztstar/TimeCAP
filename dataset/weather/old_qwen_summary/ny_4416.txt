Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours, increasing slightly in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, peaking in the evening, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds exhibited significant variability, with notable gusts in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to localized atmospheric instabilities or frontal interactions. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, dry night to a gradually warming, windier day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
