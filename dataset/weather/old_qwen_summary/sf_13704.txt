Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a steady warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning hours, suggesting fog or low cloud formation, which subsequently decreased as temperatures rose, reflecting the dissipation of marine layer conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry, and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating dynamic airflow patterns, possibly influenced by the interaction between onshore breezes and regional topography. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy marine layer to a warmer, drier, and more stable afternoon regime, consistent with typical summer weather patterns in the region.
