Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage overnight. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early hours and dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting the influence of changing air masses. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before sharply declining in the late morning, a pattern consistent with the arrival and subsequent weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours, decreasing to near calm conditions in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from northwest to more southerly, reflecting a change in the prevailing atmospheric flow. These trends collectively suggest a transition from colder, drier conditions to a milder, more humid regime, potentially setting the stage for variable weather, including possible precipitation later in the day.
