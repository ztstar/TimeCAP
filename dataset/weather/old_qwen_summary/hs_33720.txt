Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then sharply declined through the midday, suggesting a drying trend associated with increasing temperatures and changing wind patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before decreasing slightly in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds were consistently low through the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then back to southerly, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest the passing of a moist, stable air mass and the potential for clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
