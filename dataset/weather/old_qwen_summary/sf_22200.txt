Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend overnight, followed by a steady increase in temperature during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a warmer daytime period. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, then sharply declined through the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds typical of the region's microclimate. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong throughout, with consistent easterly to northerly flow in the early hours and a notable shift toward more variable and southerly directions later, possibly reflecting changing circulation patterns. These trends collectively suggest a dynamic weather transition, with potential for increasing cloud cover and a higher chance of fog or drizzle in the coming hours as the low-pressure influence strengthens.
