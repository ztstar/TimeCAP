Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and a marked increase in wind speed, suggesting the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. The wind shift from southerly to northeasterly directions and the rise in wind speed in the late afternoon may have brought in drier air, contributing to the observed clearing trend. These dynamics point to a transition from a stable, moist marine layer toward a more variable and potentially stormy atmospheric regime.
