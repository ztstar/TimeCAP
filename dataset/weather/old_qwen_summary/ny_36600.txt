Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖, indicating the arrival of warmer air. Humidity levels exhibited a sharp rise during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point before stabilizing, signaling an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined trends point to an active weather pattern likely bringing overcast conditions, possible rain, and a shift in wind direction, potentially affecting travel and outdoor activities in the city.
