Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours before gradually rising again, indicating a nocturnal cooling followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels increased significantly in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with storm development and inflow of moist air. These combined trends point to an increasing likelihood of precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
