Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping only slightly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, indicating a persistent moisture presence in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief drop in the early hours and a slight rise in the afternoon, suggesting a weak high-pressure influence with some instability. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, potentially signaling the approach of a moist air mass. These conditions collectively point to a transition period with increasing humidity and wind activity, which may contribute to the development of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
