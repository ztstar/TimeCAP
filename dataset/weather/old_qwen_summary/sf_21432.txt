Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before steadily declining, indicating a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight downward trend toward the end of the period may hint at developing instability. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a marked shift in wind direction from westerly to northeasterly, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone marine layer to a more variable, potentially clearer regime later in the day.
