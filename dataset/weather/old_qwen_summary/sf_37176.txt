Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, then plummeting dramatically in the mid-morning, indicating a significant change in air mass or clearing conditions. A marked drop in air pressure occurred around the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with a coastal influence or frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly directions supports the arrival of a marine layer and potential fog development, particularly in the early morning hours.
