Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of moist air that likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the overnight period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward southerly to southeasterly flow, potentially transporting warm, moist air into the region. These combined factors—rising humidity, increasing pressure, and shifting wind patterns—suggest a transition toward a more stable and humid atmosphere, with possible implications for heat index and overnight cooling.
