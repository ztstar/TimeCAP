Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures decreasing steadily during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the predawn period before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure gradually increased through the night, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief intensification in the early morning and a more sustained increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, hinting at changing upper-level flow patterns. Overall, the data points to a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a progressively drier and more stable daytime environment, consistent with the approach of a high-pressure ridge.
