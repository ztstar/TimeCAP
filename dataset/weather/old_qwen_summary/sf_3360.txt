Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing during the night and early morning before beginning a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor increase during midday, indicating a consistent high-pressure influence that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly in the afternoon, which may have facilitated the influx of warmer air. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, foggy night to a clearer, slightly warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
