Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before plummeting sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of fog formation and subsequent dissipation. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, culminating in a low-pressure trough by late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or changing wind patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and overnight, with gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with onshore flow that often brings fog and cooler temperatures to the Bay Area. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and east in the final hours suggests a potential change in airflow, possibly marking the end of foggy conditions and the onset of clearer, drier air.
