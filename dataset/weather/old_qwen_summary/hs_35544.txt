Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the night before dropping dramatically as temperatures climbed, indicating a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal boundary layer to drier, more unstable daytime conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase overnight, stabilizing in the mid-1030s before declining slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from light and northerly in the night to more southerly and moderately stronger in the afternoon, potentially bringing in warmer, moisture-laden air. These changes point to an evolving synoptic setup, possibly signaling the approach of a developing weather system with implications for afternoon thunderstorm development.
