Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures climbed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a weakening of offshore winds, which may signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and gradually diminished, with a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore later in the day, potentially facilitating marine layer movement. These trends point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, warmer, and more stable weather, with possible implications for visibility and outdoor activities.
