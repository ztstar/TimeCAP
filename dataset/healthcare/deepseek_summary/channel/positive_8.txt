- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting increasing respiratory specimen testing and rising influenza positivity, peaking around the midpoint of the period before a sharp decline. The subsequent downward trajectory suggests a post-peak回落, potentially indicating the waning phase of an influenza season, with levels returning toward earlier baseline ranges. This pattern underscores the importance of timely surveillance and preparedness, as the rapid rise and fall may strain healthcare resources during peak periods and necessitate early intervention strategies.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a clear and sustained upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapidly accelerating influenza A activity, peaking sharply before beginning a marked decline. The subsequent decrease over the final five weeks suggests a waning phase of the seasonal outbreak, consistent with typical epidemic patterns following a peak. The magnitude and speed of both the rise and fall indicate a robust and intense influenza season, warranting continued surveillance and preparedness for potential resurgence or secondary waves.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a clear upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza B positivity, culminating in a peak during the latter part of this period. Following the peak, a sustained and pronounced decline is observed, indicating a significant reduction in active transmission or testing volume. This pattern suggests a typical seasonal influenza B surge followed by a waning phase, with potential implications for public health preparedness and resource allocation during the transition period.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the initial 15 weeks, reaching a peak before beginning a sharp decline in the final five weeks. The rapid ascent followed by a steep drop suggests a well-defined epidemic peak, likely reflecting a seasonal influenza surge that has now begun to subside. This pattern indicates a transient but intense period of circulation, with the current rate signaling a transition toward lower transmission levels, potentially warranting reduced public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid increase in influenza A positivity, peaking sharply before entering a pronounced decline. The subsequent six weeks demonstrate a steep and consistent drop, suggesting a waning phase of the influenza season with a notable rebound in the first week of decline followed by a steady reduction. This pattern indicates a classic epidemic curve, with the current phase likely signaling the end of the peak transmission period, which may inform public health planning for resource allocation and intervention timing.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapidly intensifying influenza B activity. A sharp peak was observed in the most recent week, indicating a significant surge in positivity rates that may signal the onset of a major seasonal wave. The pattern reflects a typical epidemic progression, with prolonged high levels following the peak, which could strain healthcare resources and emphasize the need for timely public health interventions.
