Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained low during the day but sharply increased overnight, indicating the arrival of moist air, likely associated with a marine layer. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the period, with a slight rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast and then back to the northwest, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These conditions point to a transition from dry, stable daytime weather to a more humid, potentially foggy nighttime environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
