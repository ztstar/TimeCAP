Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to New York City. Temperature remained consistently cold, with minimal fluctuation, suggesting a stable cold air mass in place. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late evening and overnight hours, peaking dramatically, which may signal the onset of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted significantly, particularly in the early morning, with a transition from southerly to easterly and then northerly flows, potentially indicating a frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and changing wind direction points to a high likelihood of rain or snow in the near term, with possible impacts on travel and outdoor activities.
