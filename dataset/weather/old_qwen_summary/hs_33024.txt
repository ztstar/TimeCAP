Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the night, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to a noticeable increase in fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual rise through the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system, which stabilized conditions before a slight drop in the late evening. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and easterly flows in the early hours to more southerly and westerly directions later, suggesting changing airflow associated with a passing frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and variable wind directions points to a transition from a moist, unstable night to a drier, more stable daytime pattern, potentially leading to clearer skies in the coming hours.
