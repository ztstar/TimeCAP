Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. A significant increase in humidity, peaking at saturation levels during the night, coincided with the lowest temperatures, indicating potential fog formation or dense low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and morning but began to decline slightly in the afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were light throughout most of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly in the late evening, which may indicate an onshore flow event. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable marine layer toward a drier, slightly warmer, and more variable wind pattern as the day progressed.
