Temperature trends indicate a steady overnight cooling followed by a gradual warming throughout the day, suggesting the onset of a diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity levels remained low during midday, then surged significantly in the evening, indicating a shift in air mass that may precede precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight drop, signaling a high-pressure system weakening and potential for changing conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, particularly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to west and then southwesterly, hinting at a developing frontal influence. Combined, these patterns suggest the arrival of a more unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of showers or storms later in the evening.
