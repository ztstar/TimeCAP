Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a minimum before rising slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a nighttime cooling trend followed by early warming. Wind speeds increased steadily through the morning and peaked in the afternoon, accompanied by a significant shift in wind direction from westerly to northeasterly, signaling a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. The air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, pointing to stable atmospheric conditions, though the wind shift suggests a developing dynamic adjustment. These combined conditions are typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, where coastal fog, variable winds, and temperature inversions frequently create layered weather patterns that influence daily conditions.
