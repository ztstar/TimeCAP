Temperature showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually increasing through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with peak levels in the early morning and late evening, suggesting increased moisture availability during cooler periods. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, likely due to evolving pressure gradients. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable air, which may suppress convective activity and reduce the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
