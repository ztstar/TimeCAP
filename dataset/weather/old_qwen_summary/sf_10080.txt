Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually rising toward midday. Humidity levels increased steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure declined consistently throughout the period, indicating a developing low-pressure system approaching from the northwest, potentially bringing unsettled conditions. Wind conditions remained light and consistently from the northwest, aligning with the prevailing marine layer pattern that often stabilizes the coastal atmosphere. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and falling pressure points to a high likelihood of fog or overcast skies, especially during the early morning and overnight hours.
