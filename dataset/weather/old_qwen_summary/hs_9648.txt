Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, culminating in a drop toward the end of the period, which may signal an approaching weather system, potentially bringing precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, and wind direction shifted from easterly to northerly, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow. Together, these indicators suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, potentially unstable daytime regime, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are present.
