Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City declined steadily through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation. Air pressure exhibited a sustained rise, particularly during the mid-to-late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and easterly sectors during the day, indicating changing air mass dynamics. Combined, these trends point to a transitioning weather pattern, likely clearing skies and improving conditions by late afternoon, with a dry and relatively calm environment expected in the coming hours.
