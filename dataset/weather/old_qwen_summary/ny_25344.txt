Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, indicating a period of near-saturated air, likely contributing to fog or mist conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, aligning with a shift in wind direction that could signal a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward potentially unstable or stormy conditions, particularly as warmer, moist air moves in behind the weakening front.
