Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, then dropped during the midday, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, which may have brought in cooler air and influenced localized conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more northerly sectors reflects changing atmospheric dynamics, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front, though current conditions remain relatively calm and stable.
