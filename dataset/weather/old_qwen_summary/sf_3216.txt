Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, reflecting typical diurnal patterns. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and dry conditions, especially in the late afternoon. Wind speeds were minimal during the morning and early evening, but a notable increase occurred in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, potentially signaling the onset of a change in weather patterns. These dynamics point to a transition from a foggy, stable night to a clearer, breezier day, consistent with coastal weather behavior in the region.
