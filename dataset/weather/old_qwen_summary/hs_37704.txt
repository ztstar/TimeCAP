Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting high moisture content in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A gradual decline in air pressure throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signals the approach of a low-pressure system, increasing the potential for unstable weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to an evolving atmospheric environment conducive to the development of thunderstorms, especially during the overnight hours.
