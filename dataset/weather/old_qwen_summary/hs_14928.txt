Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to more moderate daytime temperatures. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before steadily declining, suggesting possible moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure exhibited a significant increase overnight, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which typically signals the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, associated with clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, particularly in the late night and early morning, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly wind direction, contributing to the transport of moist air into the region. The combined patterns of rising humidity, stable high pressure, and sustained winds point to a period of increasing atmospheric stability, which may suppress thunderstorm development but could still lead to humid, muggy conditions during the day.
