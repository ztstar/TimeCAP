Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the early morning hours before stabilizing and beginning to rise slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, dropping sharply during midday and then surging through the night, indicating a transition from dry inland air to moist marine influence. A sustained drop in air pressure throughout the night suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, likely contributing to the increasing humidity and cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and east, hinting at the influence of a developing coastal wind pattern or frontal passage. These combined factors point to a shift toward more unsettled maritime conditions, potentially bringing overcast skies and a higher chance of fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
