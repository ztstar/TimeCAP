Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and increased likelihood of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the early morning, stabilizing at a higher level, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has brought relatively stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night, increasing in the early morning hours before tapering off, with wind direction shifting from northeast to more easterly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearing skies later in the day, though lingering moisture could support isolated afternoon showers.
