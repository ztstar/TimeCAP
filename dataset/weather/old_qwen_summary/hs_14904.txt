Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of a passing frontal system. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation likely associated with low-level convergence or a stalled front. Air pressure exhibited a distinct fluctuation, with a sharp rise midday, followed by a decline, which is typical of shifting synoptic-scale patterns, possibly linked to a developing low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing pressure gradients and the approach of a cold front. These combined indicators point to dynamic weather conditions, increasing the likelihood of scattered thunderstorms later in the day, particularly with the return of moist air and atmospheric instability.
