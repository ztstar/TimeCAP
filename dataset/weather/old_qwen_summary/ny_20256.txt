Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in air pressure, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature gradually increased through the day, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which enhances the perception of mugginess and supports the likelihood of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with a transition from southerly to northerly and then easterly flows, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined trends point to an ongoing weather event likely bringing rain or showers, especially during the overnight and early morning periods.
