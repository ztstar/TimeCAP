Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to a noticeable increase in discomfort and the potential for localized fog or mist. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has since stabilized. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly calm to more variable, with a notable change in direction from northerly to easterly and later southerly, suggesting a dynamic adjustment in local circulation. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds, and a warming trend suggests a transition toward more stable and settled conditions, potentially leading to clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
