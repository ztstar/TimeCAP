Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and a noticeable drop in perceived temperature. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the night, stabilizing around midday before a small decline, suggesting a transition from a stable high-pressure system to a weakening one. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong burst in the final hours, likely driven by developing local convection or a passing atmospheric disturbance. Wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly and then to variable patterns, indicating a complex flow pattern possibly associated with a weakening frontal boundary or an evolving mesoscale system.
