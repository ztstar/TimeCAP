Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning hours, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity remained relatively low during the early hours but spiked significantly in the early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability, possibly linked to fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase during the night and a return to calm in the late morning, while wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, followed by improving, drier, and more stable weather conditions expected in the coming hours.
