Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation in low-lying areas. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cooler, moist nighttime regime toward a drier, more stable daytime environment, likely resulting in improving visibility and clearing skies in the coming hours.
