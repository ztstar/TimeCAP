Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from nighttime radiative cooling to daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. A steady increase in atmospheric pressure during the late night and early morning signals the approach of a high-pressure system, consistent with stable, dry conditions expected in the coming hours. Wind speeds remained consistently low, but wind direction shifted significantly from northerly to easterly and southeasterly directions, reflecting a change in circulation patterns possibly associated with a coastal trough or sea breeze influence. These conditions point to a typical coastal fog pattern ending with clearing skies and improving visibility, setting the stage for a mild, sunny afternoon.
