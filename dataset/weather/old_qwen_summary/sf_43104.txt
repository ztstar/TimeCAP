Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through, though slight shifts were observed in conjunction with wind changes. Wind patterns were highly variable, with periods of calm followed by gusty conditions, particularly during the late night and early morning, and again in the late afternoon, likely driven by coastal breeze dynamics. The combination of low temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind directions points to the likelihood of fog formation and persistent coastal influence, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic weather patterns.
