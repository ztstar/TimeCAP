Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A significant increase in wind speed occurred in the late night and early morning, associated with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, suggesting a change in air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and early afternoon, peaking in the midday hours before declining slightly, which may indicate the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. The return of stronger winds and a shift in direction toward the northeast in the late evening suggests possible onshore flow, potentially bringing in cooler, moist air and increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle later in the night.
