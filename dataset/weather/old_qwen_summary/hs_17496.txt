Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 98% before declining in the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low cloud formation early in the day. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout most of the period, with a slight increase in the mid-afternoon and a minor drop toward the end, hinting at a stable high-pressure system with minimal dynamic changes. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly, indicating a possible change in air mass flow. These conditions together suggest a calm, humid, and gradually warming environment, with potential for localized showers or thunderstorms if instability develops later in the day.
