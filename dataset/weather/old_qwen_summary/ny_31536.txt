Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, then sharply declined in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum around dawn, which is typical of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, consistent with storm development and frontal passage. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind, and shifting wind direction points to active weather dynamics, likely bringing precipitation and unstable conditions in the coming hours.
