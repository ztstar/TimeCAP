Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation and remaining high through the early morning hours, indicating a significant increase in moisture, likely due to fog formation. Air pressure gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm, and wind direction shifted dramatically overnight, reflecting changes in local airflow patterns, possibly driven by coastal dynamics. These conditions suggest a coastal fog event that has since begun to dissipate, with warming and drying trends signaling the start of a clearer, more stable day ahead.
