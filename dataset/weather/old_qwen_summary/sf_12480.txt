Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests clearing skies and improved air circulation. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and peaked in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, signaling potential changes in local weather patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from damp, cool conditions to a more stable, drier, and slightly warmer environment by late evening.
