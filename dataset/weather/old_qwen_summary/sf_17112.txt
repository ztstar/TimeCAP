Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels reached and remained near saturation for an extended period, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which is characteristic of the city’s marine layer. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, calm conditions and the suppression of storm development. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a slight uptick in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, hinting at a potential change in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a typical coastal foggy and cool period, with limited atmospheric instability and no immediate threat of precipitation or strong winds.
