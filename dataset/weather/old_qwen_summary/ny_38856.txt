Over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend overnight followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels remained low throughout the period, particularly during the early morning and midday, suggesting dry air conditions that could contribute to increased fire risk and discomfort. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the late morning and stabilizing, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and night, with strong gusts observed, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions. The combined pattern suggests a transition from a stable, dry air mass to a more active environment, potentially bringing clearer skies but also heightened wind hazards in the coming hours.
