Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly as temperatures increased, indicating a possible fog or low cloud event during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and morning but showed a dip in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the mid-morning and again in the evening, with a consistent wind direction from the west to northwest during the early hours, suggesting marine influences. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and variable winds points to a transition period likely influenced by coastal air masses, with conditions conducive to fog or drizzle, especially near the waterfront.
