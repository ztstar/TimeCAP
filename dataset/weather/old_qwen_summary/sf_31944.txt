Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, beginning high and dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a mix of dry and moist air masses. Air pressure rose steadily through the early morning, peaked in the midday, and then dropped sharply in the late evening, indicating the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate during most of the day but increased dramatically in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northerly, which may signal the arrival of a new air mass. These changes collectively suggest the influence of a coastal frontal system, with potential for fog dissipation followed by breezy, variable conditions in the coming hours.
