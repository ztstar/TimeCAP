Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a dynamic diurnal cycle likely influenced by changing cloud cover and wind patterns. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the early morning and late night, suggesting the potential for fog or drizzle, while a sharp drop in moisture during midday points to clearing skies and increasing solar heating. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the early morning, peaking midday before declining, which may signal the passage of a weak front or atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with a shift to more southerly to southeasterly flow, potentially bringing moisture and instability. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward a more unstable and potentially storm-prone environment later in the day.
