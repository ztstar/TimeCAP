Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern typical of the region's humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours but increased substantially overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, suggesting a transition from stable to more unstable air conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late night hours, followed by a sharp rebound, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a developing frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late evening and overnight, with sustained stronger winds from the west and southwest, potentially indicating the influence of a boundary layer adjustment or approaching storm system. The combination of rising temperatures, shifting wind patterns, and variable pressure suggests a dynamic atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of convective activity later in the day.
