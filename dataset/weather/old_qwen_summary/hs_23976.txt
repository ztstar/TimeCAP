Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the cooler feel during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front. These combined patterns suggest a transition period, possibly leading to increased chances of precipitation or thunderstorms later in the day.
