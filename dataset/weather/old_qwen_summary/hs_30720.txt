Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, reducing visibility and increasing the perceived dampness. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise, suggesting the passage of a weather system that may have brought transient instability. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and evening, with a sustained southerly to southeasterly flow, which could indicate the onset of a frontal boundary or a change in synoptic-scale conditions. The combination of elevated humidity, shifting wind patterns, and pressure changes implies a potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
