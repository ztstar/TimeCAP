Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend throughout the night and early morning, likely due to increased cloud cover and high humidity. Humidity levels rose sharply in the latter half of the period, reaching saturation and remaining at 100% for several hours, which significantly enhances the perception of mugginess and increases the risk of fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend during the early morning hours, suggesting possible low-pressure influence and potential for unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night, peaking in the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in airflow that may signal an approaching weather system. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of precipitation or thunderstorm development in the near term, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours.
