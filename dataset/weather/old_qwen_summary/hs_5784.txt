Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady increase into the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise through the night and into the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system maintaining fair conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stable night to a warmer, more dynamic afternoon, increasing the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
