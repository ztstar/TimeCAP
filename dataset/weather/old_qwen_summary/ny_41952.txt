Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a high-pressure system that has likely contributed to clear skies and calm weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly and then easterly, which may signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Overall, the data point to a stable, dry, and mild day with little potential for precipitation, though the shift in wind direction warrants monitoring for possible changes in the coming hours.
