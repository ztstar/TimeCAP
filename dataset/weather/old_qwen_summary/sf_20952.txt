Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, with values reaching and maintaining saturation levels for much of the night and early morning, indicating a strong likelihood of fog formation. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling throughout the night, with the lowest readings occurring in the early morning hours, followed by a slow recovery during the day, suggesting a stable marine layer influence. Air pressure remained relatively steady with minor fluctuations, showing no significant pressure changes that would indicate an approaching storm system. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast and then toward the east-southeast, potentially signaling a change in the local wind pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer with fog and cool temperatures, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and suggest continued overcast skies and limited warming through the day.
