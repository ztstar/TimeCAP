Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel, followed by a rapid decline as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from west-northwesterly to southeasterly during the morning hours, suggesting a change in air mass. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
