Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening before leveling off, indicating the approach of a warmer daytime peak. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during midday, followed by a slight rebound in the late evening, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increased solar heating and reduced moisture advection. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the morning and afternoon, decreasing in the evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more easterly and northerly, consistent with changing flow patterns around the high-pressure system. These combined trends suggest improving weather conditions with reduced cloud cover and a lower likelihood of precipitation, favoring comfortable daytime temperatures and clearer skies.
