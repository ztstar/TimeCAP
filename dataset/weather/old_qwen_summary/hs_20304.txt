Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cool overnight period. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a gradual upward trend through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a higher level by midday, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds decreased overnight, reaching a minimum in the early hours, followed by a modest increase in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing winds, and increasing humidity points to a transition toward more stable and potentially muggy conditions, with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
