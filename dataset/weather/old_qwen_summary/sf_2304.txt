Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of marine layer development and potential fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, followed by a slight decline in the afternoon, hinting at a possible shift in atmospheric stability. Wind patterns were minimal during the early night but intensified in the late afternoon, with a notable shift toward southerly and easterly directions, potentially signaling the breakdown of the marine layer. These combined factors suggest that conditions were conducive to fog and low cloud cover overnight, with a transition toward clearer skies and slightly warmer temperatures during the day.
