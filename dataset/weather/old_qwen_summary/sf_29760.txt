Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect and reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited significant fluctuations, with a notable drop during the early night, followed by a sharp rise in the morning, pointing to the passage of a weather front that may have brought temporary instability. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and mid-afternoon, with strong, persistent winds from the southwest and west, consistent with coastal upwelling and sea breeze dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cool, moist maritime environment to a drier, warmer regime later in the day, with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility.
