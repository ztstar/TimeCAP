Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels declined consistently throughout the day, indicating drier air conditions, which may have contributed to a more comfortable feel despite rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a gradual downward trend, peaking slightly in the early hours before stabilizing at a lower level, suggesting possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing system. These combined factors suggest a transition in weather patterns, potentially signaling the onset of a more dynamic or unsettled period in the region.
