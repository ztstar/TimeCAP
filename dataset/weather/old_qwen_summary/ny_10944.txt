Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning hours indicated the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with unsettled weather. Humidity remained consistently high during the night and early morning, contributing to a damp and chilly feel, with a brief reduction in moisture levels mid-morning. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind directions shifting notably, suggesting changing atmospheric circulation. The combination of falling pressure, sustained high humidity, and fluctuating wind patterns points to a transient storm system passing through, which may have brought precipitation and could influence conditions in the coming hours.
