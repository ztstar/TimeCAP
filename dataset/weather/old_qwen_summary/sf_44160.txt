Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and early morning before beginning to rebound in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a notable rise in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief intensification in the early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted significantly, particularly from the south and southeast during the night, then turning toward the west and northwest in the afternoon—consistent with coastal breezes. These patterns suggest a developing marine layer with onshore flow during the night and a daytime breakdown of the fog layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, likely leading to a transition toward clearer, warmer conditions by morning.
