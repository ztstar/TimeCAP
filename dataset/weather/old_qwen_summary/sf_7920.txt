Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, peaking near saturation before rapidly declining as temperatures increased, indicating possible fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to more southerly and then westward, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of warming temperatures, falling humidity, and steady high pressure suggests improving conditions with reduced fog and increased daytime warmth.
