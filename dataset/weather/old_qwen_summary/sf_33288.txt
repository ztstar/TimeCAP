Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady temperature until late evening, followed by a notable drop, indicating a cooling trend likely tied to changing air masses. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the day before increasing significantly in the late evening, suggesting moist air infiltration. Air pressure showed a gradual rise, culminating in a sustained increase, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased during the late afternoon and early evening, then picked up slightly toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, hinting at dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These combined changes suggest the onset of a more stable, potentially clearer weather regime, though lingering moisture may contribute to early morning fog or low clouds.
