Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating potential for fog or mist formation, before dropping sharply as temperatures rose and air became drier. A significant increase in air pressure occurred during the overnight hours, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that has stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, indicating changing influences in the boundary layer, possibly linked to a frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, clearer, and more stable weather, with minimal risk of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
