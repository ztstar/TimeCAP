Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night, remaining high through the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the morning, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily from mid-morning onward, with stronger winds developing from the southeast to the south, consistent with the circulation around an approaching low-pressure center. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and then to the south further confirms the transition from cold, dry air to warmer, moist air, likely bringing overcast skies and a risk of precipitation in the near term.
