Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, potentially linked to developing thunderstorms. Wind activity was minimal initially but increased later in the night, particularly from the south-southeast, suggesting an inflow of moist air that could support storm development. These conditions together suggest a high likelihood of convective activity in the coming hours, especially as temperatures begin to rise and humidity remains elevated.
