Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the evening and early night, indicating increased moisture in the air, which may contribute to a more oppressive feel and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure consistently increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in airflow that could facilitate moisture transport or influence local storm development. The combination of rising humidity, increasing pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more stable, possibly clearer weather in the coming hours, though lingering moisture may lead to isolated fog or drizzle in the early morning hours.
