Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during midday, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the night, reaching a peak around dawn, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early night, with strong westerly to southwesterly flows preceding the pressure rise, which may have contributed to the cooling and moisture transport. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly in the late afternoon and evening signals a change in airflow, potentially associated with a cold front or marine layer adjustment, which could lead to variable conditions later in the day.
