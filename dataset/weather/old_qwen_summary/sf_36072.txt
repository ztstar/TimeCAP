Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and then steadily declining through the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, remaining elevated through the night, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted into the early hours of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours. Wind speeds dropped significantly during the late night and early morning, almost coming to a standstill, before picking up again in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns possibly influenced by coastal dynamics. The wind direction shifted dramatically from prevailing westerly to southerly and then northerly, reflecting complex interactions between the marine layer and land-based thermal gradients.
