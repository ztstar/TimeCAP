Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day before peaking in the late afternoon, indicating increasing solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during early morning and midday hours, suggesting saturated air conditions that may have contributed to reduced visibility and a sticky feel. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon, followed by a slight recovery, which could signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing instability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, suggesting the influence of a developing or nearby weather disturbance. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and later to westerly patterns indicates changing air mass dynamics, raising the likelihood of thunderstorm development or precipitation in the near term.
