Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily, indicating a shift toward drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather in the near future. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a prevailing southerly to southwesterly flow that likely contributed to the moisture influx and temperature fluctuations. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and persistent winds signals a potential for increasing cloud cover and a higher chance of precipitation in the coming hours.
