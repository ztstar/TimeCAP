Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds during the overnight period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a moist, cool, fog-prone environment toward a drier, more stable atmosphere, which could lead to improved visibility and reduced marine layer conditions in the coming hours.
