Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with overnight cooling. Humidity increased significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture accumulation likely linked to nighttime condensation or nearby weather systems. Air pressure rose steadily through the early morning hours, reaching a peak and then gradually decreasing, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds diminished after midnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation possibly associated with a developing low-pressure influence. Combined, these trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially leading to unstable conditions with increased chances of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
