Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, starting high and dropping sharply during midday, then rising again in the evening, indicating a possible shift in air mass or fog dissipation. Air pressure peaked in the early evening and remained elevated before declining sharply overnight, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably during midday and early evening, with strong westerly to southwesterly winds, which likely contributed to the clearing of fog and mixing of the boundary layer. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind direction points to the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
