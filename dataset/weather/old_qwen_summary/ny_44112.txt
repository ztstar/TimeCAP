Over the past 24 hours, a sustained drop in atmospheric pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, coinciding with near-saturated air and a brief period of precipitation, as evidenced by the sharp pressure decline and stable winds. Temperature trends show a gradual warming, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of milder air masses. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from northerly to southerly directions in the latter half of the period, consistent with a developing frontal system. These combined factors suggest the potential for continued precipitation and variable conditions in the near term, with a possible shift toward more stable weather later in the day.
