Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase in the early morning and late night, suggesting possible moisture accumulation or changes in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, which is typically associated with improving weather and fair conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift from stronger southerly and westerly winds early in the cycle to lighter, more variable winds later, reflecting a stabilization in atmospheric conditions. The consistent wind direction toward the southwest and west during the peak pressure phase implies the influence of a high-pressure system, likely bringing clear skies and stable weather in the near term.
