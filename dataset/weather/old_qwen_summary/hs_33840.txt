Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift from a more saturated air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late night and early morning, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more southeasterly direction overnight, then turned west-southwesterly by late afternoon, consistent with changing synoptic influences. These trends point to a transition period with potential for developing convection, particularly if moisture and instability increase in the coming hours.
