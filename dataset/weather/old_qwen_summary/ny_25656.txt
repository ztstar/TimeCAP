Over the past 24 hours, a sustained cooling trend was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and later from the southwest, indicating a shift in wind patterns consistent with frontal passage. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and shifting wind directions suggests that New York City may be entering a period of unstable weather, potentially bringing precipitation later tonight.
