Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained nearly constant until late evening, when a slight drop occurred, signaling a potential shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction toward the southwest, indicating movement of maritime air masses. These patterns suggest the influence of a coastal fog regime, typical for San Francisco's microclimate, with strong potential for persistent fog and cool, damp conditions into the coming day.
