Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during early hours. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around dawn, with winds strengthening and changing direction from the southwest to the west and then north, indicating a change in local atmospheric circulation. Air pressure exhibited a complex fluctuation, with a major increase mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions later in the day. These dynamics point to a transition from a maritime-influenced, fog-prone environment to a drier, more stable regime, with implications for visibility, comfort, and potential for clear skies later tonight.
