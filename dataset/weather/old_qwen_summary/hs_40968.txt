Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours, indicating increasing solar heating and potential development of convective activity. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from saturated air conditions to drier air, possibly due to a change in air mass or the onset of a dry front. Air pressure showed a noticeable decline toward the end of the period, especially during the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or an incoming weather disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with consistent southerly and easterly flows early on, shifting to more variable and sometimes stronger northerly and westerly directions later, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation. Combined, these trends suggest the potential for unstable conditions, possibly leading to afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if moisture re-enters the lower atmosphere ahead of a frontal boundary.
