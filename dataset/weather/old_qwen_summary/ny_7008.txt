Over the past 24 hours, a noticeable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal cycles and changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during midday, suggesting a shift from stable to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system affecting the region. Wind activity increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by variable wind directions, particularly from the southwest and west, hinting at dynamic air mass interactions. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with the possibility of precipitation or changing conditions in the near term.
