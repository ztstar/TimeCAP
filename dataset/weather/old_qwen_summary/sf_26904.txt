Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels climbed sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, indicating the influence of marine air infiltration typical of the region’s coastal climate. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a strong rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure trough, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and reduced wind speeds. Wind patterns shifted from easterly to southerly and then to more westerly directions, with sustained winds from the southwest in the evening, consistent with a strengthening onshore flow that often brings fog and cooler conditions. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic transition marked by coastal fog development, nocturnal cooling, and the arrival of a moist maritime air mass, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
