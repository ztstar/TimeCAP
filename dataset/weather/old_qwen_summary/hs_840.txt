Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, indicating the arrival of a moist air mass, likely associated with a passing weather front. Air pressure remained relatively stable until midday, then began to rise, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind conditions were nearly calm during the early morning, with winds shifting from southwesterly to variable directions later in the day, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind speeds points to the dissipation of a previous low-pressure system and the onset of more stable, drier conditions later in the day.
