Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery later in the day, indicating a pronounced cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, with a notable drop in relative humidity during the mid-morning before rising again. Air pressure declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds remained light until late afternoon, when they increased notably, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly, reinforcing the influence of a developing synoptic-scale system. These coordinated changes point to a dynamic and transitioning weather pattern, with likely precipitation in the near term and cooler conditions persisting into the following day.
