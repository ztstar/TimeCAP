Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a nightly temperature inversion that broke as the day progressed. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, creating a muggy, oppressive feel, with multiple periods of 100% relative humidity likely contributing to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed convective activity. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with sustained easterly to southeasterly flow during the night transitioning to a more variable, sometimes stronger, westerly component in the late afternoon and evening, which may have brought in drier air. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, with potential implications for air quality and localized storm development later in the day.
