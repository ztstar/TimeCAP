Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicating a clear diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with high values during the early morning hours and a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system or shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with typical afternoon sea breeze development and possible katabatic effects from nearby hills. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the final hours may indicate a change in synoptic conditions, possibly bringing cooler, moister air and increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
