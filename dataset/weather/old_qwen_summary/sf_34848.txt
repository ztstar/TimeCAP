Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling effect. A shift in wind patterns occurred in the late morning, with stronger winds from the northwest during the early hours giving way to lighter, more variable winds later in the day, indicating a possible change in atmospheric stability. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool overnight period to a gradually warming, drier, and more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
