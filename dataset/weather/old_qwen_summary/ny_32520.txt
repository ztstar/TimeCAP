Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours before gradually rising through the afternoon and evening, indicating a nighttime cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels were relatively high in the early hours, dropped significantly during mid-morning and midday, then began to rise again in the late evening, suggesting a drying trend during the day and possible moisture influx later. Air pressure remained stable and gradually increased, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings clear and stable weather. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout most of the period, with a notable calm in the early afternoon, followed by a slight increase in the final hours, potentially indicating a shift in local circulation patterns. Wind direction changed significantly over time, moving from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, which may reflect the influence of a passing weather front or shifting pressure gradients, possibly laying the groundwork for changing conditions overnight.
