Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, followed by a sharp decline during midday, suggesting a shift in moisture content possibly linked to a passing weather front. Air pressure decreased significantly during the late night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is indicative of an approaching or passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late night and early morning, with strong southerly to easterly gusts, likely contributing to both the temperature drop and the mixing of air masses. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather transition, potentially bringing overcast conditions or light precipitation in the near term.
