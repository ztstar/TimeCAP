Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant overnight cooling. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, followed by a sharp decline during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass or clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified during the morning hours, with a notable surge in the early hours, accompanied by a shift from southerly to northeasterly flow, which may have facilitated the movement of moist air inland and subsequent dissipation. The combination of rising pressure, drying air, and shifting winds points to a stable atmospheric regime developing, likely leading to improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
