Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon before rebounding in the evening, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure exhibited a sustained decrease, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and south-southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow typical of tropical moisture incursions. These combined patterns point to a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, particularly as the low-pressure system consolidates and interacts with warm, moist air near the surface.
