Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, especially during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent high-pressure system dominating the region, which generally supports clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong gust in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, signaling potential changes in air mass. These patterns suggest the arrival of a frontal boundary or a shift in circulation, potentially setting the stage for variable or unsettled weather later in the day.
