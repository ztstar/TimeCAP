Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage during the night. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, with a sharp rise during the early morning hours and a dramatic decrease in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a dry air mass following the cold front. Air pressure steadily increased, culminating in a high-pressure system that has settled over the region, signaling improving and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong, particularly during the night, but diminished significantly during the afternoon, coinciding with the shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, consistent with a post-frontal clearing pattern. The combination of falling temperatures, low humidity, rising pressure, and diminished winds points to a transition toward clear, dry, and cooler conditions across New York City.
