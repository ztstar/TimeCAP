Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before leveling off, indicating a strong nocturnal radiative cooling pattern. Humidity remained near or at saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting condensation and the potential for fog formation, which may have impacted visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the late night and early morning hours, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air mass flow, likely associated with a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, though lingering moisture and wind shifts could still support isolated thunderstorm development later in the period.
