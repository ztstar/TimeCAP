Temperature showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a low before rising steadily into the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as daylight advanced. Humidity remained elevated during the early hours, peaking overnight and then gradually decreasing, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system developing, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speed picked up significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and finally to westerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cool night to a drier, warmer day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely leading to improved visibility and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
