Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a gradual回升 during the morning hours, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, reflecting drier air, but began rising again in the late morning, potentially signaling increased moisture availability. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase in the early afternoon, indicating fair weather conditions and minimal likelihood of storm systems. Wind speeds were strongest during the early evening and late night, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to more southerly positions, possibly indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperature and humidity, along with persistent winds from the west-northwest, suggests the potential for developing cloud cover or light precipitation later in the day.
