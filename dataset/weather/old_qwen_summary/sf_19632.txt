Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching a low point before gradually warming slightly toward the end of the period. Humidity levels remained consistently near saturation throughout the day, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a high likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure exhibited a gradual downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early and late hours, with sustained moderate gusts and shifts in wind direction reflecting dynamic atmospheric conditions, including a possible change in airflow pattern. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially overcast, damp conditions with a heightened chance of coastal fog and light precipitation in the near term.
