Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels surged significantly in the overnight hours, peaking during the early morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could bring precipitation. Wind speed increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then easterly, indicating a change in the large-scale flow that may be facilitating air mass movement. Together, these trends suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms in the coming hours, especially given the warm, moist air mass and increasing wind shear, which could lead to localized severe weather if instability intensifies.
