Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a sustained period of near-constant humidity, indicating saturated air conditions likely contributing to persistent overcast skies or fog. Temperature trends revealed a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a cold front that brought cooler conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, a strong indicator of improving weather, with a notable rise late in the cycle pointing toward the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the early hours, shifting to lighter winds later, while wind direction evolved from northwest to nearly north and eventually veered toward the northeast, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined signals suggest a post-frontal environment with clearing skies on the horizon, potentially leading to improved visibility and more stable conditions in the near term.
