Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high through much of the night and early morning, peaking in the mid- to late-night hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred during the morning hours, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, indicating the passage of a weather system, possibly a front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow. These observations suggest the influence of a transient frontal system, potentially bringing cooler, drier air and increasing the likelihood of clearing skies in the coming hours.
