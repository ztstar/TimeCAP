Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking near saturation in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A significant pressure increase occurred in the late evening, signaling the arrival of a stable high-pressure system that has helped clear skies and suppress precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with consistent southerly to southeasterly flow shifting to more westerly directions by midday, suggesting a change in air mass dynamics. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day.
