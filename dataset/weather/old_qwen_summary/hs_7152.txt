Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar radiation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining through the afternoon, suggesting a buildup of moisture overnight. Air pressure exhibited a slight drop in the late evening and early morning, followed by a recovery, which may reflect the passage of a weak weather front or local atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, potentially signaling changing air mass influences. These combined patterns suggest a stable but humid environment with conditions conducive to the development of localized showers or thunderstorms if additional moisture and lift are introduced.
