Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, indicating the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds diminished to near calm conditions during the early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the south and east, possibly signaling changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition period likely influencing coastal conditions, with increased fog and cooler temperatures expected to persist into the next day.
