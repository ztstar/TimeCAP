Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation and remaining elevated through the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low and consistent until midday, when a brief increase in wind intensity occurred, accompanied by a shift in direction from northeasterly to southerly, which may signal a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover, precipitation, or thunderstorm development later in the day.
