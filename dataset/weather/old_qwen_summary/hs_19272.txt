Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures consistently declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels remained elevated, peaking near saturation during the overnight hours, indicating a saturated atmosphere that supports persistent cloud cover and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily decreased, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increasing humidity and unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and east, consistent with a developing moisture-laden inflow. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term, particularly as the low-pressure system continues to influence the region.
