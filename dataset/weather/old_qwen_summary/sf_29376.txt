Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with a sharp drop during midday followed by sharp increases in the evening, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sustained low-pressure anomaly in the late afternoon and early evening, which may have contributed to unstable conditions and gusty winds. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening, particularly during the final hours, driven by strong northerly and westerly components, likely associated with a passing frontal system. These combined patterns point to a transition period marked by coastal instability, potentially leading to variable conditions such as fog, wind gusts, and shifting precipitation risks in the immediate future.
