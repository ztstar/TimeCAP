Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend that culminated in a notable increase in afternoon temperatures. Humidity levels showed pronounced variability, with high moisture content in the early and late night hours, indicating possible condensation or fog formation, while lower levels during midday suggest drier air. A sharp rise in air pressure occurred during the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly northerly to more easterly and southerly directions later in the day, potentially drawing in moist air and influencing humidity trends. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and stable pressure suggests a transition toward warmer, more humid conditions, which may increase the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
