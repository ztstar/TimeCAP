Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought changing weather conditions. Temperature trends showed a gradual warming throughout the day, with a notable rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels displayed a marked contrast, with a sharp increase in the early morning followed by a sudden spike in the mid-morning, pointing to possible fog formation or marine layer development. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to more easterly, signaling dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined changes suggest the arrival of a coastal frontal system, which could lead to cooler, windier conditions and potential for fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
