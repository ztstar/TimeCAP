Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility. Wind activity remained minimal until mid-afternoon, when winds strengthened from the south-southeast, possibly signaling the influence of a developing offshore flow or thermal gradient. These patterns collectively point to a typical diurnal coastal cycle, with marine layer development overnight and subsidence and drying during the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
