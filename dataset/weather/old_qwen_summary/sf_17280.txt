Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained near or at saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog formation, which likely contributed to the lower temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds were generally low, particularly during the night, but increased slightly in the late afternoon, potentially aiding in the dispersion of fog and slight warming. Wind direction remained consistently from the southwest to west-southwest, aligning with typical marine layer patterns, reinforcing the presence of cool, moist air flowing in from the Pacific Ocean.
