Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp spike during the early morning hours, suggesting fog formation or condensation, likely due to cooling surface temperatures. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, contributing to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief periods of increased activity and directional shifts, particularly toward the morning and afternoon, hinting at localized breezes or changes in wind patterns driven by coastal topography. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, fog-prone night to a mild, relatively calm day with improving visibility and stable atmospheric conditions.
