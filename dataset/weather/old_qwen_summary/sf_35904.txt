Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual increase through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling and afternoon solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, signaling the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture common to the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained stable with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the potential approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low at night, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with sea breeze dynamics and possible synoptic influences. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal weather cycle, with high humidity and variable winds likely contributing to persistent fog or overcast conditions in low-lying areas.
