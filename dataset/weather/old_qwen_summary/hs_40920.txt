Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation levels throughout the night, indicating stable, moist conditions conducive to fog or drizzle, which likely contributed to the lack of significant wind during those hours. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest in the late afternoon suggests the arrival of a new air mass, possibly associated with a passing front. Air pressure rose steadily into the early morning, peaked, then declined slightly, hinting at dynamic atmospheric changes that may signal evolving weather patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward drier and more variable conditions, potentially preceding a change in weather over the next 12–24 hours.
