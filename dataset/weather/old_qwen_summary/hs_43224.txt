Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the development of fog or mist in the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, suggesting the onset of a more dynamic air mass. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, drier, and more breezy day, typical of a post-frontal environment in the region.
