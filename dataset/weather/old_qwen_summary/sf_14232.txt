Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and potential fog formation. A notable pressure drop occurred in the early hours, followed by a recovery, which may signal a passing weather system or shifting air masses affecting the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by variable wind directions, with stronger gusts likely driven by localized pressure gradients and topographic effects. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with potential for fog, shifting breezes, and fluctuating temperatures throughout the day.
