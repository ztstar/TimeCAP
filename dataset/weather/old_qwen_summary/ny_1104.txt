Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period before sharply decreasing in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or clearing skies. A sustained increase in air pressure beginning in the late night indicates the arrival of a high-pressure system, associated with stable and likely clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light but increased in the late afternoon, with variable directions indicating possible atmospheric adjustments. These changes collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, leading to improving weather with cooler temperatures and reduced moisture, setting the stage for a drier and more comfortable day ahead.
