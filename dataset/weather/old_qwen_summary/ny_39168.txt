Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning before stabilizing at lower levels. Humidity levels showed a sharp drop during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before rising again in the late evening, indicating a drying air mass followed by potential moisture influx. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, driven by a shift to more westerly and northerly wind directions, consistent with strong pressure gradients. The combination of low humidity, rising pressure, and strong winds suggests a dry, stable, and potentially chilly environment, with minimal precipitation expected in the near term.
