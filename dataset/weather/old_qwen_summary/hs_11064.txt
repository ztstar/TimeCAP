Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually warming. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning, then sharply decreased in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds showed brief spikes during the night and late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that may signal the passage of a weak cold front or localized atmospheric changes. These trends collectively point to a transition from a moist, cool night into a drier, more stable daytime pattern, likely contributing to clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation.
