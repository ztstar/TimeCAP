Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility in the early hours. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midday, with wind speeds increasing substantially and direction changing from southerly to northerly, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then dropped slightly during the afternoon, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day due to high moisture content and increasing wind shear.
