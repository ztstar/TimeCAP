Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture content interspersed with brief drops, indicating intermittent air mass changes. Air pressure demonstrated a steady decline, culminating in a low-pressure trough that likely contributed to unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns revealed alternating periods of calm and modest airflow, with consistent northeasterly to easterly winds during active periods, suggesting possible influence from a coastal breeze or frontal passage. These combined factors point to an evolving weather system that may have facilitated the development of scattered showers or thunderstorms, particularly during the late night and early morning.
