Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the afternoon, indicating a developing high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies later. Wind speeds increased steadily through the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and eventually westerly, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with a passing weather front. These conditions indicate the potential for unsettled weather, including possible thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to build under the influence of the approaching front.
