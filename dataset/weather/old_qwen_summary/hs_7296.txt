Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, indicating the influence of a moist air mass that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the evening and night, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unstable conditions. Wind speeds diminished toward the end of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then westerly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a frontal boundary, with potential for increased cloud cover and a higher chance of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
