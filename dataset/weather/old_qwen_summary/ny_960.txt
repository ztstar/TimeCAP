Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of a passing cold front that has now begun to retreat. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping significantly during the late afternoon, suggesting the clearing of moist air as pressure rose. Air pressure steadily increased over the period, signaling the dominance of a high-pressure system that has brought stabilizing and generally fair conditions. Wind speeds were initially moderate, decreasing to near calm conditions during midday, which likely contributed to the formation of localized fog or low visibility in the early hours. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then back to easterly patterns reflects changing air mass dynamics, with the current calm and clear conditions aligning with a stable, high-pressure environment expected to persist.
