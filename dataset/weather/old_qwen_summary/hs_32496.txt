Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to nocturnal condensation and reduced mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, hinting at the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and later to westerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics and possible synoptic influences. These patterns collectively suggest the presence of a developing moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the coming hours.
