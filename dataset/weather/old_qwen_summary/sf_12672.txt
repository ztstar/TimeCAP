Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist maritime influence to drier air, likely due to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with strong offshore and westerly flows during the night and early morning, shifting to lighter, more variable winds in the afternoon, including a brief lull and a resurgence of winds from the southwest. These dynamics point to a developing weather pattern favoring improved visibility and potentially fog dissipation in the morning hours, with increasing stability expected in the coming hours.
