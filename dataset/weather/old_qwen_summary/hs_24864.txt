Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the passage of a nocturnal temperature inversion and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass and potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a rapid rebound, signaling the influence of a passing weather system—likely a front—impacting the region. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then westerly directions, with increased speeds in the late afternoon, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics associated with the system’s movement. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for unstable conditions, including scattered showers or thunderstorms, particularly in the evening hours.
