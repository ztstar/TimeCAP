Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine layer conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, peaking before declining in the late afternoon, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and a shift toward clearer skies. Wind speeds increased during the morning and late afternoon, with a distinct shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating changing synoptic influences and potential onshore flow. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a warmer, drier, and more stable regime, likely resulting in improved visibility and reduced fog in the coming hours.
