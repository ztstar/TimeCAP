Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a nighttime cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours and remaining elevated during the night, suggesting moisture accumulation associated with cooler conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest and then to southeast, indicating a change in airflow likely tied to the high-pressure buildup. Taken together, these patterns point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, with potential for improving visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
