Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decline in the early morning, indicating the clearing of moisture-laden air, followed by a rebound in the late evening, likely due to increased moisture advection. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which is often associated with stronger synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable regime under the influence of a passing high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions.
