Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling a lack of strong frontal systems but consistent high-pressure influence, contributing to calm and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, likely driven by localized convective activity or changes in surface heating gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors hints at a subtle reorganization of air masses, possibly indicating the onset of a transition phase that could influence afternoon thunderstorm development.
