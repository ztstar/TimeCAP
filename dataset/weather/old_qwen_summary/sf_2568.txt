Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sharp drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, which persisted through mid-morning before gradually decreasing. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the early hours, suggesting the passage of a weather front, which was likely associated with the increased wind activity and shifting wind direction. Wind speeds remained minimal during most of the day, with brief bursts of stronger wind linked to changes in wind direction, particularly from the northwest and later from the south. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and a weakening pressure system points to a coastal influence typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy conditions and a cool, damp feel in the morning hours.
