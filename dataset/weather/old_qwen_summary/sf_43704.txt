Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a stable nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or misty conditions to clearer, drier air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained low and variable during the night, increasing modestly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of a developing offshore flow. These combined trends point to a typical coastal diurnal pattern, with a likely clearing of fog and improving visibility in the coming hours, aligning with a period of stable, dry, and mild weather.
