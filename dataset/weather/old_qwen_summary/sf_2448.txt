Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by coastal cooling and afternoon solar heating. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, with a sharp decline in the middle of the night, suggesting the influence of dry air intrusion, possibly from a subsiding high-pressure system, followed by a rebound in the late afternoon. Air pressure remained consistently high, with a brief spike in the early hours, pointing to stable atmospheric conditions and minimal storm activity. Wind patterns exhibited a strong, consistent flow from the northwest during the early and late periods, with a notable shift in direction and a complete calm in the middle of the night, which may have contributed to localized fog formation and reduced mixing. These patterns collectively reflect a typical marine-layer influence, with coastal breezes, temperature inversions, and fluctuating humidity shaping the city’s microclimate.
