Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moist air masses that may contribute to fog or damp conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry, and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low and steady during most of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast in the late morning and afternoon, potentially indicating a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting winds implies a transition toward more stable but potentially humid conditions, with a reduced likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
