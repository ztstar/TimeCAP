Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a persistent high-humidity environment, with relative humidity consistently near or at saturation levels, indicating significant moisture availability in the atmosphere. Temperature remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations suggesting a balanced thermal regime, though slight cooling trends were observed toward the end of the period. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which often correlates with increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased during the midday and afternoon hours, with a shift toward more southerly and then southerly to westerly wind directions, consistent with inflow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. This combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and persistent southerly winds strongly suggests an elevated risk of thunderstorm development, particularly later in the day.
