Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which began to clear as temperatures increased and humidity decreased in the afternoon. A sharp drop in air pressure early in the morning, followed by a gradual recovery, suggests the passage of a frontal system or low-pressure disturbance, likely contributing to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind patterns showed a shift from steady, moderate southerly to easterly flow during the night, with stronger gusts from the south and west in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in local circulation. These conditions point to a transitional weather period, with lingering marine influence and potential for continued fog or drizzle in the early hours, followed by improving conditions later in the day.
