Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant shift in atmospheric conditions, beginning with stable, cool temperatures and near-saturated humidity levels. A gradual warming trend emerged in the late afternoon, accompanied by a sharp drop in humidity, indicating a transition from foggy, marine-influenced conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and early afternoon, peaking before a notable decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from southwesterly to more variable directions, including strong northerly and easterly components, likely driven by a changing pressure gradient. These changes point to a dynamic weather transition, with potential for clearing skies and increasing windiness later in the day, possibly affecting visibility and outdoor conditions.
