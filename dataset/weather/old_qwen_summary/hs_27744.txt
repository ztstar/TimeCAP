Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or drizzle during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable rise, particularly in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more variable and stronger winds, possibly associated with the boundary of a developing weather front. The wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly and then to more westerly, reflecting changing flow patterns that may precede a change in weather, potentially bringing cooler air or precipitation later in the day.
