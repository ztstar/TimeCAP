Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early hours, reaching saturation before declining sharply, suggesting a period of fog or low clouds that dissipated as conditions stabilized. Air pressure exhibited a marked decrease during the night, with a brief spike in the late afternoon, indicating a passing weather front that influenced local conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly to southwesterly, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow. Together, these patterns point to a transition from marine-influenced, fog-prone conditions to a drier, more stable regime, likely driven by a shift in synoptic-scale wind patterns.
