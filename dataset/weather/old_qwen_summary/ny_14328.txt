Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, indicating a cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiational cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increasing moisture content in the air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline through the night, stabilizing at a slightly lower level by morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low through the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns typical of a developing weather front. These combined factors indicate a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with increased cloud cover and a higher likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
