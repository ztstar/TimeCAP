Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking in the early hours, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to coastal fog formation. Air pressure steadily decreased, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring continued overcast conditions or potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, consistent with a changing pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a developing marine layer and potentially unsettled weather, with fog and cooler conditions likely to persist into the coming hours.
