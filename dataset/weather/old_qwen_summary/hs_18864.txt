Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply as temperatures rose, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has likely brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds remained consistently moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly over the course of the day, suggesting a change in the local wind flow pattern. These combined trends point to a developing high-pressure dominance, which is likely leading to improved daytime conditions and reduced chances of precipitation.
