Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the mid-to-late night, followed by a sharp rise during the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds picked up in the evening and remained elevated through the night, with a strong shift in wind direction from southwest to south-southeast, consistent with a change in air mass and potential onshore flow. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cool, moist, and fog-prone environment to a drier, more stable, and potentially clearer afternoon, with winds moderating toward the end of the period.
