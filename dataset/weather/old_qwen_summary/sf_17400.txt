Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of cool temperatures, with a notable overnight dip followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning to decline, indicating possible fog formation and persistence during the early hours. A consistent drop in air pressure, particularly overnight and into the early morning, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift from a prevailing westerly to a more southerly direction during the early morning, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind patterns points to a high likelihood of foggy conditions and possible drizzle or light precipitation in the coming hours.
