Temperature has shown a steady increase over the past 24 hours, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation for the majority of the period, suggesting high moisture levels, which may contribute to a muggy feel and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of calm and intermittent bursts, while wind direction shifted significantly, including a notable reversal toward the south-southeast in the late hours. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a damp, stable condition to a drier, more stable atmosphere, possibly leading to clearer skies in the coming hours.
