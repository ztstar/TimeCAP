Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds remained low overnight but intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong gust from the west-southwest, suggesting potential atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southwest to northwest and then to the west-southwest may signal changing air masses, possibly hinting at the arrival of a front that could influence storm development later.
