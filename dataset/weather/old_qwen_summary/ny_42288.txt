Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then steadily decreased through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a warming trend. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a brief spike in the early morning and another in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from easterly to northerly and then stabilized, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cooler, more humid night into a drier, warmer day under a stabilizing high-pressure regime, likely leading to clear skies and pleasant conditions in the coming hours.
