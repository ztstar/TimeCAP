Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of dense fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a noticeable drop occurred in the late morning, hinting at a possible shift in weather patterns or approaching frontal influence. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early evening, with strong westerly to southwesterly winds, followed by a rapid decline and a shift to weaker, more variable directions by dawn, consistent with the dissipation of coastal wind patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and fluctuating wind direction points to a strong marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy conditions and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
