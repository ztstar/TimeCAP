Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, indicating dry conditions, which then rebounded sharply in the late evening, suggesting a possible return of moisture. Air pressure rose steadily through the morning and early afternoon, peaking before a sudden drop in the late evening, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong westerly to northwesterly gusts, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. These observations suggest the arrival of a coastal front or marine layer disruption, which could bring cooler, moister air and potential low clouds or fog by morning.
