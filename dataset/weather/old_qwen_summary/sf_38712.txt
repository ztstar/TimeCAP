Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of San Francisco’s microclimate. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, particularly around dawn, likely contributing to dense fog formation, which then dissipated as temperatures rose and winds picked up. A notable pressure rise was observed in the early hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, though a sharp drop later in the day may signal the approach of a weather front. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong, consistent winds from the northwest during the night, followed by a sudden change in direction and a marked decrease in speed during midday, only to return to strong northerly winds in the evening. These dynamics suggest the presence of a coastal upwelling event or a frontal passage, which can lead to cooler conditions and increased fog, especially in low-lying coastal areas.
