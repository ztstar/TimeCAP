Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a warmer daytime phase. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which contributed to a heavy, muggy feel and likely enhanced the potential for localized precipitation. Air pressure increased dramatically in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds remained generally low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics and possible frontal influence. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and consistent wind patterns points to a transition period where conditions are becoming more stable, but lingering moisture may still support isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
