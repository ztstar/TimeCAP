Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked at near saturation during the early hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle, which may have contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northerly, reflecting dynamic atmospheric changes consistent with a frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, cool, and stable period to a drier and more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
