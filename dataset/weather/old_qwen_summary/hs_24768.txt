Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal heating pattern. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early hours, then sharply declined during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moist air, possibly due to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the mid-afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from variable directions to more consistent flow from the west and northwest, potentially bringing drier air into the region. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could influence the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms.
