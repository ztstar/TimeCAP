Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low cloud formation. A consistent drop in air pressure throughout the night and early morning indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, often associated with unstable weather and possible precipitation. Wind speeds remained light until late afternoon, when they increased slightly, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that suggests changing airflow patterns typical of frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with rising humidity, weakening pressure, and increasing wind activity signaling an elevated chance of thunderstorms later in the day.
