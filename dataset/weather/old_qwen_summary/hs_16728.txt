Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening, followed by a steady cooling into the night, indicating a shift from daytime heating to nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or overcast conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but picked up in the afternoon, with a notable change in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to a strong westerly flow, indicating a shift in upper-level circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition in weather dynamics, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
