Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels were generally high during the early morning and late night, indicating potential fog formation, particularly in the early hours when winds were light and stagnant. A notable shift in air pressure occurred around midday, with a rise followed by a sharp drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front that likely brought changing conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the west to the south and then back, indicating dynamic atmospheric flow changes possibly linked to the front. These conditions together point to an unstable period with potential for fog dissipation, a transition in air mass, and variable wind patterns that could influence local microclimates and visibility.
