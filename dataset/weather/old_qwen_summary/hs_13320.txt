Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the midday, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation likely linked to overnight condensation or a shallow boundary layer. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly after midday, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southwest, indicating a potential change in airflow associated with developing storm systems. These combined trends suggest increasing instability and the likelihood of convective activity later in the day or overnight, warranting attention for possible thunderstorms.
