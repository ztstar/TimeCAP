Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a sharp diurnal temperature variation likely due to clear skies and radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the nighttime, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, warmer air. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, peaking just before midnight, which is indicative of the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable during the night to consistent southerly and southwesterly flow in the afternoon, aligning with the development of a more organized air mass. Overall, the data suggests a transition from cool, damp conditions to a drier, more stable atmosphere, with likely improving visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
