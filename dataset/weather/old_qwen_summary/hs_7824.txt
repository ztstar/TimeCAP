Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a marked increase in the early morning hours, followed by a strong surge later in the day, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds remained low overnight but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to the northeast, indicating changing atmospheric circulation. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a developing high-pressure system, likely bringing drier, more stable conditions and reduced cloud cover in the coming hours.
