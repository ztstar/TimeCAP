Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a cold nocturnal period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low-level cloud formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase mid-evening, reaching a peak before a sharp drop in the late afternoon, signaling the passage of a strong high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds decreased steadily throughout the night and into the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southeasterly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a cold, possibly foggy night transitioning into a more unstable and potentially stormy afternoon, with increasing chances of precipitation as the low-pressure system moves in.
