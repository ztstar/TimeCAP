Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, particularly during the overnight period. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought the cooler, damper conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by a shift toward more southerly and southeasterly winds, which likely transported moist air into the region. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind suggests a developing instability, raising the potential for thunderstorm activity later in the day.
