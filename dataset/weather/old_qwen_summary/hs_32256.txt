Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, remaining consistently high through mid-morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase during the late afternoon, signaling the potential influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds were minimal during the early night and morning hours, increasing significantly during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may indicate a change in air mass movement. Collectively, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity.
