Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cooling and daytime warming. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking near 100% and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, muggy feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing modestly during the morning and afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southeasterly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and calm overnight period to a gradually warming and drier afternoon, with conditions becoming more stable as high pressure strengthens.
