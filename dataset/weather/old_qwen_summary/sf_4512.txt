Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase overnight, peaking in the early hours, suggesting fog formation or marine layer development, which later dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure exhibited a fluctuating pattern with a notable rise during the night, stabilizing in the mid-range, consistent with the influence of a weak high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and night, with sustained easterly to southerly winds, contributing to the transport of moist marine air inland. The combination of high humidity, low wind at dawn, and strong nighttime cooling points to the likelihood of dense fog in coastal areas, which may impact visibility and morning commutes.
