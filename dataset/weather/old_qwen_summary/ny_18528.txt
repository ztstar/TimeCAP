Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely associated with a passing cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and late night, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, suggesting increased moisture accumulation and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable increase midday, followed by a sharp spike in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong in the early hours, then diminished significantly during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest a transition from cooler, moist conditions to a drier, more stable regime, likely resulting in improved visibility and settled weather in the coming hours.
