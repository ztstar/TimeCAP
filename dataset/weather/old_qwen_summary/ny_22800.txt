Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred in the afternoon, indicating warming trends likely driven by increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting nocturnal condensation or a low-level moisture influx, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, which correlates with the temperature surge. Air pressure dropped notably in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to southwesterly, consistent with the movement of a frontal system. These combined indicators point to an approaching weather front that could result in precipitation and changing conditions in the coming hours.
