Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, particularly during the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning and remained high through midday, indicating a saturated atmosphere that may have contributed to fog or reduced visibility. A steady decline in air pressure, especially from late morning onward, points to an approaching low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Wind speed increased notably in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, signaling a change in circulation associated with the developing system. These combined factors suggest that New York City is entering a period of potentially unstable weather, including the likelihood of precipitation and stronger winds later in the day.
