Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation during the night and early morning, indicating conditions conducive to fog or dew formation, with sustained high moisture levels continuing into the early afternoon. A marked increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds remained generally low except for a late-hour surge, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to easterly, suggesting a change in air mass influence. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more settled condition, setting the stage for a clearer and more comfortable day ahead.
