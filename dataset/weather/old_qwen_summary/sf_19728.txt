Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with conditions remaining consistently damp, indicating a strong influence from marine air or fog formation. Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern associated with coastal cooling and subsequent warming. Air pressure remained stable and slightly elevated, signaling the presence of a high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm development and contributed to the persistent fog. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow, reinforcing the onshore breeze that typically brings fog and cool air into the region from the Pacific Ocean. Together, these conditions point to a classic coastal marine layer scenario, which is common in San Francisco during the summer months and can lead to cool, foggy mornings and relatively mild afternoons.
