Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, consistent with the onset of precipitation. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and later to more westerly, suggesting a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a period of unstable weather, likely associated with a developing storm system or frontal passage.
