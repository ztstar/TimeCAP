Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler night to a milder day. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely associated with changing air masses. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds varied considerably, with stronger gusts in the morning and late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and eventually southwesterly, signaling dynamic atmospheric adjustments. Overall, the data suggest improving conditions with decreasing moisture and increasing stability, pointing to a likely transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable daytime temperatures.
