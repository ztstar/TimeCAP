Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, reaching saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure initially stabilized, then spiked during the early morning before dropping, signaling a shift in atmospheric dynamics consistent with front passage. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly directions, with increasing speeds in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a developing low-pressure influence. These conditions collectively point to a transition period with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms as instability returns with the warming trend.
