Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then declined sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a warming air mass and possible boundary layer mixing. Air pressure showed a slight rise overnight, stabilizing around mid-morning before gradually dropping in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or shifting frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased during the early morning hours, particularly from the southeast, before diminishing to light and variable winds in the afternoon, with a notable shift in direction from the southeast to the southwest and back to the southeast by evening. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, humid nocturnal boundary layer to a more dynamic daytime regime, potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorm development if sufficient moisture and lift are present.
