Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature fluctuations. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation and may have contributed to a muggy feel in the early morning. A steady increase in air pressure during the mid-to-late afternoon signals the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift from southeasterly to easterly and then southerly directions, indicating a change in airflow patterns possibly associated with a developing sea breeze or frontal passage. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests a transition toward drier and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
