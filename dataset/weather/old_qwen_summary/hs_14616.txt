Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the influence of nocturnal condensation and subsequent mixing. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp increase mid-morning that may indicate the passage of a high-pressure system, contributing to clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds in the late morning and afternoon, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more active daytime environment, potentially setting the stage for localized afternoon thunderstorms.
