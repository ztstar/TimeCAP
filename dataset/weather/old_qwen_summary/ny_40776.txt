Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night before beginning a gradual recovery during the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then began to rise in the late morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, suggesting a change in air mass. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a damp, cool overnight period toward a drier, more stable, and breezy afternoon, with potential for improved visibility and milder conditions in the coming hours.
