Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of daytime solar heating and possible subsidence. Humidity levels remained relatively low through the night and early morning, but sharply increased in the late evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or increased moisture advection. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast to east sectors, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could enhance moisture transport. The combination of rising humidity, weakening pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened potential for thunderstorm development in the near term.
