Temperatures declined steadily throughout the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a prolonged cold period. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, then plummeted sharply in the late morning, suggesting a drying trend following a period of moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend after a mid-night dip, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the early morning, peaking in the late morning and early afternoon before tapering off, with sustained strong winds from the southwest to west sectors. The combination of dropping temperatures, falling humidity, and strengthening winds points to an active cold front passage, likely resulting in crisp, dry air and potentially gusty conditions across the city.
