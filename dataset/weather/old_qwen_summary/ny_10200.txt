Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled conditions to the city. Temperature trends show a gradual warming during the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling again, suggesting a transition from a cold front to a milder air mass. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with a sharp rise in the early morning followed by a notable drop during midday, then a resurgence in the evening, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Wind patterns reveal a shift from northeasterly to southerly/southwesterly flow, particularly in the afternoon and evening, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These combined indicators suggest the city is experiencing a dynamic weather transition, potentially leading to precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
