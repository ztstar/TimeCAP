Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 97% during the early morning, indicating strong moisture accumulation, likely due to marine layer formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and into the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed cloud dissipation. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night and early morning, with winds shifting from a southerly to a more westerly direction during the late morning, signaling a change in air mass flow. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to persistent fog and low cloud cover, which may continue to limit sunshine and maintain cool, damp conditions through the coming hours.
