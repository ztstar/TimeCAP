Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during midday, suggesting the presence of a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing before a slight drop in the late afternoon, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly, potentially indicating changing synoptic influences. These conditions suggest a transition period where a stable high-pressure regime is weakening, possibly paving the way for increased moisture and instability later in the day.
