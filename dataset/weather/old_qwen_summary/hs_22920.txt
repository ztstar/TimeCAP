Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nighttime low temperatures to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and a high likelihood of fog or drizzle during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily after midnight, particularly in the final hours, indicating strengthening surface winds likely driven by pressure gradient changes. These combined factors point to an unstable atmospheric condition, increasing the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
