Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, then declined sharply during the day, suggesting the influence of a warming air mass and reduced moisture content. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking mid-morning before gradually declining, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system or a developing low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, particularly from the south and southeast, followed by a marked decrease at night, consistent with the weakening of daytime thermal convection. The shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to southerly and eventually to northerly patterns reflects changing airflow dynamics, potentially hinting at the movement of a frontal boundary or a shift in regional synoptic conditions.
