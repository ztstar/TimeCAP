Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning to rise again, suggesting a drying trend during the night and re-moistening in the afternoon. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning, then declined slightly, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a notable reduction in the late afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted from northerly to more easterly and southeasterly, hinting at changing air mass influences. These patterns suggest a transition from a drier, cooler night under high pressure to a warmer, more humid daytime, with potential for increasing cloud cover or instability later in the day.
