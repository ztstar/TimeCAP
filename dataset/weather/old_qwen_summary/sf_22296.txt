Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or low stratus cloud formation, consistent with the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a weak low-pressure system that may bring continued overcast conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the day, with a modest increase toward the end, while wind direction shifted from southwest to west-southwest, aligning with typical marine layer flow. These conditions collectively point to a stable marine layer persisting through the night, likely maintaining cool, damp conditions with limited visibility and an elevated chance of fog in coastal and low-lying areas.
