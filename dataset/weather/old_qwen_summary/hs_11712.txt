Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late evening and early morning, which suggests a saturated air mass conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the arrival of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds gradually intensified through the night, shifting from light easterly flows to stronger westerly and northwesterly winds in the early morning, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
