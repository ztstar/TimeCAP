Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with sharp spikes during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, particularly around dawn, followed by a marked desiccation during the afternoon. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a pronounced drop in the early hours, likely associated with a passing frontal system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind speeds increased substantially during the overnight and early morning periods, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including easterly and southerly flows, consistent with onshore breezes and coastal influences. These combined factors point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern, with fog, variable winds, and shifting pressure systems contributing to a cool, damp, and somewhat unsettled atmosphere.
