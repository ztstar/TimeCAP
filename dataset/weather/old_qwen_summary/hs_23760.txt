Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nocturnal cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before beginning a notable decline, which suggests the atmosphere was near saturation during the cooler part of the day. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and midday, reaching a peak before a sharp drop in the late evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more southeasterly and then easterly, consistent with changing pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and wind shifts points to an evolving synoptic pattern that may bring unsettled conditions, including a potential for thunderstorms, in the near future.
