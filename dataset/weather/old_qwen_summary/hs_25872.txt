Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern, likely driven by clear skies and increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, dropping sharply in the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting the influence of convective activity and potential evening cloud development. Air pressure showed a notable increase midday, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system or an evolving low-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast, suggesting the arrival of a maritime air mass and possible instability. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the final hours, coupled with rising humidity and declining pressure, points to a potential weather change, possibly including the development of thunderstorms later in the night.
