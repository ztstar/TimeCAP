Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a passing weather front, possibly associated with coastal fog and unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a brief lull in the mid-morning hours, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly, aligning with typical marine layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, low pressure, and stable air masses points to a persistent marine layer, which will likely continue to influence coastal conditions with foggy mornings and cool temperatures.
