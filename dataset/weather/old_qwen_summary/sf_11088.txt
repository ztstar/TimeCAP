Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, remaining low during the day but spiking sharply during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation. Air pressure fluctuated slightly, with a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, which could indicate the approach of a weather system or a shift in local atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of calm and occasional shifts in direction—most notably a sudden change to the southeast in the late evening, possibly signaling a shift in prevailing wind patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition period marked by increasing moisture, cooling temperatures, and subtle atmospheric instability, potentially leading to foggy conditions or a change in weather later in the day.
