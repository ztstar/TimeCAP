Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend that likely followed a shift in air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with changing wind patterns. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with a brief spike midday followed by a gradual decline, signaling possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, which may have contributed to the warming and drying observed. These combined trends suggest the passage of a weather system that brought variable conditions, potentially leading to clearer skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
