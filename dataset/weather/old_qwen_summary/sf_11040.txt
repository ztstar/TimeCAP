Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during most of the day but spiked dramatically during early morning and late evening hours, indicating possible fog formation or marine layer influence. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improving conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with shifts in wind direction from offshore to onshore patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, typical of a clearing fog event typical in the region during late summer.
