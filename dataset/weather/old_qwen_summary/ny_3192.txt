Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, indicating a warming trend from early morning into the afternoon, with a significant rise in the latter half of the period. Humidity levels rose steadily, peaking at saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure declined consistently, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with stormy or unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts and periods of calm, though directional shifts—particularly from southerly to northerly and then easterly—indicate changing airflow patterns typical of a developing weather disturbance. These combined factors point to an elevated risk of rain or thunderstorms, particularly in the evening and overnight hours.
