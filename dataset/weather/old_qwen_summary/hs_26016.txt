Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked at near-saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting conditions conducive to fog or dew formation, which later declined as temperatures rose. A notable shift in wind direction from the south to the east and then to the northeast in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a weakening frontal boundary or changing local circulation patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a gradual decline, hinting at potential instability or an incoming system. Combined with increasing wind speeds and shifting wind directions in the evening, these patterns suggest a transitional weather phase, possibly setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
