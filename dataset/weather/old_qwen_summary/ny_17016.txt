Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting warming trends during daytime hours, though a sharp rise in humidity during early morning hours points to potential moisture accumulation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south-southeast sectors, which may contribute to the influx of moist air and enhance instability. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the final hours aligns with a typical pattern preceding frontal passage, indicating possible precipitation development. Combined with the sustained high humidity and falling pressure, these trends suggest a high likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
