Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a steady recovery through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant cooling overnight. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early hours but surged in the late morning, holding high into the afternoon before declining slightly, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a weather front. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with brief increases in the early morning and late afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, potentially contributing to the mixing of air and the clearing of fog. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and changing wind patterns points to a transition from cool, foggy conditions to clearer, drier air, consistent with the typical afternoon break in San Francisco’s marine layer.
