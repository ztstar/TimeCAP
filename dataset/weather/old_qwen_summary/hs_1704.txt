Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, potentially clearer air. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the night and early morning, culminating in a high-pressure ridge, which likely contributed to stable, fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the day, with a notable reduction in the late afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted from predominantly northerly to more easterly and southerly, indicating a change in upper-level flow. These patterns together suggest a weakening cold front or a post-frontal clearing trend, leading to improving conditions with lower humidity and stable air.
