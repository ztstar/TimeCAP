Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined overnight before gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by warming as daytime progressed. Humidity increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before decreasing during the afternoon, suggesting a moist air mass was present and subsequently cleared. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased during the early and late parts of the day, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest toward the west and then to the northwest, indicating changing air flow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, possibly heralding unsettled or changing weather, including potential precipitation, in the coming hours.
