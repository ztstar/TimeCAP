- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in the number of specimens tested, reflecting increasing respiratory activity. A notable acceleration in growth is evident in the final five weeks, suggesting a sharp rise in influenza detection, possibly signaling the onset or peak of a seasonal outbreak. The absence of decline or plateauing indicates that current surveillance efforts are detecting a growing burden of influenza, warranting heightened public health preparedness and intervention.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked intensification in the final quarter of the period, suggesting a rapidly growing influenza A burden. The sharp increase in the most recent weeks, particularly a dramatic spike from the previous week, indicates a possible surge in circulation, potentially signaling the onset or peak of an influenza season. This trajectory raises significant public health concerns, warranting heightened surveillance, preparedness, and potential intervention strategies to mitigate community transmission and healthcare system strain.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp increase in the final five weeks, suggesting the onset of a significant influenza B surge. The progression from moderate levels to a dramatic peak indicates a growing public health concern, likely driven by increased transmission and possibly waning immunity or new viral variants. This pattern underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, resource allocation, and public health messaging to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapid increase in influenza activity. The sharp rise from the 16th to the 20th week indicates a possible peak in the current influenza season, with the most recent values significantly exceeding prior levels and signaling heightened transmission. This pattern implies growing public health concern and the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, resource allocation, and potential intervention strategies to mitigate spread and impact.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, transitioning from low baseline levels to a sharp increase in recent weeks, indicating a significant surge in influenza A positivity. The most notable acceleration occurred in the final five weeks, with a dramatic increase that suggests the onset of a high-intensity influenza season. This pattern implies growing community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting heightened surveillance and public health preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final six weeks, suggesting a significant and intensifying influenza B circulation. The sharp increase from the mid-point onward, culminating in a peak, indicates the onset of a robust seasonal surge, potentially surpassing historical thresholds. This pattern signals growing public health concern, warranting heightened surveillance, resource allocation, and possibly targeted interventions to mitigate transmission and clinical impact.
