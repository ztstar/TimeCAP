Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, shifting from a northerly to a more easterly and southerly direction by mid-morning, which may influence the movement of air masses. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and lingering high humidity suggests improving conditions with potential for clearing skies in the coming hours.
