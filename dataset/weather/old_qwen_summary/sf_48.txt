Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again. A marked increase in humidity occurred in the early hours, peaking at near saturation levels, which coincided with calm wind conditions and likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure saw a notable spike during the early morning, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm or light winds, but began to strengthen in the afternoon, particularly from the south and southeast, signaling a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined changes indicate a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable night to a gradually warming and more dynamic daytime pattern.
