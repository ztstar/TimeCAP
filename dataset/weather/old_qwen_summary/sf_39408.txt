Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during midday, suggesting drier air masses moving in, which may have suppressed cloud formation and contributed to clearer skies. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to southeasterly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These patterns suggest a transition period, potentially bringing increased cloud cover and a higher chance of coastal fog or light precipitation in the coming hours.
