Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained low through the night and early morning but surged significantly in the late night, indicating the arrival of moist air, likely associated with a developing weather system. Air pressure showed a stable baseline until midday, when a notable drop occurred, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, suggesting the influence of a frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to an active weather transition, increasing the likelihood of rain or storms in the near term.
