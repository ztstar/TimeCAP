The temperature has shown a steady decline through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually warming in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of urban environments. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting increased moisture availability, possibly due to condensation or reduced air mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the early hours followed by a gradual recovery, which may indicate a passing weather front. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, shifting from a westerly to a more southerly and then a northerly direction in the afternoon, hinting at a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends suggest the passage of a cold front, with cooling temperatures, increasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns likely contributing to a transition toward more unsettled weather in the coming hours.
