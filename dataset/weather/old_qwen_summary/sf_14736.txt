Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests fog formation or dense low cloud cover, typical of the region’s microclimate. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, followed by a recovery later in the day, indicating the passage of a weather system, possibly associated with marine layer dynamics. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, suggesting shifting airflow patterns influenced by local topography. These conditions point to the presence of a strong marine layer, likely contributing to cool, foggy mornings and a gradual clearing later in the day as pressure stabilizes and winds shift.
