Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooling overnight and warming during the day. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase and subsequent drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor rise early in the period and a slight decline later, reflecting stable atmospheric conditions with no strong frontal influence. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a transition from southerly to westerly and then northerly, which may indicate a change in local air mass. These trends point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially conducive to clearing skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
