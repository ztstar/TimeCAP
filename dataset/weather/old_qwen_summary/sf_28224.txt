Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a period of persistent high humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Temperature remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong heating or cooling influences. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early evening, followed by a gradual rise, signaling the passage of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly during late evening and early morning hours, with the strongest gusts coming from the southwest, consistent with marine layer dynamics and offshore flow. The shift in wind direction from the south-southeast to the southwest and later to the west-southwest aligns with changing pressure gradients and may indicate a transition in local wind patterns affecting coastal conditions.
