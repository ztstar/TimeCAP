Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, with values consistently near or at saturation levels, indicating a moisture-laden atmosphere conducive to fog or low clouds. Temperature remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a slight cooling trend in the late evening, suggesting a stable boundary layer. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that may be bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stagnant environment toward a more stable and gradually clearing pattern, though residual moisture may persist into the early morning hours.
