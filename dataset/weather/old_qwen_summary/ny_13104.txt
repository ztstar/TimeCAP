Temperature trends indicate a steady cooling overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle typical of early autumn. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining through the day, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night, reaching a peak in the early morning, followed by a decline through the afternoon, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and decreased to near calm in the midday, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late afternoon, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition period in New York City’s weather, potentially leading to unstable conditions or a shift toward precipitation later in the day.
