Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining through the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, remaining high during the night and early morning, then dropping during the day before rebounding in the evening, suggesting possible fog formation and dissipation cycles. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with minor increases in the late afternoon, indicating a weak high-pressure influence that may have contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning hours, with strong westerly and southwesterly flows, likely driven by coastal dynamics and the influence of the Pacific Ocean. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate.
