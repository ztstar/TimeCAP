Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting a period of high moisture followed by drying air, possibly due to warming and increased ventilation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with occasional gusts, and wind direction underwent a notable shift from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cooler, moist air mass to a drier, more stable one, likely leading to clear skies and pleasant conditions in the near term.
