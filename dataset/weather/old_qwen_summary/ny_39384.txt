Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low-lying clouds that likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is consistent with deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, peaking in the early hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to easterly, hinting at a developing storm system. These combined factors point to an active weather front moving through the region, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially disruptive conditions in the near term.
