Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the early morning before declining in the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity, consistent with stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period during mid-morning, followed by a brief resurgence in the late afternoon, likely due to localized thermal effects or changes in surface wind patterns. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and potentially signaling the influence of coastal topography on airflow.
