Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warmer, more dynamic phase. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to radiative cooling. Air pressure showed a slight decline, particularly in the late evening and early morning, hinting at a developing low-pressure system or approaching frontal passage. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, consistent with the influence of a moist onshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and the combination of rising temperatures and high humidity indicate a growing potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially later in the day.
