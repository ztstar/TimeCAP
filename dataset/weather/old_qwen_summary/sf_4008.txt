Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal cooling phase and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or high moisture content, which is consistent with the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the early morning, followed by a sustained high-pressure system that brought stable conditions and limited cloud development. Wind patterns shifted from calm to stronger offshore flows during the afternoon, with increased wind speeds and a change in direction pointing toward the Pacific, likely contributing to clearing skies. The combination of rising pressure, falling humidity, and strengthening winds suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation.
