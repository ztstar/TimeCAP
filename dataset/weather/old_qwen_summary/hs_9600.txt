Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before beginning to fall, indicating a period of saturated air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely brought unstable conditions and a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night, but a sudden increase in the late afternoon coincided with a change in wind direction, possibly signaling the influence of a new air mass or frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
