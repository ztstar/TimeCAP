Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Humidity levels showed a marked fluctuation, peaking in the early morning and late night before dropping significantly during midday, suggesting intermittent moisture influx and subsequent drying. Air pressure has been consistently rising, especially in the latter half of the period, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and overnight hours, accompanied by a dramatic shift in wind direction—from predominantly southerly to northeasterly—indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a cooler, drier, and more stable air mass, likely bringing clearer skies and more settled conditions in the near term.
