Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend began in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping rapidly as temperatures increased, suggesting the presence of overnight condensation or fog followed by clearing skies. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening, pointing to an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly and then easterly, consistent with the influence of an advancing weather front. These combined signals suggest that New York City is likely entering a period of changing weather conditions, with potential for precipitation and gusty winds in the near term.
