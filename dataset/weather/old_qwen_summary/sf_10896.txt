Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the early to mid-night hours but spiked significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the arrival of moist air, likely from marine inflow. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief increases at night and early morning, while wind direction shifted notably from westerly to southerly and easterly, reflecting changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward more stable, coastal-influenced weather with increasing humidity and potential for early fog or low stratus development later in the day.
