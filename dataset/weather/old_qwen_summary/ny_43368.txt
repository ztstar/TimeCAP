Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking above 85% and remaining elevated, indicating a moist air mass influence. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the northwest and west, consistent with changing frontal dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the city experienced a transition through a damp, unstable air mass, with potential for precipitation or overcast conditions in the near term.
