Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a steady warming through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles. Humidity remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating potential for fog or mist, which then decreased during midday before rising again in the evening. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, consistent with inflow ahead of an approaching weather front. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward potentially stormy conditions later in the day, with increased chances of precipitation and gusty winds.
