Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a strong increase during the early morning hours, hinting at the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with a sudden increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which may indicate the onset of a sea breeze or a change in synoptic-scale flow. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a fog-prone, stable coastal environment to a drier, more variable regime, potentially signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure ridge over the region.
