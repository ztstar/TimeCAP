Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during the early morning hours, which was followed by a recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of changing air masses and possible clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the midday and afternoon, signaling the approach and arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with sustained higher velocities from the southwest to west-southwest directions, likely contributing to the mixing and dispersion of moisture and pollutants. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and consistent wind patterns points to improving weather conditions, likely resulting in clearer skies and more comfortable daytime temperatures in the near term.
