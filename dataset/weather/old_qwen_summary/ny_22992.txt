Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a low-pressure system or precipitation event. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and potentially unsettled period to improving conditions with drier air and stronger winds.
