Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery later in the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend with a warming rebound. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the late evening, which suggests increasing moisture in the air and potential for fog or low visibility during the night. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly, consistent with the influence of an approaching frontal system. Together, these patterns indicate a transition toward more unstable and potentially rainy conditions in the near term.
