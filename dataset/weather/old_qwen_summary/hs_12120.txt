Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours and remained elevated through the early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast, suggesting a developing circulation pattern favorable for thunderstorm development. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south and later to the west-southwest indicates the influence of a changing frontal system, raising the likelihood of precipitation and unstable weather in the near term.
