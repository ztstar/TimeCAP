Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining during midday, suggesting a shift in air mass. A steady decline in air pressure early in the period, particularly through the night, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the southeast, which may have contributed to the cooling and moisture influx. The change in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more northerly sectors aligns with the movement of the low-pressure system, potentially signaling the arrival of cooler, drier air and possible precipitation later in the day.
