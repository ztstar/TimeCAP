Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery into the afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the overnight period, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic drop during mid-morning, followed by a rebound, which is characteristic of a passing frontal system or low-pressure disturbance that may have brought transient weather changes. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly, consistent with a change in large-scale flow possibly associated with the approaching system. These combined indicators suggest that Houston likely experienced a brief period of unstable weather, possibly including thunderstorm activity, with implications for localized precipitation and potential for continued atmospheric variability in the near term.
