Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from a cooler, stable period to a more variable regime. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, spiking significantly before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass or the arrival of a drier influence. A marked decrease in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a rapid rebound, signaling the passage of a weather system—likely a low-pressure disturbance—that brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including southerly and westerly flows, consistent with a frontal passage or coastal influence. The combination of fluctuating pressure, wind shifts, and humidity changes suggests a dynamic weather pattern, potentially leading to increased chances of fog, light precipitation, or changing conditions in the coming hours.
