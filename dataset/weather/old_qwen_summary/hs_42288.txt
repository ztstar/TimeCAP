Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more convective air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to easterly directions, with increased speeds in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or a change in regional airflow. These combined factors suggest a drying trend and improved atmospheric stability, which may suppress thunderstorm development but could also lead to higher heat retention during the day.
