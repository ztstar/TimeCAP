Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon—a pattern consistent with the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a steady increase throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development and contributed to clearing skies. Wind speeds diminished overnight, reaching a minimum during the early morning hours, before increasing in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, which may signal a change in flow patterns near the coast. Together, these trends point to a transition from a foggy, cool marine layer to a clearer, warmer afternoon, characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
