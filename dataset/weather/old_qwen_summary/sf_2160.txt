Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining high through the early morning before dropping slightly in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased moisture and cloud cover. Wind patterns were generally light and variable overnight, with a brief surge in speed and a change in direction during the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in local wind dynamics. These combined factors suggest the onset of a more maritime and potentially foggy influence, consistent with typical coastal conditions in the region.
