Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift from nocturnal temperature decline to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system approaching, which may signal the potential for developing storms or unsettled weather.

These combined trends suggest the onset of a dynamic weather pattern, with increased instability and potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
