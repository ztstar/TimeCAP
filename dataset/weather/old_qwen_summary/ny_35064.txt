Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity remained high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moist air infiltration and potential for fog or low cloud cover during the night. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and remained low through the early morning, but a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then to easterly suggests changing air mass dynamics. Combined, these trends point to a developing weather system that could result in precipitation and cooler, more unstable conditions later in the day.
