Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable to a more dynamic thermal environment. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and a high likelihood of fog or low clouds during early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low and variable through the night, but a sudden spike in the late afternoon was accompanied by a shift in wind direction, potentially indicating the influence of a developing local convective system or gust front. Together, these trends suggest the atmosphere was primed for potential afternoon thunderstorms, with the combination of high moisture, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns creating an unstable environment.
