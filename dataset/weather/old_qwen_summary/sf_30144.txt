Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity remained near saturation during early hours, then dropped significantly during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a shift in moisture dynamics likely tied to changing wind patterns. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the night, followed by a sharp rise, which may signal the passage of a weather front or pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, potentially indicating the influence of a coastal breeze or an approaching system. These combined indicators point to a dynamic transition in local weather conditions, with potential for fog dissipation and changing cloud cover in the coming hours.
