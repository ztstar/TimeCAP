Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting increased moisture content in the air during the night and a drying trend as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to more southerly in the late evening, which may signal a change in air mass or the influence of a developing local circulation. Overall, the conditions point to a transition toward more stable and dry weather, with potential for clearer skies and comfortable daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
