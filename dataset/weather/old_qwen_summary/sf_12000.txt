Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the late night and early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation, particularly around dawn. Air pressure remained consistently high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, especially around 00:00–03:00, when calm conditions allowed fog to persist, followed by a gradual increase in wind activity later in the day. The shift in wind direction from westerly to variable and then back to easterly suggests changing local flow patterns, potentially bringing clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
