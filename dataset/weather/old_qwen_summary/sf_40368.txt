Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, peaking near saturation, then dropped significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure showed a sustained drop through the night and early morning, followed by a sharp rise midday, indicating the influence of a passing low-pressure system that gave way to a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds remained low overnight, increasing in the afternoon with variable but predominantly southerly to westerly directions, consistent with coastal breeze patterns. The overall pattern points to a transition from a maritime-influenced, fog-prone environment to clearer, drier conditions, with potential for improved visibility and more stable weather in the coming hours.
