Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dipping in the mid-morning, indicating possible nocturnal condensation and subsequent drying. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief increases in the late night and early morning, accompanied by variable wind directions that suggest shifting local flow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier and more stable air, reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms but potentially increasing the risk of heat retention during daytime hours.
