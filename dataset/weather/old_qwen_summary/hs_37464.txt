Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature rise during the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, followed by a sharp decline as the day progressed, likely due to warming and mixing of the boundary layer. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, with a notable drop in the afternoon, pointing to an approaching low-pressure system that may bring storm activity. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and eventually westerly, consistent with the inflow around a developing storm system. These combined trends signal an active weather pattern, with high potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the coming hours, particularly given the convergence of high moisture, decreasing pressure, and strong wind shear.
