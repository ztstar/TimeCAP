Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning hours, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the middle of the night, suggesting dry air intrusion, before sharply rising in the early morning, likely due to increased moisture and a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night, culminating in a peak before gradually declining, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night, with a notable drop to near calm conditions during the early hours, followed by a resurgence later in the period, potentially signaling a change in weather dynamics. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting a complex transition in airflow that may precede changing weather conditions, including possible precipitation.
