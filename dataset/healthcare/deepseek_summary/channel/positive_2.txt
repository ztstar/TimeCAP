- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a consistent and significant upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in growth during the final quarter of the period, suggesting increasing respiratory influenza activity. The data reveals a sharp increase in testing volume, particularly in the most recent weeks, which may reflect either a surge in influenza cases or enhanced surveillance and testing capacity. This sustained upward trajectory raises concerns about potential strain on healthcare systems and underscores the urgency for proactive public health measures to mitigate further spread.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a clear and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked intensification in the latter half of the period, suggesting a rapidly growing influenza A activity. A significant inflection point occurs around week 15, where the rate of increase sharply accelerates, indicating a transition from moderate to high-level transmission. This pattern implies an ongoing, sustained surge in influenza A cases, which may strain healthcare resources and underscore the urgency for enhanced surveillance, public health messaging, and preparedness measures.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked intensification in the latter half, suggesting a significant and ongoing increase in influenza B activity. The emergence of a sharp spike in the final weeks indicates a potential peak in circulation, possibly signaling the onset of a severe seasonal outbreak. This trajectory underscores the need for heightened surveillance, preparedness in healthcare systems, and timely public health interventions to mitigate potential strain on resources.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a pronounced increase in the latter half, signaling a significant surge in influenza positivity. The transition from moderate levels to a steep rise, particularly in the final five weeks, suggests the onset of a strong seasonal peak or potential outbreak. This pattern warrants heightened surveillance and preparedness for increased respiratory illness burden in the population.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the latter half, signaling a significant and rapidly increasing burden of influenza A activity. The transition from low baseline levels to a sharp rise—particularly in the final five weeks—suggests the onset of a strong seasonal influenza wave, potentially indicating widespread community transmission. This pattern warrants urgent public health attention, as the magnitude and pace of increase could strain healthcare resources and underscore the need for enhanced surveillance, vaccination efforts, and clinical preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked shift from low baseline levels to significantly elevated positivity rates in the final weeks. A notable inflection point occurs around week 15, followed by a sharp increase that suggests the onset of a dominant influenza B activity peak. This pattern indicates a growing public health concern, warranting intensified surveillance, preparedness for increased healthcare demand, and timely implementation of preventive measures.
