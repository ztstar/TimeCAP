Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, remaining consistently high until mid-morning before sharply declining, indicating a potential shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with increasing instability. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, signaling changing circulation patterns linked to the approaching system. These combined indicators point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions favoring the potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers later in the day.
