Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and overnight, peaking near saturation, which increases the likelihood of fog or drizzle in the early hours. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, culminating in a low-pressure system that likely intensified storm activity, particularly during the late evening. Wind speeds increased substantially after midnight, with strong gusts observed, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to an active weather system moving through the region, potentially bringing thunderstorms or heavy rain, especially in the early morning hours.
