Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in air pressure, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought changing weather conditions. Temperatures steadily decreased through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rise, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase, possibly due to shifting wind patterns. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the late afternoon, which may have contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late evening, with wind direction shifting from northwest to more variable and southerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, consistent with typical coastal influences, and may herald a shift toward more unstable or potentially rainy conditions in the near term.
