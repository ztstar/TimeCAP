Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a steady rise through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a developing warming pattern. Humidity levels exhibited a significant spike during the early morning hours, suggesting possible fog or condensation, which later fluctuated with brief dry intervals. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable drop in the mid-afternoon, followed by a recovery, hinting at shifting atmospheric conditions that could signal an incoming weather change. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the day, with brief increases in the late afternoon, and wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the weather, potentially leading to unsettled conditions later in the day.
