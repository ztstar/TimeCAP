Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift in thermal conditions likely tied to changing air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking and remaining elevated, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low cloud formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a weakening of wind speeds, pointing to the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation that may have brought in marine air and contributed to the cooling and moisture buildup. These combined factors suggest the onset of a coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with possible fog development and unsettled conditions in the near term.
