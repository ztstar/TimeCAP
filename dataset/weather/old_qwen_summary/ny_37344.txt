Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the early morning hours before stabilizing, indicating a prolonged cold trend likely driven by a persistent cold air mass. Humidity levels showed a sharp spike during the night, particularly in the early hours, which aligns with the temperature drop and suggests the potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early afternoon and declined significantly overnight, with wind direction shifting from northwest to more variable, including southerly components, hinting at changing air flow patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising pressure, and reduced wind suggests a stable, cold, and likely dry weather pattern is now in place across New York City.
