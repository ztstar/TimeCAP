Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, suggesting persistent marine influence and limited drying, likely due to fog or low cloud cover. Temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling through the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise during the late morning and afternoon, consistent with diurnal heating under a stable marine layer. Air pressure remained largely stable, with a brief drop and sustained low values, indicating a stable but potentially weakening high-pressure system that may allow for gradual changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with calm conditions prevailing from late night into early morning, followed by a resurgence of light to moderate winds in the afternoon, possibly signaling a shift in surface flow. Wind directions consistently came from the southwest to west sectors, reinforcing the presence of a coastal maritime airflow, which supports the ongoing influence of the Pacific Ocean on local conditions.
