Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning and declined steadily through the day, suggesting a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure showed a slight increase in the early hours, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow, promoting moisture transport and contributing to the humid conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
