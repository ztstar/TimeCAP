Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the clearing of overnight moisture and the arrival of drier air. Air pressure showed a slight dip in the early hours, followed by a recovery and stabilization, implying a passing weather system with no strong low-pressure development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest, which may have contributed to the drying trend and enhanced air mixing. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing milder and drier conditions, with implications for improved visibility and comfort in the coming hours.
