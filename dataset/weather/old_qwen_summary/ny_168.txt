Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels remained high overnight, especially in the early hours, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, before decreasing significantly during the day as air warmed and mixing increased. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, then diminished noticeably during midday, with a shift in wind direction from west-northwesterly to southerly in the evening, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cooler, humid, and potentially overcast night to a drier, clearer, and more stable daytime atmosphere, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge.
