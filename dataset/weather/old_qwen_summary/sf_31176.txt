Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating the passage of a nocturnal temperature inversion. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and fog formation. Air pressure displayed a steady increase, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, reflecting the buildup of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, persistent winds from the southwest and west, likely driven by coastal pressure gradients and enhanced by the city’s topography. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the early morning hours, combined with the return of lower humidity and rising temperatures, points to the dissipation of marine layer conditions and a transition toward drier, more stable air.
