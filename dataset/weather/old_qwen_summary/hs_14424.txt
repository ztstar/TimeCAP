Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night, indicating a transition toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation levels, which suggests increased potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a moderate but consistent increase, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a notable lull around the middle of the night, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. The wind direction exhibited variability, with southerly and easterly flows dominating, which may reflect moisture-laden air advection from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the high humidity and potential for localized showers.
