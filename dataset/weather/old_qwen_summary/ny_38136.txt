Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely due to the influence of a cold air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with storm development. These conditions collectively point to an evolving storm system that could result in precipitation and potentially disruptive conditions in the coming hours.
