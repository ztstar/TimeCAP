Temperatures showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a low before gradually rising through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early hours, peaking at saturation before steadily decreasing, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation during the night. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, potentially indicating the influence of a developing storm system. Taken together, these patterns point to a dynamic weather transition, with conditions likely becoming less stable, increasing the risk of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
