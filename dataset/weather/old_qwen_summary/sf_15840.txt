Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, reaching a high before slightly declining, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought more stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds dropped dramatically after midnight, with near-calms reported for several hours, likely due to the weakening of offshore flow and the establishment of a more localized, less dynamic circulation. The change in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests shifting synoptic patterns, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather regime that could influence coastal fog and temperature patterns in the coming hours.
