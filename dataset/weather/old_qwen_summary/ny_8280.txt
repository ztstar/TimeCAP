Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a significant cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a dramatic rise in the afternoon, reflecting the arrival of a strong high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable weather. Wind speeds increased steadily through the evening and into the night, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with the influence of an approaching high-pressure ridge. These indicators collectively point to a transition from a damp, cooler period to a drier, more stable, and likely sunny afternoon and evening.
