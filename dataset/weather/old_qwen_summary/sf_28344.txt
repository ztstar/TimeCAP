Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the early morning hours and remaining elevated in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a complex pattern, with a sharp drop followed by a recovery, indicating possible passage of a weather front or shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly, which may signal changing air mass influences. These dynamics collectively suggest a period of unstable weather, likely contributing to fog development and variable conditions, particularly during the overnight hours.
