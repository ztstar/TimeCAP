Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increasing moisture in the lower atmosphere and potential for condensation or fog. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the early morning, with strong southerly to southeasterly flow developing, carrying moist air inland and enhancing the potential for thunderstorm development. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west in the late evening, combined with the pressure drop and high humidity, indicates a developing weather disturbance that could lead to thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
