Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A steady drop in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, indicating the onset of a frontal passage. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with the possibility of precipitation and gusty conditions later in the day.
