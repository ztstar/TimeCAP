Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise from early morning lows to midday highs, indicating a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting moist air persistence, which may contribute to fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and shifting wind directions, pointing to the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to more variable and stronger from the west and northwest, consistent with storm development or frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest the potential for deteriorating weather conditions, including possible precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
