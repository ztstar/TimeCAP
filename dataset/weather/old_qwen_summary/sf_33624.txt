Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily declining, suggesting the presence of marine layer conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase overnight, stabilizing at a high level, which is consistent with the buildup of a high-pressure system contributing to clear skies and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong southerly and westerly flows, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the coastal upwelling and offshore breezes. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the afternoon, combined with decreasing wind speeds, points to a weakening of the marine influence and a transition toward more settled weather conditions.
