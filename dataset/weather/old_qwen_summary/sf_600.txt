Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of low-level moisture, likely due to increasing solar heating. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the late night and early morning, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system that may influence upcoming weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a stable, marine-influenced environment to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled atmospheric condition.
