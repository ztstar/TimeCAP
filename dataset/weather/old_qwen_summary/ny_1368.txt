Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation around midday, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during the early hours. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, signaling a change in air mass and potential for precipitation. These combined trends point to a transition period where lingering moist conditions may give way to drier, more stable weather later in the day.
