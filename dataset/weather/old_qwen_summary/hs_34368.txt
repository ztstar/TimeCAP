Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and humidity declined in the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then gradually increased through the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were low and variable overnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly in the early morning, followed by a strengthening southeasterly flow later in the day. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a warmer, drier, and more ventilated daytime condition, consistent with a developing fair-weather regime.
