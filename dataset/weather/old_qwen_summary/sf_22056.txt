Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating conditions favorable for fog formation. Air pressure steadily declined, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring continued unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable decrease during the early morning hours, and wind direction shifted from west-southwest to more variable, possibly influenced by local topography and atmospheric instability. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer and the potential for foggy, cool mornings with clearing skies later in the day.
