Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the arrival of a cooler air mass. Humidity levels rose sharply in the same period, reaching near saturation, which indicates increasing moisture content and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that often correlates with storm development. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and shifted toward the southwest, aligning with the typical inflow of moist, unstable air ahead of a frontal system. These combined factors point to a heightened risk of thunderstorms, particularly during the overnight hours, with possible impacts including heavy rainfall and localized flooding.
