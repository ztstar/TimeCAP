Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply during midday, suggesting the influence of coastal fog dissipation and onshore breezes. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, which may indicate the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest, likely driven by pressure gradients, before subsiding and shifting direction toward the northwest in the late evening. These conditions collectively point to a transition period in the coastal atmosphere, with potential for fog formation overnight and changing conditions in the coming hours.
