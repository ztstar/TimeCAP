Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours, dropping sharply during the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moisture-laden air and possible clearing skies. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which may signal the passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts likely contributing to enhanced mixing and dispersion of air pollutants. These conditions together suggest a transition from a stable, humid nighttime environment to a more dynamic and potentially unstable daytime regime, which could increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
