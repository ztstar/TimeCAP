Temperatures dropped significantly during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cooling. Humidity levels spiked to saturation during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures climbed and humidity declined. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a sustained rise, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified through the late morning and early afternoon, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in atmospheric flow, possibly associated with a frontal boundary. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and potentially foggy night to a progressively drier and windier day, with improving conditions ahead.
