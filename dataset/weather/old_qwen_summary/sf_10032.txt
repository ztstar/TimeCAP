Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increased moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence and fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a sharp rebound, hinting at the passage of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary, that brought temporary instability. Wind speeds remained minimal except for a brief but strong surge from the south, coinciding with the pressure shift, which may have contributed to mixing the marine layer. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a stable, fog-prone night to a more variable daytime pattern, with potential for clearing skies as pressure stabilizes.
