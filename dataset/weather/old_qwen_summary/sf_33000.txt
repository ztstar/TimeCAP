Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of low-lying fog common in coastal areas. A strong pressure increase in the early hours was followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, indicating a passing weather system that may have brought shifting conditions. Wind patterns shifted from easterly to southerly in the late afternoon, aligning with the arrival of a marine layer surge, while wind speeds intensified, particularly in the late evening. These dynamics suggest a transition from stable, fog-prone conditions to more variable, potentially breezy weather as the system moves through the region.
