Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong cooling trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for condensation or fog formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to the temperature decline and wind changes. Wind speeds intensified in the early afternoon, followed by a sharp decrease overnight, with wind direction shifting from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, indicating a complex local circulation pattern possibly linked to a passing front. The combination of falling temperatures, high humidity, and pressure changes points to a transition period, with possible implications for overnight fog and a slight chance of isolated showers if moisture continues to converge.
