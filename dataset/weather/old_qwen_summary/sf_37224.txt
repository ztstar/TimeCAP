Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by marine air intrusion. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with near-saturation conditions during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which may have contributed to the cooling trend. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the night, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, pointing to the possible passage of a weather front, potentially bringing changing conditions. Wind patterns shifted from consistent offshore flow to more variable and onshore winds later in the day, which may have introduced warmer, drier air and helped disperse fog. These dynamics collectively suggest a transition period with high potential for variable conditions, including the possibility of clearing skies later in the day, but also lingering fog and cooler temperatures in coastal areas.
