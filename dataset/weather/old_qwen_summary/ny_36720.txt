Temperatures dropped significantly during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern likely driven by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night, peaking during early morning hours, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour period, suggesting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the morning and late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests the weather is transitioning toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
