Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the early part of the day before declining significantly in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong westerly and southerly winds in the morning giving way to calm and variable conditions overnight, followed by a resurgence of stronger winds with a northerly component in the evening. These combined factors suggest the passage of a coastal front, likely bringing cooler, moister air and the potential for overcast skies or light precipitation in the coming hours.
