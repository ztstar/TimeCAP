A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a sharp cooling event possibly linked to a passing front or nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity remained consistently high throughout most of the period, suggesting saturated air conditions that could contribute to fog or drizzle, particularly during the cooler overnight hours. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike mid-cycle, followed by a sustained decline, which may signal the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with a transition from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, accompanied by a temporary surge in wind speed, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined factors suggest the influence of a strong weather front, potentially bringing storms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
