Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling phase overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to cooling and potential fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a recovery and stabilization, which may signal the passage of a weak front or changing weather system. Wind speeds increased moderately during the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly from a southerly to easterly flow. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the weather, with possible overcast conditions and a slight chance of light precipitation in the evening.
