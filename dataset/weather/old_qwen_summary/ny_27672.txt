Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily decreasing through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the early and overnight hours, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the evening, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase, peaking in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, including southerly and westerly flows, which may have contributed to the mixing and dispersal of moisture. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more stable regime, likely resulting in improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
