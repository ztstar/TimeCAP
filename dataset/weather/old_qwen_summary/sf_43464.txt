Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming again. Humidity levels spiked to saturation during the same period, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, particularly in the early hours, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained stable with a gradual increase, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then back to the west, consistent with coastal influences and possible sea breeze dynamics. These patterns together suggest a typical marine layer event, with fog and cool temperatures prevailing overnight, now giving way to improving conditions as the day progresses.
