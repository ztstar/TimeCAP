Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant low-pressure system passage, which implies generally fair conditions without storm development. Wind speeds were moderate, with a consistent shift in direction from southerly to westerly during the night and early morning, followed by a return to more variable patterns later in the day, possibly indicating shifting boundary layer dynamics. The combination of high nighttime humidity, stable pressure, and weak winds suggests a potential for fog formation in the early morning, with clearing conditions developing as temperatures rose and winds increased later in the day.
