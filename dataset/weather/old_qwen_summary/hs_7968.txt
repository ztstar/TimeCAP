Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, indicating a transition from a stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a peak in mid-afternoon before a sustained drop, suggesting the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief lull during the early morning and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, which may signal a change in airflow patterns. These dynamics point to a developing atmospheric instability, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
