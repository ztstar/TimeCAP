Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure consistently increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest during the morning, consistent with changing flow patterns under the influence of the high-pressure ridge. These combined trends point to a transition toward drier, clearer conditions, with reduced cloud cover and improved visibility expected in the coming hours.
