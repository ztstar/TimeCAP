Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation overnight, which likely contributed to a muggy feel during the night. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the morning, stabilizing during midday before a gradual decline in the late afternoon, reflecting a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from northeast to east-southeast in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. The combination of rising humidity, shifting wind patterns, and a declining pressure trend may indicate the potential for increased cloud cover or scattered showers later in the day.
