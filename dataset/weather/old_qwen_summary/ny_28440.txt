Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a gradual rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a more stable high-pressure regime. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the northwest and west, suggesting a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, cool, and unstable air mass to a drier and more stable environment, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
