Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, indicating increased moisture in the air, which likely contributed to a more oppressive feel during those hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline, suggesting the approach of a changing weather system. Wind patterns shifted notably from southerly to westerly directions, with a strengthening of wind speed in the final hours, hinting at the arrival of a frontal boundary or storm system. These combined signals suggest that the city may be transitioning into a period of potentially unsettled weather, with increased chances of precipitation and fluctuating temperatures.
