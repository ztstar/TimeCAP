Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of incoming heat. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase throughout the day, reflecting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southwest, indicative of a developing circulation pattern likely associated with a frontal boundary. Collectively, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a warmer, drier, and more stable afternoon condition, with potential for clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
