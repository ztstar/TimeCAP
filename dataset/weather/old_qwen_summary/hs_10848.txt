Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a nighttime cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, peaking in the early morning and late night, then dropping sharply during midday, suggesting possible drying due to increased solar heating. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that may signal unsettled weather conditions approaching. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted notably in the late afternoon, indicating a change in airflow patterns, possibly linked to a developing weather front. These combined trends suggest the potential for changing weather conditions, including possible showers or thunderstorms, particularly as the low-pressure system continues to influence the region.
