Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels steadily increased overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface. A drop in air pressure during the midday hours, followed by a recovery, points to the passage of a transient weather system, possibly associated with shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and then toward the west-southwest, consistent with a sea breeze or frontal passage. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and changing wind flow suggests a transition from a cool, foggy coastal regime to a warmer, clearer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the summer months.
