Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking overnight before plummeting dramatically in the midday, suggesting a possible frontal passage or dry air intrusion. A notable spike in air pressure during midday, followed by a gradual decline, points to the influence of a high-pressure system that passed through, likely bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from northwesterly to more southerly over time, with speeds remaining light to moderate, possibly contributing to the mixing of air masses and the dispersion of moisture. Overall, the data indicates a dynamic weather transition, with potential for improving conditions later in the day, though lingering humidity and shifting winds may affect comfort levels.
