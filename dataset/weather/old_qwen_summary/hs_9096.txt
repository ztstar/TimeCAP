Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before showing slight recovery toward midday. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the overnight hours, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A significant pressure increase occurred in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a strong high-pressure system, which brought stable and dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained low except during late night and early morning hours, when gusts intensified from the northwest and northeast, possibly signaling shifting air masses. The combination of high humidity, falling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a developing atmospheric stability that could suppress convective activity, reducing the chance of thunderstorms in the immediate forecast window.
