Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure decreased notably during the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought overcast and damp conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase in the early morning followed by a calm period, while wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly, consistent with marine air intrusion. These conditions point to the influence of a coastal fog event driven by marine layer dynamics, which is typical for San Francisco’s microclimate and likely responsible for the prolonged cool, damp weather.
