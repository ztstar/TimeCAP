Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during the coolest part of the day. A gradual increase in air pressure throughout the day, particularly during midday, reflects the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, contributing to stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more variable and predominantly westerly, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. Combined with decreasing humidity and rising temperatures in the latter part of the day, these trends suggest improving conditions with a reduced chance of precipitation and a transition toward a drier, more stable atmospheric regime.
