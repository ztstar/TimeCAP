Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from dry to more moist conditions. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of low-pressure systems that could bring storms. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late afternoon, with a notable lull during the overnight hours, and wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing local airflow patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal fog pattern, likely driven by marine layer dynamics, which may have contributed to the cooling trend and high humidity.
