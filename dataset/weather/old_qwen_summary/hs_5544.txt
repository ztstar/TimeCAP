Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong daytime heating trend. Humidity levels peaked sharply during early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A significant pressure drop occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changes in conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction suggesting a change in air mass, possibly linked to a frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with elevated chances of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
