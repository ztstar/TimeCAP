Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the mid-afternoon before steadily declining into the night, indicating a transition from daytime heating to nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early evening, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure exhibited a slight decline through the night, followed by a recovery in the morning, consistent with a passing weather front or low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased steadily after midday, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast in the late afternoon and evening, which may have contributed to mixing moist air and enhancing overnight cooling. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly aligns with a change in synoptic flow, possibly signaling the approach of a moist, unstable air mass that could lead to increased thunderstorm potential in the coming hours.
