Influenza activity has shown a sharp and sustained increase over the past 20 weeks, with positivity rates rising from low baseline levels to a peak that reflects intense community transmission. The proportion of Influenza A detections has consistently outpaced Influenza B, indicating its dominant role in driving the current season’s epidemic. The exponential growth in positivity ratios, particularly in the last 6–8 weeks, suggests accelerating spread, likely influenced by increased testing volume and heightened viral circulation. A notable divergence in trend between the two strains is evident, with Influenza A exhibiting a steeper growth curve compared to Influenza B, which may influence public health response and vaccine effectiveness assessments. The current trajectory signals a high-risk period for vulnerable populations, warranting urgent emphasis on preventive measures, clinical preparedness, and resource allocation.
