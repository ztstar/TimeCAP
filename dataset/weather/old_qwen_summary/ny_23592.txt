Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels were consistently high during the overnight and early morning hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon and continuing to decrease into the evening, suggesting a drying trend. Air pressure increased steadily through the morning and early afternoon before beginning a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a changing weather system. Wind speeds remained low and calm through the night and early morning, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating a dynamic atmospheric adjustment. These combined trends suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight period to a more variable, drying, and potentially unsettled afternoon-to-evening pattern, possibly setting the stage for changing conditions in the coming hours.
