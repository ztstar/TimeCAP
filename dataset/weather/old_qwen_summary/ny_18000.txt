Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially during the night and early morning, which contributed to foggy conditions and a damp feel. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that likely enhanced storm development and increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong gusts from the northeast, suggesting the approach of a frontal system. The consistent wind direction from the northeast and the drop in pressure point to an active weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially disruptive conditions in the near term.
