Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained elevated through the night and early morning, then declined sharply in the late morning, signaling the possible approach of a weather system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate and consistent in the early hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then back to southerly, reflecting changing atmospheric flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates an increased likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day.
