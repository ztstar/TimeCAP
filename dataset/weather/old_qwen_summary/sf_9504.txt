Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating a saturated atmosphere that likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend, especially in the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring continued unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases in the late evening, and wind direction shifted significantly from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting changing circulation patterns near the coast. These indicators collectively point to a marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for persistent fog and cool, damp conditions in the coming hours.
