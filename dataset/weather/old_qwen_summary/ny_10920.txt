Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout most of the period, with a notable spike in the late night hours, indicating potential moisture buildup in the atmosphere. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a sharp rise, suggesting the passage of a weather front, likely associated with a storm system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, particularly from the southeast and southwest, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. These combined indicators point to dynamic atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and changing weather patterns in the coming hours.
