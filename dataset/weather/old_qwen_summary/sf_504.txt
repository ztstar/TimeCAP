Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the morning and afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, potentially bringing in maritime air and influencing local cloud formation. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly patterns hints at changing synoptic influences, possibly linked to coastal dynamics and the development of a sea breeze or frontal passage.
