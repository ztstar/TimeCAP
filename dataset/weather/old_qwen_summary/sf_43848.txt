Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon and dropping significantly overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which coincided with the lowest temperatures and suggests the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight drop in the early morning hours followed by a gradual increase, signaling a stable atmospheric regime with minimal storm activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, particularly from a southerly to westerly direction, which may have contributed to the transport of moist marine air inland. The shift in wind direction from the southwest and south toward the west and northwest late in the cycle indicates a possible change in synoptic flow, which could signal the beginning of a transition toward clearer skies and calmer conditions.
