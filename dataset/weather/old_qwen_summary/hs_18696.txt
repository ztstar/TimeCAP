Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, suggesting nocturnal condensation or moisture accumulation, which then declined during the day as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. Together, these indicators suggest the onset of a developing weather disturbance, potentially leading to increased chances of precipitation and storm activity in the near term.
