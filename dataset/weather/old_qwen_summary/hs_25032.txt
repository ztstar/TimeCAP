Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a nocturnal boundary layer change. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and morning, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low initially but intensified significantly in the final hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, signaling a possible change in airflow patterns. This combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and shifting direction may indicate the approach of a frontal boundary, potentially leading to changing weather conditions in the coming hours.
