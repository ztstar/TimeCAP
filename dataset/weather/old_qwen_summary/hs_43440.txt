Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, creating a damp and muggy atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, suggesting a change in air mass or the approach of a boundary. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal regime to a drier, more variable daytime atmosphere, with potential for clearing skies and improving visibility later in the day.
