Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night, dropping sharply in the mid-morning before rebounding in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in moisture content. Air pressure rose steadily through the early hours, peaking in the midday, then declined sharply in the evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the midday, with strong southerly and westerly flows, potentially signaling the influence of a coastal breeze or frontal passage. The combination of rising temperatures, variable wind patterns, and fluctuating pressure and humidity suggests the onset of a dynamic weather transition, possibly bringing changing conditions overnight.
