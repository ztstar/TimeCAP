Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of late autumn. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking mid-morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a period of air mass adjustment and potential for clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then began a gradual decline, signaling the approach of a developing weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. Combined with the pressure trend and directional shift, these observations suggest the arrival of a storm system that may bring precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
