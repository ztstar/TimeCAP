Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, peaking at saturation just before dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and poor visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late evening and early morning, with strong, shifting winds from the northwest and northeast, suggesting atmospheric instability and possible storm development. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and strong winds hints at the potential for thunderstorms later in the day, especially as daytime heating resumes.
