Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, reaching their lowest point in the early hours before beginning to rise slightly, indicating dry air conditions during the night. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds surged during the early morning hours, originating from the northwest and shifting to more easterly and southerly directions by midday, likely due to local topographic influences and pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and a shift in wind direction points to improving conditions with reduced chances of fog or precipitation, supporting a sunny and mild forecast for the coming hours.
