Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, but a notable drop occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak weather front or shift in local circulation. Wind activity was subdued overnight, with calm conditions and variable wind directions, but strengthened in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by a sea breeze or pressure gradient changes. These patterns together suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable afternoon regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
