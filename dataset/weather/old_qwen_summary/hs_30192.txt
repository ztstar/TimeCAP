Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of high humidity, peaking at saturation levels during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to a strong dew point and a muggy feel. Temperature trends showed a steady cooling during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a notable afternoon rebound. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding significantly in the late afternoon, signaling the possible passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift in direction from southerly to more southeasterly, suggesting the influence of a developing or passing front. The combination of rising wind speeds, a pressure rise, and a drop in humidity from the late afternoon onward implies that a drier, more stable air mass may be moving in, potentially bringing relief from the earlier oppressive conditions.
