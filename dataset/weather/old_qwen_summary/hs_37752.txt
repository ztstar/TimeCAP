Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before stabilizing in the mid-range during the day. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase overnight, peaking during the early morning, which suggests the presence of moist air masses and possible dew point saturation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a strong shift toward the northwest and west-southwest directions, likely driven by an approaching frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable air, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but potentially increasing the risk of localized fog during early morning hours due to high humidity and cooling.
