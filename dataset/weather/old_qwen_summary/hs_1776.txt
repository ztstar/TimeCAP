Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures gradually rising through the day, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for afternoon heat buildup. Humidity levels climbed significantly in the late afternoon and evening, reaching near saturation, which enhances the perceived heat and elevates discomfort levels. A consistent decline in air pressure throughout the day suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unstable conditions and the potential for thunderstorms later in the period. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a southeasterly to easterly direction, signaling possible inflow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors—rising temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds—point to a high likelihood of developing thunderstorm activity, especially during the evening and overnight hours.
