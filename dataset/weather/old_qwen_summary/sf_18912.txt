Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, reaching and maintaining saturation for much of the period, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low clouds. Temperature remained relatively stable with a gradual decline, suggesting a persistent cool maritime influence, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily decreased, particularly in the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring more unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the early to midday hours before tapering off, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a prolonged period of foggy, cool, and potentially damp weather, consistent with the typical marine layer pattern in San Francisco.
