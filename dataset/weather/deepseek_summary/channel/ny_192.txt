- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a steady increase throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-to-late afternoon before experiencing a dramatic and unexplained drop during the final hour. The sharp decline from near saturation to significantly lower levels suggests a sudden change in atmospheric conditions, possibly due to a shift in air mass or a localized weather event. This volatility indicates unstable air conditions, which could signal the potential for rapidly changing weather, including the onset of precipitation or temperature fluctuations.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has shown a sustained downward trend over the past 24 hours, indicating the possible approach of a low-pressure system. A notable acceleration in the decline occurred in the final hours, culminating in a sharp drop to a significantly lower value, which may signal deteriorating weather conditions. This pattern suggests increasing instability in the atmosphere, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy weather in the near term.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline during the initial phase, followed by a pronounced and sustained increase, culminating in a peak near the end of the 24-hour period. A notable anomaly occurred mid-cycle with a brief dip before the upward trend resumed, suggesting possible transient atmospheric or measurement fluctuations. The overall pattern indicates a significant warming trend in the latter half, which may reflect diurnal heating or changing weather conditions impacting the region.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a stable baseline during the initial period, followed by a sustained increase to elevated levels, suggesting the onset of stronger wind conditions. A notable anomaly occurred with a complete cessation of wind, followed by a sharp rebound to high values, indicating a possible localized disturbance or shift in atmospheric flow. The fluctuating pattern, particularly the repeated spikes and lulls, implies dynamic and unstable wind behavior that could impact outdoor activities, air quality dispersion, and localized weather impacts.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Over the past 24 hours, wind direction exhibited a prolonged period of consistent northeasterly flow, indicating stable air mass conditions. A significant shift occurred in the late afternoon, with winds rapidly transitioning to a southerly to westerly quadrant, suggesting the influence of a developing or passing weather system. This abrupt change, particularly the sharp transition to a southerly direction followed by a return toward the east, may signal the approach of a frontal boundary or changing pressure gradient, warranting attention for potential weather changes.
