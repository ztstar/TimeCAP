Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of cool temperatures, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through midday, followed by a significant and sudden drop, which may indicate the passage of a weather front or storm system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift to more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late afternoon, coinciding with a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly sectors. These indicators together point to a dynamic atmospheric shift, likely driven by an approaching low-pressure system, which could bring increased cloud cover, precipitation, or fog later in the day.
