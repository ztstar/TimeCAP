Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating a transition from stable nocturnal conditions to a drier, more stable daytime atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight drop in the late evening, suggesting possible atmospheric instability approaching. Wind speeds were consistently low and wind direction remained nearly constant, indicating weak synoptic forcing and minimal air mixing, which may contribute to localized fog or poor dispersion of pollutants overnight. The overall pattern suggests a clear, calm night followed by a warming, drying trend, potentially setting the stage for afternoon heating and possible convective development later in the day.
