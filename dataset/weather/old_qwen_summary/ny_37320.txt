Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to milder daytime temperatures. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely linked to changing air mass characteristics. Air pressure steadily decreased through the early and mid-day, reaching a low point before gradually rising again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with stormy conditions and frontal passage. Overall, the data reflects the influence of a passing weather front, resulting in a mix of precipitation risk overnight, followed by clearing skies and a potential for gusty winds as high pressure begins to reassert control.
