Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the early and mid-day, then began to decline sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing of fog or moisture. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend in the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased progressively through the day, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest that fog and cool conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate are beginning to dissipate, potentially leading to clearer skies and milder temperatures in the coming hours.
