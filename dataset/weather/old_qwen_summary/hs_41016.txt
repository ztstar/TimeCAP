Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, before declining sharply during the afternoon due to increasing temperatures and mixing. Air pressure showed a gradual rise throughout the day, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more variable directions, hinting at developing local circulations or frontal influences. The combination of warming temperatures, dropping humidity, and increasing wind suggests improving conditions, with potential for clearing skies and reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
