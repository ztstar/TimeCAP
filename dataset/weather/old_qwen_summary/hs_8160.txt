Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warming day. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for condensation or fog formation. A notable shift in air pressure occurred mid-morning, with a sharp decline, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the increased humidity and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low until late afternoon, when they began to increase, coinciding with a change in wind direction that shifted from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating the arrival of a new air mass. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic weather shift, with high moisture and recent pressure changes increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day.
