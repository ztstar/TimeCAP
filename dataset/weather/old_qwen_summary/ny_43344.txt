Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the midday and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, consistent with changing pressure gradients. Together, these indicators suggest the arrival of a dynamic weather system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near future.
