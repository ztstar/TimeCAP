Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before rapidly declining, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearing skies and reduced wind. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east and then slightly southward in the late afternoon, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a stable, drying trend following a cool, humid night, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and promoting clearer skies in the near term.
