Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night before stabilizing in the early morning, indicating a cooling trend likely associated with clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose significantly in the evening and remained elevated overnight, peaking just before dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, reaching a peak mid-morning before beginning a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weakening high-pressure system or the influence of a developing low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning and late evening, particularly from the east and southeast, suggesting changing wind patterns possibly linked to a frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, combined with rising humidity and falling pressure, indicates an evolving weather pattern that could bring cloudier conditions or precipitation later in the day.
