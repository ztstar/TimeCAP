Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating the onset of diurnal heating. Humidity remained elevated through the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with increasing solar insolation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during mid-morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight before increasing in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may reflect the influence of a developing sea breeze or synoptic-scale flow. Together, these indicators suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight pattern to a drier, warmer, and more stable daytime regime, typical of a developing high-pressure ridge over the region.
