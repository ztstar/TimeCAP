Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, peaking at near saturation during the night and morning, then plummeting to very dry conditions in the midday, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to a drier, clearer atmosphere. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp decline in the early hours followed by stabilization, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought in moist air and associated precipitation. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong northerly and westerly flows early in the night giving way to lighter, more variable winds later, consistent with changing pressure gradients and possible sea breeze influences. These combined dynamics point to a highly dynamic weather transition, likely involving fog dissipation, a clearing trend, and an emerging pattern of warmer, drier conditions in the coming hours.
