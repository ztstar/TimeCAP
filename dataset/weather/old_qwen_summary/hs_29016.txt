Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which contributed to a damp and muggy atmosphere, likely increasing discomfort for residents. Air pressure showed a marked decline during the same period, reaching a low point in the early hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, suggesting the arrival of warmer, moist air from the Gulf. These combined factors point to the potential for thunderstorms or heavy showers developing later in the day, especially given the high humidity and dynamic wind patterns.
