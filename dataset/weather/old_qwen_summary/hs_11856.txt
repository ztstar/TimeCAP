Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and late night hours, with a sharp decline during midday, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible dry air intrusion. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable calm period during the early afternoon, followed by a resurgence in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly, which may indicate changing synoptic conditions. Together, these indicators suggest a developing weather pattern conducive to possible thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
