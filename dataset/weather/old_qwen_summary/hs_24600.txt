Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in multiple instances, particularly during the pre-dawn hours, indicating strong moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the mid-morning and afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low through the night but picked up in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and increasing wind activity suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, especially if moisture continues to be advected into the region.
