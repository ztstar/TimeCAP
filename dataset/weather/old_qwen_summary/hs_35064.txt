Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the morning before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible clearing conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced humidity. Wind speeds increased slightly in the afternoon and maintained a consistent direction from the northeast to east, aligning with typical daytime sea breeze patterns or a developing synoptic-scale flow. These combined changes point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, which may reduce the risk of thunderstorms and support clearer skies for the coming hours.
