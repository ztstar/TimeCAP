Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more moderate afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved conditions. Wind patterns showed alternating periods of calm and light-to-moderate breezes, with a notable shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast and then to the south-southeast, indicating changing flow dynamics near the coast. These trends collectively point to a typical coastal weather cycle, with nighttime cooling, early-morning fog, and daytime clearing, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
