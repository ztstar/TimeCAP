Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the buildup of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late afternoon, with winds shifting from the northwest to the southwest, possibly due to coastal influences and localized pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and variable wind patterns suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely reduction in fog and increased sunshine in the coming hours.
