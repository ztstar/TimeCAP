Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity, remaining near saturation for the majority of the period, which contributed to a pronounced cool and damp feel. Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a slow recovery into the late afternoon. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating a developing low-pressure system approaching the region, which may signal unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more southeasterly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a likely continuation of overcast, foggy conditions with a potential for light precipitation, particularly if the low-pressure system intensifies.
