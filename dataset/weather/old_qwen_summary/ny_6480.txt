Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar heating and possibly a developing high-pressure system. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining high into midday before sharply declining, suggesting a drying trend likely tied to a shift in air mass and reduced moisture content. Air pressure showed a sustained decline in the early to mid-morning hours, followed by stabilization around a slightly low but stable baseline, which may signal the passage of a weather front or the influence of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during much of the day, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly and then southerly, indicating a change in circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a cooler, moist, and stable morning to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic afternoon and evening, potentially setting the stage for unsettled weather later in the day.
