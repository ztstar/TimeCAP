Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining high throughout the day, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture, typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the early morning, stabilizing later, which may point to an approaching weather system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased steadily through the morning, reaching a peak in the midday hours before tapering off in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then northwest, indicating changing atmospheric flow. These combined conditions suggest a persistent marine layer with fog and cool, damp conditions, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly during the transition from night to day.
