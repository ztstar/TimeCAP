Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, remaining elevated through mid-morning, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent rise during the afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from southerly to northerly and easterly directions, likely driven by changing pressure gradients and possibly associated with a frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a potentially clearer and drier daytime, with minimal precipitation risk but lingering moisture that could fuel afternoon thunderstorms if heating intensifies.
