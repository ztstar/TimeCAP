Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels increased significantly in the latter half of the period, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests the potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily declined, reflecting an approaching low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and overnight hours, with stronger gusts originating from the southeast and shifting to the northeast, consistent with storm development. These combined factors point to a developing weather event, likely bringing precipitation and potentially gusty conditions in the near term.
