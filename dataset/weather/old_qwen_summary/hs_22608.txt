Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, indicating a shift from a more stable nighttime air mass to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the night, reaching a peak mid-morning before beginning to decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for changing conditions. Wind speeds remained low until late evening, when they intensified and shifted toward a more southerly direction, which may signal the approach of a new air mass. The overall pattern suggests a transition from cool, humid conditions to a drier, warming trend, with possible implications for thunderstorm development in the coming hours.
