Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. A significant increase in humidity occurred overnight, peaking at saturation levels, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure rose sharply in the early morning, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds intensified during the overnight hours, particularly from the northwest, before subsiding significantly in the mid-morning and remaining light through most of the day. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and then back to the northwest suggests a complex interaction of coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale flow, influencing both temperature and moisture patterns.
