Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend, with temperatures decreasing significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, then dropped dramatically during the midday, indicating a drying trend possibly linked to a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining slightly in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, which may indicate the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the potential for changing conditions including possible precipitation or thunderstorms later in the day.
