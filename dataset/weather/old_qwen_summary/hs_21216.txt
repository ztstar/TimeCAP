Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which significantly increases the perception of mugginess and suggests a high likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily rose, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions, though recent fluctuations may indicate dynamic atmospheric changes. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast during the early morning, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Taken together, these conditions point to a transition phase where cooling, high humidity, and shifting winds may have contributed to overnight fog or the potential for isolated thunderstorms.
