Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog or mist, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has brought stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low in the early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from southerly to westerly directions, consistent with the onset of a more dynamic coastal pattern. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and rising pressure points to a transition from a foggy, damp morning to a drier, clearer afternoon and evening, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate variability.
