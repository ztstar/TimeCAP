Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improved visibility. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that may have brought in drier air. These patterns suggest a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a warmer, clearer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate dynamics.
