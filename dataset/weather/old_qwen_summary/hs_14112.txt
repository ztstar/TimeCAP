Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, reaching saturation multiple times, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation and increasing the potential for oppressive conditions during warmer periods. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the evening and overnight, peaking in the early morning before a sharp decline, which may signal the approach of a developing low-pressure system and potential storm activity. Wind speeds were generally low during the early morning, with a brief period of calm, but increased notably in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass influences. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather pattern, possibly leading to unstable conditions and a higher chance of thunderstorms later in the day.
