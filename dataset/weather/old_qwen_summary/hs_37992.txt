Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose sharply during the evening and overnight hours, reaching saturation and sustaining near-100% for several hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery in the afternoon—suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or developing instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward southerly and southeasterly directions, consistent with moist onshore flow that can fuel convective activity. Combined with high moisture and weakening pressure, these conditions indicate a heightened potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
