A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the influence of overnight cooling and potential moisture accumulation. Air pressure remained generally stable through the night but began to decline in the late afternoon, which may signal approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing airflow patterns that could precede a weather system shift. Combined, these trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for developing conditions favorable to afternoon thunderstorms.
