Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then sharply declined during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely linked to changing wind patterns. Air pressure showed a steady rise, culminating in a pronounced spike in the late morning, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system and stable weather conditions. Wind direction shifted progressively from southeasterly to northerly and then to a more easterly flow, with sustained wind speeds that increased slightly in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a change in regional airflow dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, consistent with the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region.
