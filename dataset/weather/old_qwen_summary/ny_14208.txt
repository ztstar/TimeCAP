Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity remained near saturation during the early hours, sharply dropping in the midday period, suggesting the passage of a front that brought drier air. Air pressure steadily increased through the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, with a brief surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, cool, and stable nighttime pattern to a drier, warming daytime regime, likely resulting in improving visibility and a break from earlier overcast or damp conditions.
