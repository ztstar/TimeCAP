Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a subtle rebound in the late afternoon, indicating a cooling trend that began overnight. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night and into the early morning, peaking in the early hours, which suggests increasing moisture content in the atmosphere and a potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period before showing a slight upward trend in the late evening, signaling the possible approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, indicating a change in air mass and possible storm development. The combination of rising humidity, stable-to-increasing pressure, and shifting winds suggests a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to precipitation or a change in temperature trends in the coming hours.
