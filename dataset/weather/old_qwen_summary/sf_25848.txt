Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours, indicating dense fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and reduced visibility. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, suggesting no major storm systems are influencing the region at this time. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, consistent southerly to westerly breezes developing, likely enhancing the cooling effect and dispersing fog layers. The shift in wind direction from coastal to more easterly and southerly patterns may signal the onset of a marine layer influence, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns during transitional periods.
