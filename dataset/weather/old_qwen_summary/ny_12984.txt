Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, suggesting a clear night with radiative cooling followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply decreasing, which may signal the presence of a nocturnal inversion and subsequent drying as the sun rose. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early night, then decreased through the morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly and then easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure system. Overall, the data points to a transition from cool, dry, and stable conditions at night to increasingly warmer and drier conditions during the day, with minimal risk of precipitation or significant weather disruptions.
