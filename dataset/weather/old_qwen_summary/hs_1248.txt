Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. The air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before showing a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting the influence of a developing surface circulation. These conditions collectively point to a transition period that could favor the development of isolated showers or thunderstorms as the warm, moist air continues to interact with the changing wind patterns.
