Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the influence of an approaching low-pressure system. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a slow recovery in the afternoon, consistent with a nocturnal temperature inversion and increasing solar heating. Humidity remained persistently high, particularly during the early morning and late evening hours, signaling saturated atmospheric conditions conducive to fog or dew formation. Wind patterns shifted from variable directions in the early hours to more southerly and westerly flows later in the day, suggesting the onset of a more organized airflow associated with the low-pressure system. Given the combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and increasing wind speeds, there is a heightened likelihood of scattered thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, especially during the late afternoon and evening.
