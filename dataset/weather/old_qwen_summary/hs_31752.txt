Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in multiple periods, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low stratus clouds, reducing visibility and creating a damp, muggy feel. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with shifts in direction indicating changing air masses, particularly a notable shift from easterly to westerly flow later in the day. These conditions suggest a transition toward drier and more stable weather, though lingering moisture may support isolated thunderstorm development if instability increases.
