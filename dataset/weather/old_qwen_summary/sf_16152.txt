Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer, drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong weather systems passing through, though slight drops were observed during periods of increased wind activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting directions from the northeast to the southwest, hinting at changing atmospheric flow patterns possibly linked to coastal influences. These conditions point to a typical San Francisco microclimate pattern: cool, foggy mornings giving way to warmer, drier afternoons, with winds playing a key role in modulating temperature and moisture transport.
