Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal cycles and changing air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, peaking in the early morning and reaching its lowest point in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring instability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with sustained southerly and easterly winds, which may have transported moisture inland and contributed to the development of convective activity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to northerly toward the end of the period suggests a possible change in synoptic-scale flow, potentially indicating an approaching front or storm system.
