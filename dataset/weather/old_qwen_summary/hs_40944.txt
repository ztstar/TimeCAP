Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning hours. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the late night and early morning, indicating the presence of moist air and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight dip in the early morning hours, suggesting a weakening of high-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, starting from southerly directions and transitioning to more easterly and northeasterly flows by morning, which may signal an approaching weather change. The combination of high humidity, falling temperatures, and shifting wind direction points to a possible increase in cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
