Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend during the day, with temperatures peaking in the afternoon before cooling slightly overnight. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more southerly, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These indicators collectively suggest the end of a foggy, cool period and the onset of drier, more stable weather, typical of late summer transitions in the region.
