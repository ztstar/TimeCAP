Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog dynamics. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation, which is consistent with the formation of dense marine fog commonly observed in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that helped maintain calm and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the early morning, then increased again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southwesterly to more southerly, reflecting changes in local coastal flow. These patterns point to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to cool, foggy conditions in the mornings and clearer, milder afternoons.
