Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss and changing air mass dynamics. Humidity remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during the night and early morning. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before gradually declining, which is consistent with the passage of a high-pressure system and improving conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with strong gusts in the mid-afternoon and early evening, followed by a marked decrease during the night, indicating a shift in local wind patterns possibly tied to boundary layer stability. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to more variable and then northerly, suggesting a change in airflow, possibly due to a frontal influence or sea breeze reversal, which could signal evolving synoptic conditions.
