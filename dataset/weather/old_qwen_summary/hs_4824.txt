Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, spiked dramatically in the early morning, and then gradually declined, suggesting possible nocturnal condensation or fog formation followed by evaporative drying. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, with a notable drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather dynamics. Wind speeds increased substantially in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, aligning with a shift in wind direction that could indicate the influence of a developing circulation pattern. These combined trends suggest the potential for unstable air and possible convective activity later in the day, warranting attention for thunderstorm development.
