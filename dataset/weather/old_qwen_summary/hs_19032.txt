Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a shift in air mass. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, indicating a change in synoptic flow. These combined patterns suggest a developing boundary layer instability, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
