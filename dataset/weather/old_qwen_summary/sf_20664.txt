Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly after midnight, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, weakening winds, and potentially increasing chances of precipitation later in the day.
