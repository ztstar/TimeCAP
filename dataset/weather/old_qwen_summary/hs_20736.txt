Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating increasing moisture content in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight drop toward the end, suggesting a possible weakening of high-pressure control and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low and variable, with a shift from light northeasterly winds to stronger southerly and southeasterly flows later in the day, consistent with a developing onshore flow. The combination of rising humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to increasing atmospheric instability, which could lead to afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the coming hours.
