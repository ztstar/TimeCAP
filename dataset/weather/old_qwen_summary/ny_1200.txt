Temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity remained elevated through the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which may have contributed to foggy or damp conditions. Air pressure continued to decrease steadily overnight, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the northeast, signaling a shift in atmospheric circulation that could bring cooler air and potential precipitation. Combined, these trends point to an active weather system moving through the region, likely bringing unsettled conditions, including possible showers, in the near term.
