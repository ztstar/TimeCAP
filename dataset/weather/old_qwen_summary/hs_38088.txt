Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of near-saturation, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting a high potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south, which may indicate the influence of a developing frontal system. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development or heavy rainfall in the near term, with potential impacts on travel and outdoor activities.
