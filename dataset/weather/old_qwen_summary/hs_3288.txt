Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the encroachment of a high-pressure system that has stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm or light winds, but strengthened in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to changes in pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly sectors points to a change in air mass flow, potentially signaling a transition toward drier and more stable conditions.
