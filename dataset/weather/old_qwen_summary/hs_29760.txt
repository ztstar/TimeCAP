Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a shift from cooler nocturnal conditions to stronger daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early night, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before plummeting during midday, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the afternoon, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were moderate in the early hours, decreased significantly during the night, then increased again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northwest to more southerly and easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends suggest the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially leading to clear skies and elevated temperatures in the coming hours, though early morning fog or low clouds may have persisted due to high humidity overnight.
