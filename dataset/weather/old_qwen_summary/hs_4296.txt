Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning, persisting at high levels through midday, which contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with calm conditions prevailing around dawn, before increasing again in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing winds suggests a developing storm system, indicating a potential for thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
