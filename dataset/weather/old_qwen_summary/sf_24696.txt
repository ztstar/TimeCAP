Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature cycle, beginning with a gradual cooling through the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming trend during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a sharp contrast, with high values during the early morning hours giving way to a dramatic drop in midday, likely due to clearing skies and increased solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a notable dip during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a weakening of a high-pressure system or the approach of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation that may be associated with a coastal breeze or frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, warmer regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
