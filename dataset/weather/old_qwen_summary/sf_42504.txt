Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal moderation. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, a common occurrence in the region during marine layer events. Air pressure remained nearly stable throughout the period, with a brief dip during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of a weak, slow-moving low-pressure influence or a shift in boundary layer dynamics. Wind patterns showed a strong shift in direction from northwesterly to southerly in the late morning and afternoon, accompanied by a reduction in wind speed, which may have allowed the marine layer to stagnate and intensify fog conditions. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind flow points to a persistent marine layer that could lead to continued overcast skies and cool, damp conditions into the next 24 hours.
