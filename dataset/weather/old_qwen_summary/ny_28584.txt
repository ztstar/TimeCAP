Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from a cold nighttime period to a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting possible dew formation or fog development followed by clearing skies. Air pressure exhibited a notable decrease in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a developing storm system drawing in moist air. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and weakening pressure suggests the potential for precipitation or unstable weather conditions in the near term.
