Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend began in the early morning hours, followed by a significant drop in temperature during the late night, indicating the arrival of a cooler air mass. Humidity levels steadily increased throughout the night, peaking at saturation, which coincided with the temperature drop and suggests the likelihood of fog or light precipitation. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, reaching a peak before slightly declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low during most of the period, with a brief lull and a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air flow, possibly tied to the transition between weather systems. The combination of rising humidity, falling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to the potential for foggy conditions in the early morning hours and a possible period of light rain or drizzle as the system evolves.
