Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a stable, moist boundary layer to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant high or low-pressure systems passing through, which implies fair weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward southerly and easterly directions, potentially indicating the influence of a developing sea breeze or shallow low-level convergence. Overall, the pattern suggests a warm, humid start to the day with increasing afternoon winds, consistent with typical summer weather in the region, and may indicate a potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
