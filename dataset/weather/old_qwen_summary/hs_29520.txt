Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels peaked overnight and remained elevated, contributing to a muggy atmosphere, which likely intensified the perceived heat. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially associated with storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling a change in airflow that could bring precipitation. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, particularly during the evening hours.
