Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for afternoon heat buildup. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the evening, which suggests a saturated atmosphere conducive to the development of thunderstorms or prolonged muggy conditions. Air pressure showed a steady decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in direction toward the east and southeast, hinting at a possible influx of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Together, these indicators point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day or overnight, with potential for heavy rainfall and localized flooding.
