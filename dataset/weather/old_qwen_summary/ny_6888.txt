Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a damp and muggy feel, particularly during the pre-dawn hours. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with the observed increase in cloud cover and moisture. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and eventually to a strong easterly flow by dawn, indicating changing synoptic conditions and potential for precipitation. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind direction points to an increased likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
