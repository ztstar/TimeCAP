Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, and remained elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, with a notable dip in the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased overnight and remained elevated through the morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, before calming significantly during the late afternoon and early evening. The shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast and eventually to the northeast suggests a change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the approach of a marine layer or a weather front, which may bring overcast skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
