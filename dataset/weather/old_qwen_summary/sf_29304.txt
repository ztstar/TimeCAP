Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight period, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from coastal to more easterly and southerly flows. These changes suggest a transition from marine layer dominance to a more inland-driven circulation pattern, potentially leading to clearer skies and drier conditions in the coming hours.
