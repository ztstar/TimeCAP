Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the day, suggesting the dissipation of moisture as air warmed and mixed. A marked increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady decline through the afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to a more variable pattern, including a brief southerly surge, potentially indicating shifting frontal influences. These combined dynamics suggest a transition period in the weather, possibly leading to increased instability and potential for afternoon thunderstorms as daytime heating continues to energize the atmosphere.
