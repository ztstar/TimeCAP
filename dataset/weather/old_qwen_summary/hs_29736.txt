Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that may have contributed to fog or dew formation, before decreasing substantially during the daytime as temperatures rose. A sustained decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly in the afternoon, signals the passage of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, peaking in the late afternoon and evening with strong, steady winds from the southwest, likely driven by shifting pressure gradients. The consistent wind direction from the southwest during peak wind speeds and the concurrent drop in pressure suggest an approaching frontal system, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
