Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sharp drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling event. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night and early morning, then began to decrease in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system. Wind speeds and directions showed a shift from southerly to more easterly and then northerly flow, with the most consistent winds occurring in the afternoon, likely due to local convection and pressure gradients. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day if instability increases.
