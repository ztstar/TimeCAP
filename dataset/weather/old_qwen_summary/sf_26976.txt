Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the mid-morning and early afternoon, indicating a drying trend, which may have contributed to clearer skies. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning and late evening, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained low during the night and increased during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a transitional weather phase, possibly setting the stage for a more stable and drier period in the coming hours.
