Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City experienced a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, then declined slightly but remained elevated, suggesting a moist air mass was present. Air pressure showed a gradual rise throughout the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, hinting at a change in air flow. The combination of rising pressure, increasing temperature, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more stable and potentially fair weather in the coming hours.
