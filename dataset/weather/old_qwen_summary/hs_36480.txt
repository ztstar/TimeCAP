Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before leveling off in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a sharp drop during the early morning hours, followed by a significant rebound in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in moisture content likely tied to changing air masses. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift to more variable and southerly wind directions, suggesting the onset of a changeable air flow pattern. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass with potential for improved visibility and reduced risk of precipitation, though localized gusts may persist.
