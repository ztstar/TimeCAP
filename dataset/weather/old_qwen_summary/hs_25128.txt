Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels peaked overnight, reaching near-saturation conditions, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn hours, followed by a sharp decline as temperatures rose and air became drier. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-morning, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clearing conditions, though a brief drop later in the day may signal an approaching disturbance. Wind patterns shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from southerly to westerly and then to northerly flow, with sustained higher speeds in the final hours, potentially signaling the onset of a frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition from humid, stable conditions to potentially unsettled weather, increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
