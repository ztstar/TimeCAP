Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours, before dropping significantly during the afternoon. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from southerly to more westerly and southerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially clearing skies and improving air quality later in the day.
