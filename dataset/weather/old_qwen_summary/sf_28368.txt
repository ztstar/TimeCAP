Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, particularly during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the early morning, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system, followed by a steady decline through the night and into the early morning hours, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late night and early morning, with strong southwesterly to southerly winds developing, consistent with a shift in airflow associated with the low-pressure development. These conditions together suggest a dynamic transition in weather patterns, potentially bringing changing skies, possible precipitation, and cooler, windier conditions in the near term.
