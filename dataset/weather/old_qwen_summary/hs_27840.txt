Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of a moisture-laden air mass and potential for fog or dew formation. A sharp increase in air pressure during the early morning hours was followed by a significant drop later in the day, hinting at the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more variable and then westerly directions, with sustained higher speeds during the early morning and late afternoon, consistent with boundary layer mixing and possible frontal influences. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind direction points to dynamic atmospheric conditions that could lead to unstable weather, including the potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
