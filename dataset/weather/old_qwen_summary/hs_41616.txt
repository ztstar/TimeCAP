Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass and potential for clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest the passage of a frontal boundary, with the potential for improved weather conditions and reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
