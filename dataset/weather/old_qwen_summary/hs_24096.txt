Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a clear diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight rise in the early morning and a minor fluctuation later, suggesting a weak but steady high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to more easterly, signaling a possible change in airflow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight period to a more dynamic, warming day, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity.
