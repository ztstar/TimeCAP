Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of increasing solar radiation and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the midday, indicating a transition from saturated to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the buildup of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, potentially contributing to the mixing of air layers and dispersion of moisture. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly sectors suggests the passage of a frontal boundary, likely signaling the end of a moist, unstable period and the arrival of drier, more settled conditions.
