Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Temperature trends showed a nighttime cooling phase followed by a gradual warming, particularly during midday and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by shifting cloud cover and wind patterns. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking during periods of low pressure, which contributed to foggy conditions and a heavy, damp feel. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and north, likely associated with frontal passage and atmospheric instability. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and variable wind directions suggests a dynamic weather transition, with potential for precipitation and changing conditions later in the day.
