Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the morning, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before declining steadily through the day, suggesting a shift from foggy or damp conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable increase around midday, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally low overnight but strengthened in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may indicate the influence of a changing synoptic pattern. These combined trends suggest the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of a more stable, sunnier afternoon, typical of a summer day in San Francisco.
