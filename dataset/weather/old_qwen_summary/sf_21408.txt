Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover during the night. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no significant weather systems approaching. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and westerly sectors, particularly in the early morning, which may reflect changing boundary layer dynamics. These conditions point to a typical marine layer pattern, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely resulting in cool, foggy mornings and clearer, warmer afternoons.
