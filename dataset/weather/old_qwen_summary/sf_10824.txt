Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and possibly marine layer formation. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning, coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which suggests the development of fog or low-lying clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. A notable rise in air pressure occurred during the evening, followed by a gradual decline overnight, hinting at the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for improving conditions in the coming hours. Wind patterns displayed a shift from predominantly offshore (westerly and northwesterly) to more variable directions, with a brief increase in wind speed and a change in direction toward the northeast during the late night, possibly indicating a transition in local circulation. The combination of low temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind directions points to a strong marine layer influence, likely responsible for foggy conditions and cooler coastal temperatures, which is consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
