Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually recovering in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the daytime, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level during midday, which suggests the influence of a strong high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief surge in the early morning followed by a period of calm, particularly during the early hours, before modest increases resumed in the late afternoon. Wind direction shifted dramatically overnight—from northwest to northeast and then to southeast by the evening—hinting at a change in air mass and potential for evolving weather patterns later in the day.
