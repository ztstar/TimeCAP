Influenza activity has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in positivity rates during the most recent months, indicating widespread circulation. The dominance of Influenza A has steadily increased, outpacing Influenza B in both absolute numbers and proportional representation, suggesting a shift toward A-driven transmission. The peak in positivity ratios occurred in the last quarter of the period, followed by a notable decline, which may reflect waning transmission or increased testing volume diluting case counts. The ratio of Influenza B has remained relatively stable post-peak, maintaining a consistent proportion of total cases despite absolute declines. These trends highlight a mature epidemic phase with diminishing but still elevated activity, warranting continued surveillance and preparedness for potential resurgence.
