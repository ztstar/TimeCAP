Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests strong overnight cooling and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased during the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, possibly indicating the influence of a developing boundary or frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing winds points to a transition toward more stable and potentially dry conditions later in the day, with limited risk of precipitation.
