Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating the arrival of a more stable, warmer air mass. Humidity remained near saturation during the early morning hours before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the air warmed. A sustained decline in air pressure in the early hours was followed by a slight recovery, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong and variable, particularly from the northwest, but diminished markedly during midday, with calm periods observed, likely due to the influence of a temporary high-pressure buildup. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly later in the day indicates a change in airflow, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather pattern with milder conditions.
