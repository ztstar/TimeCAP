Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture layer that dissipated with solar warming. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the period, with a notable increase during the late night and early morning, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon—consistent with the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a marked increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating possible changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which may increase the risk of localized convective activity later in the day.
