Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rebound in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clearing skies and solar heating. Humidity levels showed a pronounced inverse pattern, remaining elevated during the early morning and midday before plummeting in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass or a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a low level, which is often associated with approaching or ongoing weather systems such as a frontal passage. Wind speeds increased gradually overnight and remained consistent in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, pointing to a change in atmospheric circulation that may have brought in drier, more stable air. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight period to a drier, more energetic daytime environment, potentially increasing fire risk and creating conditions favorable for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture were to return.
