Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the presence of moist air likely associated with a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, stabilizing later before a slight rebound, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics consistent with storm development. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, signaling the influence of a frontal boundary or approaching weather system. These combined patterns suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, particularly as warm, moist air continues to interact with the shifting pressure and wind patterns.
