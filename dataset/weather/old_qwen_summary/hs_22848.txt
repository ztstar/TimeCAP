Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a saturated atmosphere conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies later. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, signaling a change in air mass and possible storm development. These combined patterns suggest a transition period with high moisture content and increasing stability, potentially leading to morning fog and a slight chance of showers as the air mass adjusts.
