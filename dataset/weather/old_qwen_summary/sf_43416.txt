Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late morning, only to surge again in the late evening, indicating possible fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the period, with a slight increase in the late night, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no major weather system passing through. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, particularly from the southwest and west, contributing to the cooling effect and potential fog dispersal, before subsiding and shifting direction in the late evening. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating winds, and a cooling trend points to the likelihood of fog development during the night and early morning, which may impact visibility and travel conditions.
