Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high through the early hours, peaking in the overnight period, before declining sharply in the mid-morning, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. A marked increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop just before dawn, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, but a strong surge developed in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to southeast, consistent with a coastal onshore flow. These combined patterns point to the arrival of a maritime influence, likely bringing cooler, more humid air and potential fog development, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
