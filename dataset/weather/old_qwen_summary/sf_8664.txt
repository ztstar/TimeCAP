Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the late night and early morning, reaching their lowest point before rising again in the late afternoon, indicating a drying trend associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day, with a brief dip in the early evening and a pronounced increase toward the end of the period, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the day, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then to the west-southwest in the final hours, indicating changing flow patterns near the coast. These conditions point to a transition from maritime influence to a more stable, drier air mass, likely enhancing clear skies and improving visibility in the coming hours.
