Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked at near-saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-lying cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low except in the final few hours, when they picked up slightly and shifted toward the southeast, suggesting a possible change in airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting wind direction implies a lingering marine influence, consistent with typical coastal fog dynamics in the region.
