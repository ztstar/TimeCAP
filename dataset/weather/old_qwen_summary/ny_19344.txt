A persistent drop in temperature during the early hours was followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold, stable night to a milder day. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the overnight and early morning hours, contributing to foggy or misty conditions, before declining sharply as temperatures rose. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-range by midday—consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from the west and northwest, suggesting the onset of stronger airflow associated with the developing weather system. Combined, these patterns suggest that New York City is experiencing the influence of an approaching frontal system, which may bring precipitation and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
