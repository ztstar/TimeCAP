Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as daylight returned. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, remaining near saturation until mid-morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation earlier in the day. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger gusts and shifting wind directions, possibly signaling the approach of a boundary or the tail end of a weather system. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable, dry, and potentially breezy conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
