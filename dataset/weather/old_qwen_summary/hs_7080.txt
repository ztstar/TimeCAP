Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, particularly in the pre-dawn period. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late morning, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weak front or localized atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These conditions point to a transition from a stable, moist boundary layer to a more dynamic regime, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
