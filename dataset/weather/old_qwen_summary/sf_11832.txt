Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the pre-dawn and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily increased through the morning and peaked in the late afternoon before slightly declining, reflecting the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the west to southwest, potentially facilitating the movement of marine air and influencing coastal temperature patterns. The shift in wind direction from near-zero (calm or variable) to consistent southwesterly flow may indicate the onset of a sea breeze or a change in synoptic-scale flow, contributing to the current atmospheric dynamics.
