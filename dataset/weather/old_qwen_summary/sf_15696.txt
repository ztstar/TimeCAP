Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining through the night, suggesting the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, remaining high through the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night, peaking mid-morning before easing slightly, signaling the arrival and subsequent weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, shifting from southwesterly to southerly and then to more variable directions, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, likely due to changes in local thermal gradients. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a coastal frontal system, leading to cooler, more humid conditions overnight and clearing skies with strengthening offshore winds by late afternoon.
