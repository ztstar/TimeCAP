Over the past 24 hours, temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling period, with the lowest values recorded in the early morning hours, suggesting a significant overnight drop. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the morning, which may have contributed to the formation of fog or low visibility. Air pressure steadily decreased through the day, reaching its lowest point in the early evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwesterly to northeasterly, indicating a change in the prevailing airflow. These combined factors suggest the onset of a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially leading to precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
