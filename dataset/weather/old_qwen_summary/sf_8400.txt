Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that brought drier and clearer conditions later in the day. Wind speeds intensified toward the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These developments reflect a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer to a drier, more dynamic atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more variable conditions in the coming hours.
