Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the upper 90s, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle during those periods. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with slight fluctuations suggesting a stationary front or weak system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts of stronger wind in the late afternoon and evening, likely linked to localized convection or shifting surface gradients. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and westerly sectors suggests a change in air mass, potentially bringing drier and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
