Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a slight warming in the late afternoon, indicating a stabilization of near-surface temperatures. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining high throughout the day, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late night and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or maritime influence. Wind speeds increased steadily after midday, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast and eventually to the southwest, indicating a change in airflow likely driven by coastal dynamics. These combined factors point to a maritime-influenced weather pattern with persistent fog and cool conditions, which are characteristic of San Francisco’s coastal climate during transitional periods.
