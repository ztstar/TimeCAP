Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of a nocturnal fog or low-level moisture layer. Air pressure steadily increased over the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, weakening into mid-morning before increasing again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southeasterly to more westerly and then northerly, pointing to changing air mass dynamics. This combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds indicates the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improved conditions for outdoor activities and reduced risk of thunderstorms in the near term.
