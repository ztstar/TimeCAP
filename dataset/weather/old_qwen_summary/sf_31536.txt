Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant temperature drop in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, a common occurrence in the region during fall and winter. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure system that has likely contributed to the calm and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable surge in the final hours, driven by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, possibly indicating the influence of a coastal breeze or approaching weather systems. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable winds points to a high likelihood of foggy or overcast conditions, particularly in the early morning and evening, which can impact visibility and commuter travel.
