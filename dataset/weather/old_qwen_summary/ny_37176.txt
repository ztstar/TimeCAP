Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred overnight, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, indicating condensation and potential precipitation, with saturated air persisting through mid-morning. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is characteristic of an approaching or passing storm system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly, aligning with storm dynamics and the movement of a low-pressure center. These combined indicators suggest a period of unstable, potentially stormy weather, with a likely transition to more moderate conditions as the pressure stabilizes and the system moves eastward.
