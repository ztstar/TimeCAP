Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions and a noticeable dampness in the air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, coinciding with increased humidity and calm winds, indicating a possible influence from a low-pressure system or approaching front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and later southerly again, with a strengthening breeze in the late evening, suggesting dynamic atmospheric changes. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, potentially signaling the approach of a storm system, with implications for increased rainfall and unstable weather in the near term.
