Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually increasing through the day, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling followed by daytime warming. Humidity surged to saturation levels during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or light precipitation, which likely contributed to the cooler feel despite rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to south and then back to west, reflecting changing circulation patterns associated with the passing weather system. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a gradually improving, drier day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
