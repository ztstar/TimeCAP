Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before gradually declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a stable air mass that initially suppressed convection. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, which may indicate the passage of a weather front or a developing low-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest and eventually to the west, consistent with changing synoptic conditions that could signal storm development. The combination of rising temperatures, declining humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more unstable conditions, raising the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
