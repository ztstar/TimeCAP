Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching near-saturated conditions during the early hours, which likely contributed to increased fog formation and reduced visibility in coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a consistent high-pressure influence, though a brief drop late in the period may signal the approach of a weak weather disturbance. Wind patterns shifted notably, with stronger and more variable winds in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the influence of offshore flow and possible katabatic effects, particularly from the west and southwest. These combined factors point to a typical marine layer development cycle, common in San Francisco, where cool, moist air settles at night and disperses with morning sun and wind shifts.
