Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speed increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast, consistent with inflow ahead of a developing weather disturbance. These combined trends point to a transition toward potentially unstable and rainy weather, especially as the system continues to influence the region.
