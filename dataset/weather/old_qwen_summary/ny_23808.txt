Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual warming during the afternoon and evening, suggesting increasing heat accumulation, likely due to reduced cloud cover and rising solar exposure. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, creating a muggy atmosphere, before beginning to drop as the system evolved. Wind patterns shifted significantly, transitioning from southerly to westerly and then to a more easterly direction, signaling a change in airflow likely linked to the low-pressure development. These combined indicators point to a developing storm system that may bring precipitation and stronger winds later in the day, posing potential impacts on outdoor activities and travel in New York City.
