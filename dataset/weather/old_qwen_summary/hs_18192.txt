Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, suggesting moist air accumulation followed by dispersion. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clear and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing through the late afternoon and remaining light in the evening, with wind direction shifting from northeasterly to southeasterly, consistent with a weakening sea breeze. Collectively, these trends point to a transition from a humid, stable night into a warming, drier day under the influence of a high-pressure ridge, with minimal storm risk but potential for increasing discomfort as temperatures rise.
