Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rebounding in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early hours, peaking during the night before declining sharply in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a brief low-pressure dip followed by a sustained high-pressure build-up, suggesting the passage of a weather system and the arrival of more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially overnight and into the early morning, reaching a peak before calming down, while wind direction shifted from northerly to southerly and later to easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a maritime-influenced, moist environment to a drier, more stable regime, likely associated with the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of clearer skies.
