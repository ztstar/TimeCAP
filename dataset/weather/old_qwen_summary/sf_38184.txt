Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by atmospheric changes. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the morning, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions before transitioning into more variable weather. Wind speeds increased significantly, especially in the late evening and early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, which helped disperse fog but also contributed to turbulent conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests a change in large-scale airflow, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather system influencing the region.
