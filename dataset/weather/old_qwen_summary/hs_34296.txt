Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early hours, remaining near saturation for several consecutive hours, indicating the presence of moist, unstable air likely associated with a low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the day, suggesting the approach of a frontal system or storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to northeasterly, which often precedes storm activity in this region. These combined factors point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially given the high moisture content and dynamic wind patterns.
