Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to a marked increase in fog and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure showed a strong rise through the morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system, which stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased during the midday, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions point to a dry, stable, and relatively calm environment in the late afternoon, with minimal potential for precipitation.
