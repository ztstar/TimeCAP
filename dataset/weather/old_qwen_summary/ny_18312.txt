Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a notable rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increased solar exposure and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained low in the early morning hours before rising significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a possible influx of moist air, which could contribute to cloud formation or precipitation later. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase in the early evening, followed by a sudden drop in the late night, signaling the passage of a weather front that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system. These combined indicators suggest the potential for changing weather, including possible storms or rain, particularly in the coming hours.
