Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained nearly stable throughout the period, suggesting a lack of significant weather systems passing through, with only minor fluctuations. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable period of calm conditions during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the development of fog. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and eventually southeast during the day suggests a change in airflow, possibly due to local topography or a developing sea breeze, which could influence visibility and temperature in the coming hours.
