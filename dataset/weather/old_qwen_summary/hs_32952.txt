Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating the influence of a diurnal cycle with nocturnal cooling and daytime warming. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to increased cloud formation and a higher chance of precipitation. Air pressure showed a fluctuating trend, with a notable rise during midday and a subsequent decline, hinting at shifting weather systems, possibly a passing front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with variable directions—particularly from the east and southeast—indicating potential moisture influx from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the potential for thunderstorms or heavy showers, particularly during the overnight hours.
