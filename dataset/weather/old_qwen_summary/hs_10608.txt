Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or high moisture content in the air. A consistent increase in air pressure during the early period was followed by a sharp decline in the late evening and overnight hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained low except for a brief period of increased flow in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate a transition in air mass movement. These combined factors suggest a developing weather pattern conducive to potential thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
