Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought widespread moisture and unstable conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a persistent damp feel and likely supported cloud formation and precipitation. Wind patterns shifted notably, with a strong increase in speed and a change in direction from southeasterly to northerly and then westerly, suggesting the influence of a frontal boundary or storm system. The temperature trend showed a gradual rise through the day, followed by a sharp drop in the early morning hours, consistent with the passage of a cold front. These combined factors point to a period of unsettled weather, with a high likelihood of rain or showers, particularly in the early morning, and a transition toward cooler, drier conditions later in the day.
