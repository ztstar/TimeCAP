Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually warming through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation before dropping significantly, suggesting a period of precipitation or fog followed by clearing conditions. Air pressure exhibited a gradual increase, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the drying trend and improving visibility. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to northwesterly directions, with strengthening gusts in the late afternoon, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. Collectively, these changes point to a transition from a moist, stable night into a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, consistent with a passing front and improving weather conditions.
