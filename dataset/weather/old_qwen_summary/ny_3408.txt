Temperature steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity dropped sharply during the early hours, remaining low and stable through midday, suggesting dry air dominance after initial moisture depletion. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, signaling improving weather conditions and the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning, then weakened significantly during midday before a sudden surge in the late afternoon, likely due to a localized weather disturbance. Wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then southerly again, reflecting changing air flow patterns associated with the approaching high-pressure system.
