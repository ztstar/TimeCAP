Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation during the overnight and early morning period, indicating the presence of fog or low stratus clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature decline. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the early hours, suggesting a persistent low-pressure influence that supported the moist, cool conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent throughout most of the period, shifting from a southwest to a more southerly direction in the afternoon, which may have facilitated the movement of marine air into the region. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and consistent wind patterns strongly indicates a prolonged marine layer event typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate.
