Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking at near-saturated conditions, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during early hours. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changes in conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but picked up in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, suggesting potential for increased marine layer influence. These combined trends indicate a transition period likely associated with the passage of a low-pressure system, increasing the chance of overcast skies and possible drizzle in the coming hours.
