Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again during the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clear and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with near-zero values between midnight and 3 AM, but increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal onshore flow. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly directions late in the day may signal changing airflow patterns, potentially influencing the dissipation of fog and the return of clearer skies.
