Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising toward the end of the period. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike in the middle of the night, indicating potential nighttime condensation or fog formation, followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the pre-dawn hours, with stronger gusts from the southwest, then diminished significantly in the afternoon, coinciding with the drop in humidity and stabilization of pressure. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing drier, cooler air and contributing to fairer conditions later in the day.
