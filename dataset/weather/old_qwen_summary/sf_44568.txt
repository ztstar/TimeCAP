Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent values indicate a prolonged period of atmospheric equilibrium, suggesting the absence of approaching weather systems such as fronts or storms. The persistent wind from the southeast suggests a stable marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, which helps maintain cool, dry conditions near the surface. The low humidity levels point to limited moisture availability, reducing the likelihood of fog or precipitation despite the marine layer presence. Overall, the weather has remained calm and unchanging, consistent with a high-pressure regime that suppresses cloud development and maintains clear skies.
