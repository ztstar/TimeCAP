Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, with conditions remaining saturated for more than 12 consecutive hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low stratus cloud cover. Temperature trends showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, consistent with typical marine layer dynamics. Air pressure remained stable overnight before gradually increasing, suggesting the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were modest throughout, with consistent easterly to northerly flow, reinforcing the presence of onshore maritime air that supports fog formation. These combined factors point to a persistent marine layer that has dominated the region, likely resulting in overcast skies and cool, damp conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
