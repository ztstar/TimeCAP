Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicating a clear cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable increase, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate until late evening, when they intensified from the northwest, likely associated with a shift in atmospheric circulation and the influence of the developing high-pressure ridge. Together, these indicators point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with improved visibility and generally pleasant conditions expected in the near term.
