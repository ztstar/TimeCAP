Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking above 97%, indicating strong moisture accumulation, likely due to marine layer formation. Air pressure remained stable through the night before a slight decline in the late evening, suggesting possible atmospheric changes consistent with shifting weather patterns. Wind speeds were low and consistent throughout the night, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal flow dynamics. These conditions point to a persistent marine influence, with high humidity and cool temperatures typical of San Francisco’s fog-prone climate, potentially leading to fog or low stratus clouds during the early morning hours.
