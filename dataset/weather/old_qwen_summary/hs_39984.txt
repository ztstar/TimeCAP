Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming throughout the day, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, before declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to a drier, more convective environment. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night and early morning, stabilizing before a further decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the west and northwest, hinting at changing synoptic flow and potential storm development. Combined, these indicators suggest increasing atmospheric instability and the likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day.
