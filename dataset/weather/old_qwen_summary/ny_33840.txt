Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a warming daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before steadily decreasing, suggesting the presence of overnight moisture accumulation likely due to a stable air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is indicative of a passing low-pressure system that may have brought the earlier moisture. Wind speeds gradually increased through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then southerly again in the evening, reflecting changing flow patterns associated with the approaching system. The combined trends point to a developing weather pattern involving a weakening low-pressure system, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
