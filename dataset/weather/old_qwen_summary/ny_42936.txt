Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cool overnight period. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting possible fog formation during the night followed by clearing. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, with a slight upward trend in the early hours and a steady plateau later, signaling stable, high-pressure conditions favorable for clear skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, reflecting a change in air flow possibly linked to a passing front. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition from a stable, cool, and humid overnight period to a drier, warmer, and more stable daytime atmosphere under a dominant high-pressure system.
