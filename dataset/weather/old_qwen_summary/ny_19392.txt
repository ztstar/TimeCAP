Temperatures showed a steady decline throughout the period, indicating a persistent cooling trend likely driven by a cold air mass moving into the region. Humidity levels remained relatively high during the early hours before dropping significantly in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier air as the cold front advanced. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the latter half of the observation window, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift toward more northerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with the influence of an approaching cold front. Together, these indicators point to a transition toward colder, drier, and more stable weather in New York City, with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility in the near term.
