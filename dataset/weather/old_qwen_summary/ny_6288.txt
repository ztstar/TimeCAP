Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a pronounced overnight dip followed by a steady recovery, indicating a clear diurnal cycle with cooler conditions during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking around dawn, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable pressure increase occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more stable conditions, which may indicate the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow during the night and early morning, evolving into more variable directions later in the day. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable wind patterns points toward improving weather conditions and a likely transition to clearer skies in the coming hours.
