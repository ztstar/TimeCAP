Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which indicates the presence of fog or dew formation, likely contributing to reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase overnight, culminating in a high-pressure system that stabilized in the morning and has since begun to decline slightly, suggesting a transition in atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to more variable directions, with a notable rise in speed during the late evening and early morning hours, possibly signaling a change in weather front dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and fluctuating wind directions suggests a lingering chance of fog or light precipitation in the coming hours, particularly in low-lying areas.
