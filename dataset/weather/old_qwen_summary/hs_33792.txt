Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the day, indicating a shift from a more saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a distinct drop during the night, suggesting the influence of an approaching low-pressure system, which may have contributed to increased moisture and wind activity. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly, consistent with a developing synoptic-scale disturbance. These patterns collectively suggest a transition period marked by unstable conditions, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
