Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained persistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. A steady decline in atmospheric pressure was observed, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the final hours, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and south, potentially indicating the onset of a frontal passage or developing storm activity. Combined, these trends suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially stormy conditions, with increasing risks of thunderstorms in the near term.
