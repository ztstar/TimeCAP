Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of overnight condensation and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. The sustained increase in wind speed and change in direction point to dynamic atmospheric conditions, likely associated with a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of unsettled weather, including possible precipitation and thunderstorms later in the day.
