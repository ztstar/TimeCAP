- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained and significant upward trend over the past 20 weeks, reflecting a progressive increase in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. The peak occurred around the 15th week, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting the emergence and subsequent waning of a strong influenza season. This pattern indicates a seasonal surge with a clear onset, peak, and resolution, which may signal the need for targeted public health interventions and resource planning during similar periods in the future.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a clear upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid and sustained increase in influenza A positivity, peaking during the latter half of this period. A sharp decline follows the peak, with a significant drop in cases over the subsequent five weeks, suggesting the possible end or waning phase of a dominant influenza wave. The pattern indicates a typical seasonal epidemic curve, with potential implications for healthcare preparedness, resource allocation, and the need for continued surveillance to detect any resurgence.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator shows a sustained and steep increase in positivity rates, peaking sharply in the latter half of the observation period, indicating a significant and accelerating influenza B outbreak. The trajectory suggests a transition from moderate to high-level circulation, with the highest values observed during the most recent weeks, likely reflecting peak seasonal activity. The subsequent decline after the peak may signal the onset of a natural plateau or waning phase, though continued surveillance is essential to confirm the duration and impact of this surge.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a sharp and steady increase in influenza positivity, indicative of a growing respiratory virus circulation. A peak was reached in the 15th week, followed by a marked decline over the subsequent five weeks, suggesting a potential waning of the current influenza wave. The rapid descent post-peak, coupled with a return to levels below half the peak value, implies a possible end to the surge phase, though continued monitoring is essential to detect any resurgence or early signs of another wave.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator exhibited a sustained upward trend over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid acceleration in influenza A positivity, culminating in a peak during the latter half of the period. Following the peak, a sharp decline was observed in the final five weeks, suggesting a waning phase of the influenza season or potential reductions in transmission. The magnitude of the increase and subsequent decrease indicates a strong seasonal pattern, with implications for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and public health messaging.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator has shown a consistent upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the upward trend beginning in week 11, indicating a significant increase in influenza B positivity. The peak values observed in the final weeks suggest the onset of a strong seasonal influenza B wave, with sustained high levels indicating ongoing community transmission. This prolonged elevation beyond typical seasonal patterns may signal heightened public health concern, warranting increased surveillance, preparedness, and potential intervention strategies.
