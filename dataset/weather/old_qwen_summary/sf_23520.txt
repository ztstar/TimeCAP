Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence and fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual upward trend in the latter part of the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the west-southwest, which aligns with typical coastal wind patterns and may have contributed to the dispersion of fog and the stabilization of conditions. Overall, the data suggests a transition from damp, foggy conditions to drier, more stable air, with favorable weather likely developing as the high-pressure system consolidates.
