Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of daytime heating and convective processes. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and sustained presence of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds picked up in the late afternoon and remained strong, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to more westerly and easterly patterns, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, unstable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, with potential for isolated thunderstorms if moisture reaccumulates.
