Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cooling front. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the pre-dawn period, suggesting potential for fog or dew formation, which then declined significantly as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings fair weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased slightly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast, possibly indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, stable overnight period to a drier, more stable daytime regime, likely resulting in clear skies and comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
