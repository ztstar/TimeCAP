Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, reaching saturation and remaining high through the night, indicating the presence of stable, moist air that likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions and consistent wind direction, but increased significantly in the evening and overnight, with a shift to more variable and stronger southerly to easterly flow. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable environment to a more dynamic, drier regime, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or changing weather pattern.
