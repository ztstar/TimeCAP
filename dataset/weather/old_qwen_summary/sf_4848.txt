Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, indicating the dissipation of fog or low-level cloud cover. A notable pressure increase during the early morning hours was followed by a significant drop in the late evening, signaling a possible passage of a weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low overnight but intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a shift toward more variable wind directions, which may reflect changing circulation patterns near the coast. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more dynamic environment, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
