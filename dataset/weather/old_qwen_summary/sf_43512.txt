Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping in the late morning, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night and early morning, then gradually increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the night, with a notable increase in the evening hours, while wind direction shifted from westerly to more northerly and then southerly, reflecting changing local flow patterns. Together, these trends indicate a transition from a cool, moist, and slightly windy night to a drier, warmer, and calmer afternoon, consistent with the typical marine layer dynamics of the San Francisco Bay Area.
