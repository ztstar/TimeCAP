Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, indicating a potential shift toward more stable, saturated air. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather. Wind speeds remained relatively low overnight but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable gust in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southeasterly. These combined trends point to the arrival of a frontal system, bringing the likelihood of precipitation and a more unsettled weather pattern in the coming hours.
