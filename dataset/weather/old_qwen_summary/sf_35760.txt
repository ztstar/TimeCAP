Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a high-pressure system was in place and began to weaken. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southerly, and later to easterly, signaling a change in local wind patterns possibly linked to coastal dynamics. These conditions together suggest a transition from stable, fog-prone conditions to a more variable regime, potentially influencing visibility and comfort levels across the city.
