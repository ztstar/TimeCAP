A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking near saturation, which, combined with cooling temperatures, created an environment conducive to fog and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the same period, particularly from the south-southeast, suggesting the influence of a developing storm system. The shift in wind direction from west to south-southeast and then to the south further supports the arrival of moist, unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors point to an active weather pattern, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the coming hours.
