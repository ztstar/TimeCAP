Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold nocturnal period followed by a modest warming trend. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which suggests saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour span, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate to strong, particularly in the afternoon and evening, with winds consistently blowing from the southwest to west sectors, suggesting a shift in air mass dynamics. Taken together, these trends point to a transition from a cold, damp, and stable air mass toward improving conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and a gradual temperature rebound in the coming hours.
