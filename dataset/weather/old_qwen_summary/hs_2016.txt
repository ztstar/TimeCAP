Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, remaining near saturation before plummeting sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a significant drying phase. Air pressure steadily declined through the early morning hours, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which suggests the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from consistent southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, with increasing gusts in the late afternoon, likely driven by the approaching system. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by cooling, drying, and dynamic wind changes, potentially signaling the arrival of a more stable, drier air mass.
