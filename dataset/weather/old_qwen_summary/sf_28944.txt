Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of high humidity, remaining near saturation for most of the night and early morning, which likely contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend typical of marine layer conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline during the early hours, followed by a brief spike and a subsequent drop, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or shifting frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, likely indicating the arrival of a more dynamic flow from the inland areas or a shift in the prevailing wind pattern. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind directions points to a classic coastal fog event, with potential for lingering low clouds and damp conditions into the early morning hours.
