Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could contribute to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the final hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the overnight and early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, signaling a change in air mass and possible storm development. These combined trends suggest an evolving weather system that may result in precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
