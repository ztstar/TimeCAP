Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly in the early morning and mid-morning periods, indicating persistent moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a continuous upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours but decreased significantly overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more southerly and later to easterly, reflecting a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, dropping winds, and stable temperatures points to the onset of a drier, more settled weather pattern in the coming hours.
