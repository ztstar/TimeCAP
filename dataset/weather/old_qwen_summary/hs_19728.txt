Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in atmospheric pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting warming conditions, likely linked to the influx of moist air and reduced nighttime cooling. Humidity remained extremely high, with near-saturation levels persisting, creating a muggy atmosphere conducive to precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the early and mid-day, but decreased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction suggesting a change in air mass flow, possibly from a developing frontal boundary. These combined conditions point to a high probability of rain or thunderstorms, particularly in the evening and overnight hours, with potential for localized flooding due to the saturated air and stagnant wind patterns.
