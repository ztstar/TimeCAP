Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature rise during the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a gradual cooling trend overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the morning hours before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal moisture buildup and subsequent daytime drying. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the early morning hours, followed by a steady decline, which may reflect the passage of a transient high-pressure system or localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southerly sectors, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a low-level convergence zone. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a stable, humid nighttime environment to a drier, warmer daytime regime, with conditions conducive to afternoon thunderstorm development if sufficient lift is introduced.
