Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly during the day, indicating a shift from a damp, foggy atmosphere to more moderate conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a brief spike in the early hours may have signaled a localized atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds were generally light, with a consistent breeze during the early and late hours, and wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly during the morning, potentially reflecting a change in local circulation patterns. These trends suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone environment to a more stable and slightly warmer regime, which could influence visibility and comfort levels in the coming hours.
