Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent values indicate a prolonged period of atmospheric equilibrium, suggesting the absence of active weather systems such as fronts or storms. Low humidity levels point to dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk, particularly in nearby coastal and hillside areas. The steady wind from the southeast has maintained gentle flow, lacking the stronger onshore breezes typical of coastal fog formation, implying limited fog development during this period. Overall, the weather has been calm and dry, offering favorable conditions for outdoor activities but potentially exacerbating drought-related concerns.
