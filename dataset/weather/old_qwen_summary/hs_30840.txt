Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a period of moist air advection followed by drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity, though a slight increase in the late afternoon may hint at the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were low during the night, increasing substantially in the afternoon, particularly from the south-southeast, which likely contributed to the warming trend and moisture transport. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southerly in the evening suggests changing flow patterns consistent with a developing sea breeze or localized convection, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
