Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front or a shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to more variable directions, with increased speeds in the late afternoon and evening, possibly enhancing mixing and dispersing low-level moisture. These conditions point to a transition period, likely bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day, with potential for improving visibility and higher daytime temperatures.
