Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cold night to a milder day. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before plummeting during midday, suggesting a possible clearing trend as drier air moved in. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise slightly, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds from the south and southwest, likely due to a developing pressure gradient. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests improving conditions, potentially leading to clearer skies and more favorable weather later in the day.
