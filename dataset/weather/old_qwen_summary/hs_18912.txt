Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning a notable drop during the late afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to the influence of a developing frontal system, potentially leading to thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
