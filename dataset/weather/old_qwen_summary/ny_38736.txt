Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight period, peaking in the late evening before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were highest during the early morning and late night, with strong gusts from the northwest and west-northwest sectors, likely contributing to the cooling trend. The shift in wind direction and the overall atmospheric stability suggest that a cold front has passed, leaving behind cooler, drier air and setting the stage for a gradual warming trend in the coming hours.
