Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, suggesting increased moisture availability that could support afternoon convection. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend, with minimal fluctuations, signaling generally stable atmospheric conditions without immediate storm development. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, indicating a possible change in air mass or localized circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind direction points to a potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as daytime heating intensifies.
