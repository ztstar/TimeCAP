Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the night, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling trend. Air pressure rose significantly in the early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that brought stable, calm conditions. Wind speeds diminished to near-zero during the early morning, with winds shifting from northeast to southeast by late morning, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns point to a period of coastal fog and reduced wind, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for continued cool, damp conditions into the next day.
