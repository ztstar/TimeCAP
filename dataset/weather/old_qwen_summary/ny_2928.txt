Over the past 24 hours, temperature declined steadily through the night, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels dropped sharply after midnight, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions, which may have contributed to clearer skies. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic drop in the early morning hours, followed by a rapid rebound, signaling the passage of a strong low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with sustained strong winds from the southwest and west, consistent with storm dynamics. The combination of falling temperature, dropping pressure, and shifting wind patterns strongly suggests that a cold front or storm system passed through the region, potentially bringing precipitation and gusty winds earlier in the day.
