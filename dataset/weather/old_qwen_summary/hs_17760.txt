Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential for clearing skies or a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a continuous decline throughout the period, reaching its lowest point late in the day, which is often associated with approaching low-pressure systems and possible storm development. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a change from predominantly northerly and westerly flows to more southerly and easterly directions in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the influence of a developing disturbance. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind speeds, and shifting wind direction points to an active weather system likely moving into the region, raising the possibility of thunderstorms or rain later in the day.
