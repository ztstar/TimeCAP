Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from a drier to a more humid air mass. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained variable, with a notable lull in the early hours followed by increasing gusts in the afternoon, particularly from the west and northwest, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to more southerly and easterly patterns in the late afternoon suggests a possible change in airflow, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather system.
