Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low wind conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply during the same period, peaking in the early morning, which, combined with the temperature dip, suggests the formation of fog or low stratus clouds near the coast. Air pressure remained stable through much of the night but dropped significantly during the early morning, then rebounded sharply in the late morning, signaling the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, contributing to the temperature inversion and fog development, but increased notably in the afternoon, likely dispersing low cloud cover. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions reflects changing synoptic influences, possibly indicating a transition from marine influence to onshore flow, with potential implications for afternoon fog clearance and coastal temperatures.
