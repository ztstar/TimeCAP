Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, then declined sharply as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from saturated to drier air. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp drop followed by a brief rebound, signaling possible changes in atmospheric stability and the influence of passing weather systems. Wind patterns shifted from consistent easterly to southerly flows in the afternoon, accompanied by increasing wind speeds, which may indicate the approach of a developing frontal boundary. These combined trends suggest the potential for unsettled weather later in the day, including possible thunderstorm development due to moisture buildup and dynamic wind shifts.
