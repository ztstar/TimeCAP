Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the midday, indicating the passage of a moist air mass that likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and overnight hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a strong southerly component, which likely facilitated the onshore flow of maritime air. These combined factors point to a typical coastal marine influence, with nighttime fog, morning cooling, and afternoon warming, consistent with San Francisco’s temperate maritime climate.
