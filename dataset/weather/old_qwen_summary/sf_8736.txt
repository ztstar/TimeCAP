Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region's microclimate. Air pressure rose significantly during the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to westerly component, reinforcing the influence of coastal dynamics. These combined factors point to a typical marine layer scenario, with cool, damp conditions likely persisting into the next day.
