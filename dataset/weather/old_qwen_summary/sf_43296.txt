Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the morning. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, peaking in the early afternoon before declining slightly, indicating the passing of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics, possibly related to a coastal breeze cycle. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds points to a strong marine layer influence, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns, especially in the transitional period between night and day.
