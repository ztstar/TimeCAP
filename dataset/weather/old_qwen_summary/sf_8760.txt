Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which is typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure remained consistently high and stable throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that has suppressed storm development and contributed to clear skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast in the late evening, signaling a change in airflow that may precede a shift in weather patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal fog event driven by temperature inversions and maritime influence, with minimal precipitation risk and stable, cool conditions expected to persist.
