Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking around dawn before dropping dramatically during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase overnight, reaching a peak before declining significantly in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then to variable directions, with a notable increase in speed and a change in direction toward the west and northwest in the evening—consistent with a strengthening surface boundary. These combined changes point to the influence of a passing frontal system, potentially bringing thunderstorm activity or clearing conditions in the near term.
