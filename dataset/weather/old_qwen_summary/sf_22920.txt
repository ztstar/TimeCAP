Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests persistent fog or low cloud cover, particularly during the night and early morning. A steady increase in air pressure throughout the day reflects the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely contributing to stable and clearing conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, which may signal the onset of a sea breeze or a change in synoptic flow. These combined factors point to a transition from a foggy, cool night into a clearer, warmer, and breezier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the summer months.
