Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, particularly in the early morning hours, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure remained nearly constant, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of significant storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow that weakened during the night before increasing again in the late evening, likely contributing to the persistence of the marine layer. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal fog event, with potential for lingering low visibility and cool, damp conditions into the early evening.
