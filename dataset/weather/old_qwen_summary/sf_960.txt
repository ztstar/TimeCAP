Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late morning, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, which likely signaled the arrival of a high-pressure system stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night and early morning, with a marked increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, contributing to enhanced mixing and dispersion of the marine layer. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds points to a clear transition toward more stable, sunnier conditions in the coming hours.
