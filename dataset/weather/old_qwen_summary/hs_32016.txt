Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong warming trend likely driven by solar heating and changing air mass conditions. Humidity levels began near saturation and remained elevated through the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of a moist air mass and the onset of drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which typically correlates with the passage of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the day but decreased significantly overnight, with wind direction shifting frequently—especially from southeast to northeast—pointing to a change in airflow patterns possibly linked to a developing high-pressure influence. Together, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, unstable environment to a drier, more stable regime, signaling improving conditions with reduced chances of precipitation in the immediate future.
