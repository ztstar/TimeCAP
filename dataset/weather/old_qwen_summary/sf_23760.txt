Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure was observed in the final hours, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changes in conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to southeast, suggesting a change in airflow patterns consistent with an approaching frontal system. These combined indicators point to a transition period, possibly leading to overcast skies and a higher chance of precipitation in the near term.
