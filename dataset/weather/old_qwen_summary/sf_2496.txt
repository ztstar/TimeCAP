Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, indicating possible fog formation, which is typical for the region's microclimate. A notable rise in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially contributing to the mixing of air layers and dispersion of fog. The combination of rising pressure, moderate winds, and decreasing humidity suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, which may lead to improved visibility and warming temperatures in the coming hours.
