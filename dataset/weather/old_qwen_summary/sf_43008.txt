Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity remained near saturation during the overnight hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These patterns point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, which may lead to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
