Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and reduced comfort. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were subdued overnight, with calm periods and variable direction, but increased notably in the final hours, suggesting a shift in atmospheric dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime, with implications for evening thunderstorm potential.
