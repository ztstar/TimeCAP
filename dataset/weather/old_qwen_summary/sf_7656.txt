Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight uptick during the morning, hinting at a high-pressure influence that likely contributed to clearing skies. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly, reflecting a change in local synoptic flow. These conditions together suggest a transition from foggy, damp coastal conditions to clearer, drier, and slightly warmer weather by late afternoon, typical of a diurnal marine layer cycle.
