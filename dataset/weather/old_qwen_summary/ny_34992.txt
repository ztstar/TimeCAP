Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels decreased significantly throughout the day, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, suggesting drier air moving into the region. Air pressure increased notably in the late afternoon, peaking sharply before stabilizing, which typically signals the approach or passage of a high-pressure system associated with improving weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively consistent with a minor increase in the early afternoon, while wind direction shifted gradually from easterly to southeasterly and then back toward easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns. These trends collectively point to a transition toward more stable and drier conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
