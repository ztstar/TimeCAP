Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced temperature dip occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling a passing frontal system that may have brought the overnight precipitation or cloud cover. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from southerly to easterly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics and potential gusty conditions. Overall, the combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a transitional weather pattern, possibly setting the stage for unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
