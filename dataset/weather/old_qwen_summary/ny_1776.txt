Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping sharply as temperatures climbed, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind, and changing wind direction points to an active weather transition, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
