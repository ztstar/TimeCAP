Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly overnight and remaining low during early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure consistently rose throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable, clear skies and reduced chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before tapering off, with wind direction shifting from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition toward more stable and drier conditions later in the day, with clearing skies likely as the high-pressure system consolidates.
