Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely influenced by marine layer development. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation for extended periods, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the early morning hours. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decrease, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring continued overcast conditions and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the latter part of the period, with stronger, more consistent winds from a southerly to southwesterly direction, which may enhance coastal fog advection and moderate daytime temperatures. Overall, the combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a stable marine layer with potential for foggy and cool conditions persisting into the near term.
