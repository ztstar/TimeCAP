Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady increase in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity remained elevated throughout the day, with a notable spike in the late evening, suggesting moisture accumulation that could promote convective activity. Air pressure steadily declined, especially during the mid to late night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light but increased in the late afternoon and early evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing weather disturbance. Together, these indicators suggest the potential for thunderstorm development, particularly during the overnight hours, due to the combination of warmth, high humidity, and a weakening pressure system.
