Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of stable, cold temperatures with a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels showed a distinct pattern, starting high, decreasing significantly during the early morning, and then rising again in the late afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass characteristics. Air pressure exhibited a clear dip during the early morning, followed by a steady increase, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a high-pressure ridge.
