Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal moderation. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, then declined sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog and increasing air stability. Air pressure showed a slight rise during midday, peaking before a gradual decline, which may signal the passage of a weak high-pressure system or an approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief lulls and isolated gusts, while wind direction fluctuated widely, reflecting shifting local wind patterns likely driven by topography and sea-breeze dynamics. Together, these conditions suggest a transition from a cool, foggy night to a clearer, warmer afternoon, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic variability and coastal influence.
