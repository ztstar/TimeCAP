Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a damp and chilly feel. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred through the night, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with stormy or unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the east and southeast, consistent with a developing frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly sectors, combined with falling pressure and high moisture, points to an active weather front moving through the region, potentially bringing precipitation in the near term.
