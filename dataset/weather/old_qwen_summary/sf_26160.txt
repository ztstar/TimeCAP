Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the mid-morning, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a pronounced increase in the afternoon, particularly from the west and south, suggesting changing wind patterns possibly linked to coastal dynamics. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to southerly and easterly in the evening, coupled with rising pressure, points to the potential arrival of a high-pressure ridge, which could bring clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
