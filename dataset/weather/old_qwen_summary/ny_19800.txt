Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady and significant drop in temperature, indicating a strong cold front moving through the region. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated overnight before sharply declining, suggesting clearing skies and drier air as the front passed. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, culminating in a sharp increase during the early morning hours, a classic signature of an approaching high-pressure system bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated, with a notable surge during the late night and early morning, coinciding with the passage of the cold front and a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west. The combination of dropping temperatures, falling humidity, rising pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition from overcast, damp conditions to cooler, drier, and more stable weather in the coming hours.
