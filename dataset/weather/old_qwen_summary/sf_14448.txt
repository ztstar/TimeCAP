Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, with a sharp drop during midday, indicating a drying trend likely due to increased wind and clearing skies. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated dramatically, with strong gusts in the pre-dawn and early afternoon, primarily from the west and northwest, contributing to rapid temperature changes and dispersion of moisture. These combined factors point to a transition from a foggy, maritime-influenced environment to clearer, drier, and more stable conditions, which may persist into the coming hours.
