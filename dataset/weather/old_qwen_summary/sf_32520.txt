Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures rose, suggesting the influence of a drying offshore wind pattern. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining slightly in the late afternoon—indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, fair conditions. Wind activity was subdued during the night with brief bursts of stronger winds in the early morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a notable shift toward onshore flow in the late evening. These patterns suggest the onset of a marine layer dissipation, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions later in the day.
