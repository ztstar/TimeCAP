Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold nighttime phase to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, peaking just before dawn, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure in the early morning hours suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with unsettled weather, followed by a slow recovery as the system moved out. Wind speeds increased steadily through the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, potentially leading to precipitation or cloudy conditions in the near term.
