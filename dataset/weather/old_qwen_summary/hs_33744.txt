Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a notable decline toward the end of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more northerly direction, accompanied by weakening wind speeds, hinting at a stabilization or weakening of surface inflow. These developments point to a dynamic atmospheric environment, potentially conducive to thunderstorms later in the day.
