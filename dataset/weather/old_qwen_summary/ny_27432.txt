Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking in the late evening, which suggests increasing moisture in the air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure dropped notably during the mid to late night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined indicators point to an evolving weather pattern that could lead to rain or storms in the near term, affecting daily activities and travel in New York City.
