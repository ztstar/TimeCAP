Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, peaking sharply before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or clearing of fog. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, followed by fluctuations that indicate passing weather systems, possibly associated with a weak front. Wind patterns revealed a shift from light to stronger gusts in the early morning and late evening, with changing wind directions indicating variable flow, possibly influenced by local topography. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period—likely from a marine-influenced, foggy regime toward a drier, more stable afternoon, with potential for clearer skies later in the day.
