Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warmer day. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, likely due to radiative cooling overnight. Air pressure showed a stable yet slightly fluctuating pattern, with a brief increase in the mid-afternoon, signaling possible subtle changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained low during the overnight hours, increasing significantly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, potentially indicating the influence of a developing surface boundary. These combined conditions suggest a high likelihood of lingering moisture and possible afternoon thunderstorm development, particularly as warming continues and moisture remains near saturation.
