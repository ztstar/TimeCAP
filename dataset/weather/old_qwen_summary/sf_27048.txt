Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining significantly, suggesting the influence of a marine layer that began to break up. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a sustained rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the subsequent approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were strongest in the late morning and early evening, with shifting wind directions suggesting dynamic airflow patterns, possibly linked to coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale influences. These conditions point to a typical coastal weather cycle, with cool, moist mornings transitioning into milder, drier afternoons—consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
