Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend overnight, followed by a steady warming period during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping sharply as temperatures climbed, indicating a transition from a damp, stable air mass to drier, warmer conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing and slightly rising, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, with increased wind speeds in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by the developing pressure gradient. These changes point to the arrival of a warm, dry air mass following a cold front, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
