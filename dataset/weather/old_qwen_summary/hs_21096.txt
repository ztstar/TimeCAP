Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for convective activity. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which enhances the feel of warmth and increases the likelihood of thunderstorms under unstable atmospheric conditions. A sustained drop in air pressure, especially in the final several hours, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a consistent northeasterly shift in direction, signaling the influence of a developing storm system. These combined trends indicate a high probability of afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the near term, with possible gusty winds and localized heavy rainfall.
