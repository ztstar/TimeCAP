Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the early morning hours, remained low through midday, then surged to saturation in the late night, suggesting the onset of a nocturnal cooling and condensation event. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, a notable spike around midnight, followed by a gradual decline, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds remained minimal during the early hours, picking up in the evening and persisting at moderate to strong levels overnight, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwest to more southerly and easterly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
