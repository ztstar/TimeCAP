Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels spiked dramatically in the overnight and early morning periods, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and a damp, oppressive feel before clearing later in the day. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or front through the area. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable and stronger winds in the afternoon, particularly from the northeast and east sectors, potentially signaling changing storm dynamics. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transitional weather regime, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
