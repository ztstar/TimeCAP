Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with positivity rates rising sharply in recent months, indicating widespread community transmission. Influenza A has consistently driven the increase in positivity, contributing the largest share of positive cases, particularly in the last 10 weeks, where its proportion has nearly doubled. Influenza B has also increased significantly but remains secondary in magnitude, with a steady rise in proportion that suggests co-circulation with Influenza A. The recent peak in positivity rates, followed by a notable decline, reflects the potential onset of a seasonal peak, possibly nearing its zenith. These trends underscore the need for heightened surveillance, public health messaging, and vaccination efforts to mitigate further spread and healthcare burden.
