Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, then dropped abruptly during the midday hours before rebounding slightly in the evening. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating an approaching low-pressure system, which may signal the potential for unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted notably during the night, with a change in direction from northeasterly to southerly and westerly, accompanied by a brief increase in wind speed, suggesting the influence of a developing weather front. These combined trends point to a dynamic atmospheric environment, with conditions conducive to possible thunderstorm development later in the day.
