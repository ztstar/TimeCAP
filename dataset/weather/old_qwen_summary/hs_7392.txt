Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then gradually declined, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, which may indicate an influx of warm, moist air. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds suggests a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, possibly conducive to afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
