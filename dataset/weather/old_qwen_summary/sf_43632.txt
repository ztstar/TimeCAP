Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds were weakest during the early morning hours and intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, pointing to changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a diurnal cycle typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with marine air intrusion overnight and subsidence warming during the day.
