Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Relative humidity reached near saturation levels during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting high moisture content in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to a persistent fog or mist. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and eventually northerly, signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
