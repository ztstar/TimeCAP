Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud formation that dissipated as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, signaling consistent high-pressure influence, which typically brings clear or partly cloudy conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, potentially signaling a change in synoptic conditions. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind from the southeast may indicate the onset of a more stable, drier period, possibly reducing fog frequency in the coming hours.
