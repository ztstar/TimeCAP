Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, including a drop during the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the changeable conditions. Wind speeds picked up notably in the afternoon and evening, with strong, gusty winds from the southeast and east, potentially enhancing coastal cooling and contributing to the development of fog. The combination of high humidity, falling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a strong likelihood of foggy conditions, particularly near the coast and in low-lying areas, which could impact visibility and travel.
