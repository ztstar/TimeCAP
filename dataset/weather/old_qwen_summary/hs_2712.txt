Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase likely due to stable air mass conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the night, culminating in a peak just before dawn, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating a change in airflow patterns possibly associated with a front. These combined trends suggest the influence of a passing frontal boundary, potentially leading to unstable conditions later in the day, with increased risk of isolated thunderstorms as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
