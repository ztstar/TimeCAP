Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature rise, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a warming trend likely driven by changing wind patterns and solar insolation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with periods of high moisture followed by sharp declines, indicating intermittent influence from marine air masses and inland drying. Air pressure dropped sharply in the early morning hours before stabilizing, which may have coincided with a passing front or low-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds increased notably during midday and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest to west sectors, consistent with onshore flow that often brings fog and cooler conditions. These combined factors suggest a dynamic weather transition, with potential for foggy conditions or shifting cloud cover in the coming hours.
