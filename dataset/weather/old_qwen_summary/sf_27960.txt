Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually recovering in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late morning and early evening, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with stronger southerly and westerly flows, likely driven by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients, before subsiding and shifting toward more easterly directions. The combination of high humidity, falling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a typical marine layer event, common in San Francisco, which may have led to foggy conditions and cooler coastal temperatures.
