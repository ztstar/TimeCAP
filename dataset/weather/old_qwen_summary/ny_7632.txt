Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the day, indicating a transition from a moist to drier air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely brought unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly northwest to more southerly and then to variable directions later in the day, consistent with the changing pressure dynamics. The return to higher pressures and a gradual increase in temperature toward the end of the period signal the arrival of a more stable, drier air mass, suggesting improving weather conditions.
