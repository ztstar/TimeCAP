Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the middle of the night before dropping dramatically in the morning, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by clearing conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating the influence of a low-pressure system that likely brought overcast skies and increased cloud cover. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with intermittent shifts in direction, suggesting weak synoptic forcing and stable atmospheric conditions. The combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and a brief spike in wind activity points to localized weather changes, possibly including fog formation and a gradual transition toward clearer skies as the system passed through.
