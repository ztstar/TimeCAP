Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the predawn hours, suggesting increased moisture availability likely due to marine layer development. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions to the region. Wind speeds remained generally low, with periods of calm, especially during the early morning, but a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and later east-southeast may indicate the influence of local topography or changing pressure gradients. Combined, these patterns point to the presence of a persistent marine layer that has since begun to break down, potentially leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
