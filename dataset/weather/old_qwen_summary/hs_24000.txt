Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature fluctuations. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in multiple periods, which likely contributed to fog formation and a muggy feel during early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then began a steady increase in the late morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift toward more southerly to westerly directions, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, possibly setting the stage for unsettled weather later in the day.
