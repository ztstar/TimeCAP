Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels surged significantly after midnight, remaining elevated throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend during the late night and early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that may stabilize conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning hours, with strong gusts from the west and southwest, likely contributing to the mixing of air and the dissipation of fog. The shift in wind direction toward the west and south in the final hours suggests a change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns.
