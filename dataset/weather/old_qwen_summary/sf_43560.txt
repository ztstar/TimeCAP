Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity but a slight drop in the early morning hours. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Together, these trends suggest a transition from cool, moist conditions to warmer, drier air, potentially signaling the arrival of a high-pressure influence that could bring clearer skies.
