Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, indicating a possible transition from fog or low cloud cover to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, which may indicate changing synoptic-scale flow. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cool, damp, and foggy period to a drier and more stable environment, typical of late autumn or early winter conditions in the region.
