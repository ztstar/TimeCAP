Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a boundary layer that trapped moisture overnight and allowed for drying during daytime heating. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a relatively high level before a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may indicate the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, potentially signaling the arrival of a cold front or a change in regional airflow. Combined with the drop in humidity and increasing wind, these conditions suggest a transition toward drier and more stable air, possibly reducing the likelihood of convective activity in the near term.
