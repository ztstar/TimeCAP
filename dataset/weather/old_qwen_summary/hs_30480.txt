Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with near-saturated conditions during early morning hours and a sharp decline through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing front or convective activity. Air pressure fluctuated, with a notable drop in the late night and early morning hours, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but increased in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in synoptic flow or the development of a local breeze system. These combined patterns suggest the possibility of unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as temperatures rise and moisture begins to reaccumulate.
