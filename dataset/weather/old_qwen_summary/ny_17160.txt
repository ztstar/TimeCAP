Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point rise followed by drying conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight increase in the mid-morning hours, followed by a gradual decline, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon with shifts in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, likely due to evolving local pressure gradients. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and shifting winds indicates a transition toward fairer conditions later in the day, though residual moisture may still pose a slight risk of morning fog or drizzle.
