Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region's coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the development of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s frequent marine layer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant weather system passing through, but a slight increase in the late afternoon may hint at clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift to more consistent easterly to southeasterly flows during the night, contributing to the influx of cool, moist air from the Pacific. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a prolonged marine layer event, likely resulting in foggy conditions that could persist into the next day.
