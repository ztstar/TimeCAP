Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased after a cool start, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels began high in the early morning, dropped significantly during midday, and surged again in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture influx or precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly from late afternoon onward, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low with brief fluctuations, but wind direction shifted dramatically, especially in the late evening, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, humid, and stable atmosphere to a drier and more stable one, likely leading to clearer skies and settled conditions in the coming hours.
