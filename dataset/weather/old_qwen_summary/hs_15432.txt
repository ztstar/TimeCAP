Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating high moisture content, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A significant rise in air pressure occurred during the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to southerly and then westerly, with increasing wind speeds in the afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a developing weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, dropping humidity, and shifting wind direction suggests a transition toward more settled, warmer conditions, but also potential for localized thunderstorms if instability increases.
