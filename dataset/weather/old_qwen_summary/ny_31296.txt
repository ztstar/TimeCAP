Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, contributing to a damp and foggy feel, before sharply decreasing as the day progressed, indicating clearing skies. Air pressure showed an initial rise followed by a sustained high, suggesting stable conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought dry, settled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with stronger gusts from the southeast to east, then diminished during the day, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, aligning with a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and stable high pressure points to improving conditions, with a likely transition to clearer, more comfortable weather in the coming hours.
