Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity remained near saturation during the early hours, suggesting near-constant cloud cover and potential for precipitation, with a notable decrease in moisture content later in the period. Air pressure showed a sharp rise after an initial increase, peaking before stabilizing at high levels, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong and gusty, coming from the northwest, but diminished over time, with wind direction shifting progressively toward the west and southwest, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined changes point to a transition from a cold, damp, and windy weather regime to a drier, calmer, and gradually warming environment, likely leading to improved visibility and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
