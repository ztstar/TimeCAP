Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the early morning hours, suggesting a drying trend, possibly linked to a shift in air mass or clearing skies. Air pressure rose steadily through the evening and into the night, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings more stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, peaking in the late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southeast and later a shift toward the southwest, suggesting changing synoptic influences. The combination of falling temperatures, decreasing humidity, rising pressure, and strong winds points to a transition toward more settled and potentially cooler conditions, reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
