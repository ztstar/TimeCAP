Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady upward trend, indicating a gradual warming pattern throughout the day. Humidity levels began at saturation and progressively declined, suggesting a drying trend in the lower atmosphere, which may have contributed to clearer skies later in the period. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained generally low during the early morning hours before intensifying in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to more northerly and westerly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. Taken together, these indicators suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
