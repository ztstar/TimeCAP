Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again toward the late afternoon. Humidity levels climbed sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low, with a notable calm period in the early morning hours, followed by a return to light winds, which likely contributed to the accumulation of moisture near the surface. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to more southerly and westerly sectors, particularly in the morning, aligns with typical marine layer dynamics, reinforcing the presence of coastal fog and cool, moist air.
