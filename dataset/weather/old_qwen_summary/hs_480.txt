Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation and remaining high through the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or overcast conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a notable increase midday, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to more variable and later westerly flow, potentially signaling the influence of a changing frontal system. These conditions together suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled atmosphere, with implications for afternoon thunderstorm development.
