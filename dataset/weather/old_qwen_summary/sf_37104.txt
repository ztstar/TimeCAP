Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels spiked significantly in the overnight period, particularly during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A sharp decrease in air pressure occurred around midday, coinciding with a marked increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, indicating a possible frontal passage. The sustained high wind speeds and fluctuating wind directions in the afternoon suggest dynamic atmospheric conditions, potentially linked to a coastal breeze or synoptic-scale weather system. Overall, the combination of cooling, high humidity, and unstable pressure and wind patterns signals a transition in weather that may bring overcast skies or light precipitation later in the day.
