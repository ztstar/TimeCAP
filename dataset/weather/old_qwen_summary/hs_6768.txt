Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south and southwest, consistent with a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, likely clearing any lingering cloud cover and improving overall conditions.
