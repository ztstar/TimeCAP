Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the nighttime hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a gradual decline toward late evening, with a notable drop just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a change in air mass flow. Together, these patterns suggest the end of a humid, stable period and the possible onset of more dynamic weather conditions, including potential for afternoon thunderstorms.
