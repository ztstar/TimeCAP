Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the daytime, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal inversion that trapped moisture followed by daytime drying. Air pressure showed a gradual increase throughout the day, stabilizing at a higher level, which points to the influence of a high-pressure system bringing relatively stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially conducive to clearing skies and reduced chances of precipitation later today.
