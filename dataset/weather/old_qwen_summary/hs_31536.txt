Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal boundary layer and possible moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the night and into the early morning, stabilizing later in the day—this may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, consistent with a developing or ongoing sea breeze circulation. The shift in wind direction from southeast to more easterly and southerly patterns during peak humidity hours implies moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico, increasing the likelihood of isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
