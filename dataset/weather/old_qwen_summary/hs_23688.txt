Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the mid-morning and then stabilizing at lower levels during the late night and early morning. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the day, reaching near saturation by early morning, which significantly increased the perceived discomfort and supported the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, but the slight dips coincided with increased wind activity and rising humidity. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the northeast toward the southeast, suggesting a developing low-level circulation. These conditions collectively suggest a high likelihood of overcast skies and a potential for isolated precipitation overnight, particularly given the saturated air and increasing wind shear.
