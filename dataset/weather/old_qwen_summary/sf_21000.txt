Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, which indicates the influence of a strong high-pressure system bringing clear and settled weather. Wind speeds diminished substantially during the night and early morning, with winds shifting from a northerly to a southerly direction, reflecting a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a drying trend and improving conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable daytime temperatures in the near term.
