Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures showing a consistent decline through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching near-saturation conditions during late night and early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased precipitation risk. Wind speeds intensified during the overnight and early morning hours, with a notable increase in gusts and a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, hinting at changing airflow patterns associated with a developing weather front. These combined conditions suggest a transition toward potentially unstable weather, increasing the chance of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the coming hours.
