Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the evening, indicating a shift in moisture content possibly linked to changing wind patterns. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level before dropping again in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds surged dramatically in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with strong, variable winds from the southwest and west, consistent with coastal upwelling or a sea breeze influence. These combined conditions point to a dynamic coastal weather regime, likely driven by marine layer development and diurnal temperature variations typical of the San Francisco microclimate.
