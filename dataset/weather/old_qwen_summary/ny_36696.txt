Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the morning, indicating a cold overnight period followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a period of fog or light precipitation that has since cleared. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, culminating in a significant rise in the late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds exhibited notable variability, with peak gusts occurring in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the northwest and west, consistent with a change in air mass. These indicators collectively point to the passage of a cold front, followed by clearing skies and more stable, cooler conditions in the coming hours.
