Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the overnight hours, indicating a drying trend associated with the cooling, before rebounding in the late evening and early morning. Air pressure rose sharply during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to a more southeasterly flow, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, dry, and stable air mass to a potentially more variable and less stable regime later in the day, which may influence fog formation and temperature fluctuations.
