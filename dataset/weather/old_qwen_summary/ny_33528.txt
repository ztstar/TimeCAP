Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, reducing visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished to near zero during the late night and early morning, suggesting stagnant air, which can trap moisture and pollutants. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly and then to easterly in the late afternoon signals a change in airflow, potentially indicating the approach of a new weather pattern.
