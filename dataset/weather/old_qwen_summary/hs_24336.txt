Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity reached saturation levels during the overnight period, indicating strong moisture accumulation, which likely contributed to the development of fog or low cloud cover. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have facilitated the moist, stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly during the night, with a change in direction from southerly to northerly in the early morning, possibly signaling a front or outflow boundary moving through the region. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable wind speeds suggests a high likelihood of continued unstable conditions, potentially leading to afternoon thunderstorms.
