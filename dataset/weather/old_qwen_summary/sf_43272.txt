Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog and condensation, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds showed intermittent bursts, particularly in the late night and early morning, with shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic local circulation patterns, possibly linked to coastal upwelling or thermal gradients. These combined factors point to a transition from a foggy, damp overnight period to a more stable, sunnier afternoon, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate behavior.
