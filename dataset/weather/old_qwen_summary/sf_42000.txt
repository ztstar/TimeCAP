Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of marine air intrusion typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and back, reflecting dynamic air flow patterns near the coast. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable weather, consistent with the onset of a dry, coastal high-pressure regime.
