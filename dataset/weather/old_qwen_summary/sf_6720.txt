Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the mid-to-late morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward more westerly and southwesterly flow, which often brings maritime air into the region. Together, these patterns point to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge, likely leading to improved visibility and drier conditions in the coming hours.
