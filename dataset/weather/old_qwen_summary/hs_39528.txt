Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained low during the day but surged significantly overnight, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the onset of condensation and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, followed by a steady rise, which may signal the passage of a weather front or the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light during the day but increased in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwest to southeast, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with possible implications for morning fog, developing stability, and a potential shift in air mass that could influence conditions in the coming hours.
