Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating significant moisture accumulation, likely due to fog formation, which diminished sharply as temperatures rose and winds increased. A notable drop in air pressure occurred midday, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which coincided with stronger winds and a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest. The wind speeds intensified significantly during the midday period, suggesting the influence of a coastal breeze or frontal passage, which contributed to the reduction in humidity and dispersion of fog. Overall, the data suggests a dynamic transition from a damp, cool, and stable nighttime regime to a drier, windier, and more variable daytime pattern, consistent with typical coastal weather fluctuations in the region.
