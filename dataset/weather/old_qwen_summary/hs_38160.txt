Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, dropping sharply in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from overnight moisture accumulation to drier conditions as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise toward midday, reflecting the influence of a modest high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing trend. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and southwest, potentially signaling a shift in air mass or the onset of a local convective event. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and increased wind activity may elevate the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
