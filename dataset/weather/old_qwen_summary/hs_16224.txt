Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nocturnal temperature drop followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure showed a consistent and gradual increase, reaching a peak in the late afternoon and then slightly declining, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift from southerly to more southeasterly and then easterly directions throughout the day, indicating a change in wind patterns likely driven by the approaching high-pressure system. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and supporting clear skies for the coming hours.
