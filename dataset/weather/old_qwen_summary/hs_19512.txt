Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained high overnight, gradually decreasing as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds remained moderate, with consistent northerly to northwesterly flow, contributing to the cooling effect and aiding in the dispersal of moisture. This combination of falling temperatures, decreasing humidity, rising pressure, and stable wind patterns points to a drying and cooling trend, likely signaling the approach of more stable, fair weather conditions.
