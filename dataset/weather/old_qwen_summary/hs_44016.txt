Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dew and reduced comfort levels. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, but a notable increase occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest the end of a moist, cool period and the potential for improved conditions with clearing skies and more stable air in the coming hours.
