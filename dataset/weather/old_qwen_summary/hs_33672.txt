Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moisture as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed minimal fluctuation, with a brief spike in the early morning, consistent with stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were low and variable, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then back to southeasterly, possibly reflecting changing local circulation patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, warming daytime regime, which may influence overnight fog dissipation and afternoon convection potential.
