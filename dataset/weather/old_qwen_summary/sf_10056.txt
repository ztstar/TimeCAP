Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning to decrease slightly in the late afternoon, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speed remained low and stable throughout most of the period, with a brief spike in the late afternoon, although wind direction shifted abruptly to the southeast before returning to its previous northerly flow. These conditions point to the arrival of a stable, dry high-pressure ridge, contributing to clear skies and mild temperatures, with a brief disruption possibly linked to localized surface heating or a minor air mass shift.
