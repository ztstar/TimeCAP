Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cool front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation before plummeting in the late morning, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the overnight period, reaching a low point before rebounding, which is consistent with the approach and departure of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the day, with a brief increase in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and eventually northerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a period of coastal fog and marine layer influence followed by a clearing trend, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potentially cooler and more variable conditions expected in the near term.
