Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in wind speed during the overnight hours, accompanied by calm conditions and variable wind directions, suggests a period of atmospheric stability. The pressure began to rise in the early morning, reaching a peak before declining slightly in the evening, indicating a passing front or shift in air mass. The return of stronger winds and a shift toward more southerly directions in the late afternoon suggests the arrival of a new air mass, potentially signaling a change in weather with increased moisture and the possibility of precipitation.
