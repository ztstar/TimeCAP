Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the overnight period, indicating strong moisture presence, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has helped maintain stable conditions. Wind speeds declined significantly during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to more southerly, consistent with a coastal breeze pattern. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind, and stable pressure points to persistent marine layer activity, which is typical of San Francisco’s microclimate and may lead to continued foggy conditions into the coming day.
