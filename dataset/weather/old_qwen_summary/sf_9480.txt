Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, remaining stable overall with slight drops in the late evening, suggesting a weak low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were uniformly low throughout the period, with wind direction shifting significantly during the night—transitioning from westerly to southerly and then easterly—indicating a change in local atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a lingering marine layer with limited mixing, which is typical for San Francisco’s coastal climate and may lead to continued overcast skies and cool temperatures into the coming day.
