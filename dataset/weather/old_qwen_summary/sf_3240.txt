Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is common in the San Francisco Bay Area during transitional seasons. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning before a slight decline in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds were low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly and then northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These conditions point to a likely foggy and cool morning, clearing into a mild, breezy afternoon, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns influenced by marine layer and topography.
