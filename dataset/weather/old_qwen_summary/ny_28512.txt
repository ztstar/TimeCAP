Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise, indicating a transition from a cold night to a gradually warming day. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the overnight period, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation, which may have impacted visibility. A sustained decline in air pressure, particularly in the early hours, points to the approach of a low-pressure system, likely responsible for the increasing cloud cover and precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southerly, consistent with the movement of a frontal system through the region. These combined patterns suggest an active weather front moving through New York City, bringing the potential for precipitation and unsettled conditions later in the day.
