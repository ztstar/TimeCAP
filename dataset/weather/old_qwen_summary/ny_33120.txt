Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature decline occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool night into a milder day. Humidity levels peaked in the late night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility during those hours. A notable drop in air pressure during the late afternoon and early evening signals the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unstable weather, including precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics and possible storm development. These combined factors point to an evolving weather pattern that could result in unsettled conditions, including rain or storms, later in the day.
