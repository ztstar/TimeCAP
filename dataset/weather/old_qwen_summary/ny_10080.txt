Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased steadily throughout the night and into the early morning, peaking in the final hours, indicating a growing moisture content in the air. Air pressure steadily declined, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined factors point to the likelihood of precipitation or cloudy conditions in the near term, with possible impacts on travel and outdoor activities in New York City.
