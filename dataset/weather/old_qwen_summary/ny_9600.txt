Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the passage of a strong low-pressure system through the region. This was accompanied by a sharp decline in temperature followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the influence of a cold front followed by a warming air mass. Humidity remained near saturation overnight, then rapidly decreased, coinciding with the arrival of drier air and increasing wind speeds. Wind direction shifted from southerly to predominantly southeasterly and then westerly, aligning with the storm’s movement and contributing to the transition in conditions. The combination of rapidly changing pressure, rising winds, and a marked temperature increase points to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing unstable conditions and potential for precipitation in the near term.
