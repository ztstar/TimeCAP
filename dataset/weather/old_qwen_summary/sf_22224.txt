Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively high overnight and early morning, then declined significantly during the day, suggesting a drying trend as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief drop in the middle of the day, indicating possible atmospheric instability or a passing weather front. Wind speeds increased notably during midday and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These patterns suggest a transition from coastal maritime influence to more inland or valley-like conditions, potentially setting the stage for a shift in local weather patterns overnight.
