Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation levels throughout the night and early morning, contributing to a damp and oppressive feel, before decreasing notably as the day progressed. A steady decline in air pressure was observed, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely influenced the shift in weather conditions. Wind speeds diminished overnight, reaching a minimum before increasing again in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly and then easterly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These indicators collectively suggest the passage of a frontal system, with potential for precipitation and unstable weather in the near term.
