Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend during the day, with temperatures peaking in the afternoon before stabilizing slightly in the evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which increases the perception of heat and may contribute to discomfort. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, indicating improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift from southerly to more easterly and then northerly flow, suggesting changes in local wind patterns possibly linked to the movement of a weather front. The combination of elevated humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind directions suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
