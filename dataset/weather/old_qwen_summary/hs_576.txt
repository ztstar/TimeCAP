Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a more dynamic daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation, particularly during the low-wind periods. A notable decline in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, signaling the approach of a weather disturbance or front. The cessation of wind at multiple points during the early morning hours, combined with near-saturation humidity, created ideal conditions for fog and reduced visibility. Overall, the data points to a high likelihood of precipitation or storm activity in the near future, especially given the pressure drop and wind shifts observed in the latter half of the day.
