Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking and remaining high through the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of marine layer conditions common to the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the mid-to-late morning, consistent with a high-pressure system influencing the area and contributing to generally stable weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with calm or light winds, but increased in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest to west sectors, likely driven by sea-breeze development. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind shifts, and a warming trend in the evening suggests a potential for fog dissipation in the afternoon and clearer skies later in the day.
