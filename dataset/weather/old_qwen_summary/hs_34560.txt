Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature recovery. Humidity remained near saturation levels throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of low-level moisture and potential for fog or drizzle, which diminished as temperatures rose and air became drier in the late afternoon. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, hinting at a developing low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more easterly and northeasterly, signaling a change in airflow likely associated with the approaching system. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
