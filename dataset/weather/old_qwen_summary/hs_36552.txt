Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which indicates favorable conditions for fog formation or mist, particularly during the overnight period. A consistent drop in air pressure suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with unsettled weather and increasing chances of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to northerly and easterly directions, with gusts intensifying in the late morning and evening, signaling a possible frontal passage. These combined factors point to the development of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
