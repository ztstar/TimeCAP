Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that contributed to a thick, damp atmosphere. Temperature remained relatively stable with a slight overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual increase during the afternoon, suggesting limited diurnal variation typical of coastal fog influence. Air pressure steadily rose, reflecting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing flow patterns, likely due to local topography and thermal effects. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer influence, with fog and low clouds likely prevalent, especially during early morning hours, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic coastal climate.
