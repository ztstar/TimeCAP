Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system through the region. Temperature trends show a cooling phase in the early hours, peaking in the afternoon, which aligns with the influence of a frontal system and subsequent warming as the system moved out. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, particularly around the time of the pressure minimum, suggesting moisture influx associated with the storm system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with the storm's movement and changing pressure gradients. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing unsettled conditions, with potential for lingering showers or instability into the early part of the next day.
