Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the day, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity remained near saturation overnight before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of moisture associated with a recent storm system. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, peaking before stabilizing, which aligns with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to stronger, sustained flow from the southwest to west, likely driven by the high-pressure influence and contributing to the clearing skies. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a wet, unstable regime to a drier, more stable environment, with improved conditions expected in the immediate future.
