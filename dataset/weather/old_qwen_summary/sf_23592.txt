Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and remaining at maximum throughout the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds consistent with the region’s microclimate. A sustained period of high pressure dominated the middle of the day, but a notable drop in air pressure occurred toward the end of the observation window, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained low and steady throughout most of the day, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south-southeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These indicators collectively point to a transition period, with lingering marine layer effects giving way to potential coastal weather changes, possibly including increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
