Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, with the coolest readings occurring in the early morning hours, indicating a prolonged period of nighttime cooling. Humidity remained consistently near saturation, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a high likelihood of fog or mist, especially during the early morning. Air pressure showed a gradual rise followed by a slight fluctuation, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions, although minor variations suggest some atmospheric instability. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast and back, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the influence of localized convection. These combined factors suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate beneath a weakening inversion layer.
