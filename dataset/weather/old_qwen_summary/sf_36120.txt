Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, consistent with the influence of offshore flow and local topography. These conditions collectively suggest a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with the potential for changing conditions overnight.
