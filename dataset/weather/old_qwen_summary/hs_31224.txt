Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant warming trend likely driven by increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, especially in the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system capable of triggering convective activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and westerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined trends suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day, with potential for heavy rainfall and gusty winds.
