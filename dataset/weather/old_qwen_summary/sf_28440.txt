Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking near saturation, particularly during the overnight period, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent increase, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, moist, and foggy period to a drier, more stable, and breezy environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
