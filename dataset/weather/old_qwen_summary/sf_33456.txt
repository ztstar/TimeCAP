Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night, reaching a low point just before dawn, then rose significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds remained moderate during the night and early morning, increased in the late afternoon, and then decreased again toward evening, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and eventually westerly, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns. These changes point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing clearer, drier conditions in the coming hours as high pressure consolidates over the region.
