Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely associated with nighttime radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from saturated air to drier conditions amid clearing skies. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a high level, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system bringing fair conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with notable increases in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the west to northwest, implying a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from cooler, moist conditions to warmer, drier air under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge, likely leading to clear skies and stable weather in the near term.
