Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and low clouds. Air pressure showed a slight rising trend, particularly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies later. Wind speeds remained generally light, with minimal variation, though a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly during the evening suggests changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions point to a transition period where marine layer influence is still dominant, but a gradual clearing is expected as high pressure consolidates.
