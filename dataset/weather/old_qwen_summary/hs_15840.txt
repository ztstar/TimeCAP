Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking above 95% and remaining elevated, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, especially during the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased, culminating in a strong high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and contributed to stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief intensifications and shifting directions, particularly from the southeast and southwest, which may have facilitated localized moisture transport. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a transition from a damp, settled night toward clearer, more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
