Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before dropping sharply as temperatures climbed, indicating a transition from a stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, changing from a consistent easterly flow to a southerly and then westerly direction, likely signaling a change in airflow due to evolving pressure gradients. These indicators collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, which may lead to improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
