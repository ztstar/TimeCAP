Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift from a cooler nocturnal period to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation before declining through the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation early in the cycle. A steady decline in air pressure was observed throughout the night and into the early morning, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or approaching frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably during mid-morning and again in the late afternoon, with directional changes indicating a shift in local wind patterns, possibly due to surface heating or synoptic-scale forcing. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather transition, with potential for convective activity later in the day, particularly given the residual moisture and changing pressure dynamics.
