Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with brief bursts of moderate winds in the early morning and late evening, primarily from the southwest and west sectors, consistent with coastal breezes. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to a drier, more stable environment likely improving visibility and comfort levels.
