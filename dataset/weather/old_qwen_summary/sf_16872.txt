Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation (100%) during the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with near-zero values at one point, suggesting calm conditions conducive to fog formation. Wind direction remained predominantly from the southwest to west-southwest, consistent with marine influence, reinforcing the presence of coastal fog and the moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean.
