Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, though a brief dip occurred mid-morning before rebounding. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with only light to calm conditions, but shifted slightly in direction and intensity during the late afternoon, possibly signaling changing airflow patterns. These trends collectively suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, which may lead to clearer skies and reduced fog in the coming hours.
