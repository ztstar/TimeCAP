Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation during the early hours, indicating high moisture content, which then declined significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds picked up in the late afternoon and remained strong through the evening, with winds shifting from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a transition in airflow patterns. This combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests the arrival of drier, more stable air, likely marking the end of a period of damp, stagnant conditions.
