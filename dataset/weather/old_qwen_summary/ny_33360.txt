Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a high before declining slightly in the afternoon, consistent with the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns collectively point to the influence of a passing frontal system, with cooler, drier, and windier conditions prevailing by late evening, likely leading to clearer skies and improved air quality in the coming hours.
