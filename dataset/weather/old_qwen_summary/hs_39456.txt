Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-range, which suggests the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds were generally low overnight but intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the west and southwest, potentially bringing drier air and clearing skies. These combined factors point to a shift from a humid, stable night to a warmer, drier, and gradually clearing day ahead.
