Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating increasing daytime solar heating and potential instability in the lower atmosphere. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking at saturation levels, which enhances the risk of thunderstorm development as the air becomes increasingly moist and unstable. Air pressure showed a steady decline, especially in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter part of the day, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the east-southeast, typical of a developing storm system drawing in moist air. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, with potential for localized flooding given the saturated conditions and weakening pressure.
