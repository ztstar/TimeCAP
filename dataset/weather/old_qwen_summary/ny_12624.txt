Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool nocturnal phase to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture in the atmosphere and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, particularly after midnight, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These combined trends point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and possibly stronger winds in the near term.
