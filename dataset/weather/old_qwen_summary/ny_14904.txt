Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more favorable conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting nighttime moisture accumulation, followed by a sharp decline as the day progressed, which may have contributed to clearer skies. Air pressure showed sustained high values throughout most of the period, except for a notable drop in the mid-afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally low except for a brief surge in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, hinting at changing airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from cooler, more humid conditions to warmer, drier air, likely leading to improved daytime weather with reduced chances of precipitation.
