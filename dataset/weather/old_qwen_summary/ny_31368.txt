Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative cooling and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours, which suggests the potential for fog formation and reduced visibility during the night and early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions and precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to more easterly and northeasterly directions, with increasing wind speeds during the early morning, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors point toward a transition period in the weather, with possible lingering effects such as overcast skies, drizzle, or light precipitation as the system moves through the region.
