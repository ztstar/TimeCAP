Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased during the afternoon and early evening, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to cool, suggesting a diurnal heating pattern influenced by cloud cover and moisture. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, with a notable spike in the evening, contributing to a muggy and oppressive feel. Wind speeds were low during the early morning hours but intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northwesterly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to the development of a potentially stormy weather scenario, particularly during the overnight hours, with increased risk of thunderstorms due to the convergence of moisture, instability, and wind shear.
