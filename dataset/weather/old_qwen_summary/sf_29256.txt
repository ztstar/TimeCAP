Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, peaking during the early morning hours and plummeting in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure fluctuated widely, with a pronounced drop followed by a sharp rise, indicating the passage of a frontal system that likely brought the cooler, moister conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night and early morning, with strong southerly and easterly flows preceding the temperature drop, while winds calmed later in the day. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic weather pattern, likely driven by coastal upwelling and frontal activity, which has led to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, drier air in the afternoon.
