Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, which may signal the influence of a developing weather system approaching from the west. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions and variable directions, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northeast and southeast, likely due to local topographic effects and pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition from a stable, fog-prone night to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for changing conditions later in the day.
