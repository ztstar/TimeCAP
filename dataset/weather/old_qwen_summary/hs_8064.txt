Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the early morning and remaining high, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly during the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a different air mass. These combined indicators suggest a drying trend with increasing stability, potentially leading to clear skies and comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
