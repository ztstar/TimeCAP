Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of a warming air mass. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight and early morning periods, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a passing frontal system. Air pressure showed a notable decrease during the night, followed by a gradual recovery, which is typical of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, with stronger winds from the south and southwest, likely contributing to the mixing of air and the dissipation of fog. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing winds suggests a transition toward drier and more stable conditions later in the day.
