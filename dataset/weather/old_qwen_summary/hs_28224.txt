Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop before stabilizing, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southeast, consistent with a developing or passing storm system. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly and then to more northerly patterns supports the movement of a frontal system through the region, raising the potential for thunderstorms or brief showers in the near term.
