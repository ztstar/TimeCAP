Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before warming significantly during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a sharp increase overnight followed by a sharp drop during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden front and subsequent clearing. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, pointing to the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the day but increased in the early evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which may signal changing weather patterns or frontal passage. Combined, these trends suggest that New York City experienced a transition from stable, humid conditions to a developing storm system, with potential for precipitation and cooler temperatures in the near term.
