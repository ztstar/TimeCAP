Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with frequent readings at or near saturation, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a high potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure dropped significantly, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These conditions collectively indicate a transition toward more unstable and potentially storm-prone weather, with elevated risks of rainfall and reduced visibility.
