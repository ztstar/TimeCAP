Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, contributing to a damp, muggy feel, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon as air warmed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late morning and again in the evening, indicating possible storm development or passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by shifting wind directions suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the weather, potentially leading to unsettled conditions, including possible showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
