Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant and sustained drop in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Temperature remained near freezing for most of the day before a sharp rise in the late afternoon, suggesting a warming trend possibly linked to an advancing front. Humidity levels stayed consistently high, with a notable spike mid-day, contributing to a damp and muggy feel, which may have enhanced precipitation likelihood. Wind speeds were initially moderate, then decreased significantly, only to surge sharply in the final hour, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, signaling a change in weather patterns. These combined indicators point to an active weather system moving through the region, increasing the probability of precipitation and potentially strong gusts in the near term.
