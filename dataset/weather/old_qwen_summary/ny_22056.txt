Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decrease during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining significantly during the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing trend. Air pressure remained stable with slight fluctuations, with a brief rise in the midday hours suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a consistent direction shifting gradually from the northeast to the east and southeast, which may indicate a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest the possibility of improving conditions with reduced dampness and more stable air, potentially leading to clearer skies later in the day.
