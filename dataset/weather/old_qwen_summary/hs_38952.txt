Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp rise during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating possible atmospheric instability, followed by a recovery and slight increase later in the day. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, suggesting the influence of a shifting pressure gradient. Combined with high humidity and elevated wind activity, these conditions may have contributed to a heightened risk of localized thunderstorms or heavy showers during the late evening hours.
