Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift from marine influence to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds showed strong variability, with sustained gusts in the late night and early morning, particularly from the northwest and west, aligning with typical coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. The combination of these factors points to a transition from a foggy, damp morning to a relatively dry, stable afternoon, consistent with the typical diurnal pattern of the San Francisco Bay Area.
