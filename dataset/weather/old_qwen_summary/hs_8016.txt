Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining steadily into the afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that began to dissipate as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds decreased slightly in the early hours, remained low through midday, and then increased slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southeast to southwest, indicating a possible change in air mass flow. Taken together, these trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, warming daytime pattern, with potential for changing conditions later in the day.
