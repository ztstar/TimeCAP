Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the overnight period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, with a brief drop during the early morning hours, potentially signaling the passage of a weak front. The combination of high humidity, strong winds, and cooling temperatures points to a marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, which likely brought foggy and cool conditions to much of the city.
