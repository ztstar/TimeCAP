Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase throughout the day, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal boundary layer to increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds and reduced visibility during those hours. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the mid-to-late morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which generally brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from late afternoon into evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, signaling a change in airflow likely tied to a developing synoptic-scale pattern. These conditions together suggest the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially setting the stage for a warm and sunny day ahead, though lingering moisture may result in afternoon thunderstorms if instability builds later.
