Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and into the early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then easterly, indicating a change in airflow likely tied to a frontal passage or local circulation shift. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and falling humidity in the late afternoon suggests improving weather conditions, with a higher likelihood of clearing skies and more comfortable daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
