Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late morning and stabilizing, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds declined steadily throughout the day, with winds shifting from a northwest to a more north-northeast direction, aligning with the development of a stable atmospheric regime. These conditions collectively point to a lingering marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s climate, with potential for continued foggy mornings and mild, stable conditions in the coming hours.
