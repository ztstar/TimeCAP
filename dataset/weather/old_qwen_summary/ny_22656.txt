Temperatures exhibited a sharp drop during the early morning hours, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal pattern likely driven by changing solar insolation and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels were low during the day, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through the night, suggesting possible nocturnal cooling and moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the morning and into the early afternoon, culminating in a notable spike that may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, implying a change in air mass and potential for warmer, moister inflow. Overall, the data suggests a transition from cooler, drier conditions to a warmer, more humid regime, likely resulting in partly cloudy to overcast skies with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
