Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal cooling and inland heating. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, followed by a dramatic increase in the late evening, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air, possibly from marine influence or a developing fog event. Air pressure remained relatively stable until late evening, when a notable drop occurred, signaling the potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning and again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass patterns, including onshore flow during the night. These combined indicators suggest the city is transitioning into a period of potentially unstable and wetter conditions, with a heightened chance of fog, drizzle, or light precipitation later in the night.
