Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City declined steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a possible transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline throughout the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing and slightly rising in the late afternoon, consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and early night, particularly from the southwest and south, suggesting strong inflow from a storm system, with gusts reaching peak strength in the late evening. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind, and high humidity points to dynamic weather conditions, likely bringing precipitation or unstable air, which may result in rain or storms later in the day.
