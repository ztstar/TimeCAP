Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the coldest part of the night. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, then sharply increased in the early hours before beginning to fall, signaling the passage of a strong high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours, shifting from a northwest to a more southerly direction, with sustained winds from the southwest in the late morning to early afternoon, likely driven by the transitioning pressure gradient. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to an imminent change in weather, with a likely increase in cloud cover and potential for precipitation later in the day.
