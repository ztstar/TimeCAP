Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a clear nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable but with slight fluctuations, hinting at minor atmospheric changes without a major weather system passing through. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, with a marked surge in the final hours, driven by stronger northerly to easterly flow, which could signal a shift in regional airflow. These combined patterns suggest the city experienced a transition from a cool, moist, and stable evening into a drier, breezier afternoon, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
