Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a change in air mass, possibly bringing drier conditions. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds in the evening points to improving weather conditions and a potential decrease in the likelihood of precipitation.
