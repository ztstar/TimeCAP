Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and shifting air masses. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, remaining elevated through mid-morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass or frontal passage. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with a brief low-pressure dip followed by a sustained period of moderate to high pressure, hinting at a dynamic weather system passing through. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, including strong southerly and easterly flows that may indicate the approach of a moisture-laden air mass. Collectively, these trends suggest the potential for unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
