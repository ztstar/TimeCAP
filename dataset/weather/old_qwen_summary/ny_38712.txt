Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours but surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking and staying elevated before sharply dropping later in the day, suggesting a possible passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds were moderately high overnight and during the early morning, with consistent directional shifts indicating dynamic airflow, particularly from the northwest and west sectors. The combination of rising pressure, falling humidity, and decreasing winds points toward improving weather conditions, with clearer skies and more stable atmospheric conditions expected in the coming hours.
