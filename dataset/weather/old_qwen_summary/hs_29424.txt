Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cool overnight conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with sharp drops during midday and a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting possible nocturnal moisture accumulation and daytime drying. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, peaking before declining through the afternoon, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds remained low through the early hours but intensified in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeasterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially leading to improved air quality and clearer conditions in the coming hours.
