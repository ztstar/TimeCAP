Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a transition from a dry to a more humid air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, particularly from the south and southeast, before moderating and shifting direction toward the west and northwest in the late afternoon. These patterns suggest a developing high-pressure ridge over the region, likely leading to calm, warm, and potentially hazy conditions in the coming hours.
