Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the afternoon and early evening, indicating the onset of a warming trend likely driven by shifting air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a notable spike in the early morning hours, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation, followed by a sharp decline as conditions dried out. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds showed extreme variability, with a strong burst in the midday hours followed by near-calm conditions later, indicating a transient disturbance that has since dissipated. The wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly over time, consistent with the passage of a front and the establishment of more northerly flow under the high-pressure influence.
