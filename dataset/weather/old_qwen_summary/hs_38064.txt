Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the late morning and early afternoon, which may have contributed to a more oppressive feel despite the cooler temperatures. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which could signal potential for storm development later. Wind patterns shifted from northerly to more easterly and southerly directions, with sustained winds increasing in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal boundary. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and shifting wind direction points to an elevated risk of thunderstorms in the near term.
