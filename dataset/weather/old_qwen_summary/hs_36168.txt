Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked and remained near saturation during the early hours, indicating potential for fog or drizzle, which likely contributed to the temperature plateau and reduced visibility. A steady drop in atmospheric pressure during the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring continued unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southwest, signaling the influence of a developing wind shift consistent with a frontal passage. Combined, these factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with elevated moisture and shifting winds increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
