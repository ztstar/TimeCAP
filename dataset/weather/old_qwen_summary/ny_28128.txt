Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the mid-to-late morning before rising again in the evening, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, which often signals the approach of a high-pressure system and improving weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and westerly sectors, indicating a change in airflow likely associated with a cold front. These combined trends point to a transitioning weather pattern, with colder, drier air moving in and potential for clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
