Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged to near saturation overnight, remaining elevated through the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a stable, damp air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable through the night, then declined slightly in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system or a shift in airflow patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then easterly, indicating changing circulation patterns possibly linked to a frontal boundary. These combined trends suggest the potential for developing afternoon thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air accumulates during the afternoon hours.
