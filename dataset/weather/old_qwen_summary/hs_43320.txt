Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with sustained high values during the night and early morning, suggesting condensation and possible fog formation, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, indicating the passage of a weather front or disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal system. Combined with shifting wind directions and rising humidity, these patterns suggest a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
