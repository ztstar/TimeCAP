Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity remained elevated through the early hours, peaking during the night before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting a transition from damp conditions to drier air. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the later morning, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with a developing frontal influence. Combined, these trends suggest that a storm system passed through the area, bringing cooler, drier air and increasing wind, potentially leading to changing conditions in the coming hours.
