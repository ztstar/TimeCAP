Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels started high and steadily decreased, indicating a drying trend as the day progressed, which may have contributed to increased comfort despite the cooler air. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system approaching the region, which typically brings stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours and remained consistently strong through midday, with wind direction shifting significantly, suggesting dynamic circulation changes associated with the approaching high-pressure front. The combination of falling temperatures, decreasing humidity, rising pressure, and persistent winds points to a transition toward drier and more stable weather, likely reducing the chance of precipitation in the near term.
