Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend during the early morning, followed by a gradual cooling into the late evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a likely influx of drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no clear signs of a passing front, which implies a stable atmospheric regime. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, particularly during the late night and early morning, with a shift from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly directions, potentially signaling a change in local circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable evening environment to a drier, more dynamic morning, with possible implications for fog dissipation and localized convective activity later in the day.
