Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to a damp and foggy atmosphere, particularly before dawn. A sustained drop in air pressure throughout the night and early morning indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with deteriorating weather conditions and potential precipitation. Wind patterns shifted dramatically during the night, with a surge in speed and directional variability, hinting at the influence of a frontal system passing through the region. These combined factors suggest that New York City is currently under the influence of a developing storm system, increasing the likelihood of rain or showers in the near term.
