Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition toward a more stable atmospheric condition. Humidity levels remained consistently high, frequently reaching saturation, which contributed to a persistent damp feel and increased likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, then began to recover, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with strong gusts during the early morning and late evening, driven by shifting wind directions that rotated from easterly to northerly, signaling dynamic pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a period of stormy conditions that has begun to subside, with clearing skies and improving stability expected in the coming hours.
