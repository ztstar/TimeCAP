Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period into a slightly warmer phase. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the night. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the south-southeast, suggesting the influence of a passing low-pressure system. The strongest winds were observed in the late afternoon and early evening, with sustained gusts from the south-southeast, which may have enhanced coastal mixing and contributed to the dissipation of fog. These patterns collectively point to a dynamic weather shift, likely bringing variable conditions with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day.
