Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from nighttime to daytime conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to stable air and radiative cooling. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, with a brief dip in the early morning before rising again, reflecting the passage of a high-pressure system that stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds remained generally low until late afternoon, when a significant increase occurred, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the approach of a developing weather system, potentially bringing increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term.
