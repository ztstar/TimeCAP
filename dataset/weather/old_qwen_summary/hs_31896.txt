Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight temperature drop. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, contributing to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a developing weather system. Wind speeds were subdued during the early hours but increased noticeably in the late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass dynamics, possibly from a southerly to a more easterly flow. These combined factors—high humidity, temperature fluctuations, and shifting wind patterns—indicate an environment ripe for unstable conditions, with a heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
