Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, indicating a strong cooling trend, likely due to the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, with a sharp decline during midday followed by a surge to near saturation in the late evening, signaling the arrival of moist air, possibly associated with precipitation. Air pressure spiked sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to stabilizing conditions before a subsequent low-pressure shift. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with frontal passage and potential storm development. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather transition, with a possible increase in storm activity and cooler, more unstable conditions in the near term.
