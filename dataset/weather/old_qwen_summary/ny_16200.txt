Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising again by late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before beginning to decrease as temperatures climbed. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, culminating in a sharp jump in the late evening, indicating the approach of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the overnight hours, with a notable increase in the afternoon and early evening, suggesting the onset of more dynamic atmospheric conditions. The shift in wind direction from predominantly northerly and westerly to more variable and southerly patterns may signal a transition in air mass, potentially bringing milder conditions.
