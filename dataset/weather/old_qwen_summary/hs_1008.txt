Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by a daytime rebound. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in the early hours, then sharply declined during midday, likely due to increasing solar heating and wind activity. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and into the early morning, reaching a peak before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted markedly, with strong northerly and easterly winds arriving in the late night and early morning, possibly signaling the passage of a cold front, followed by more variable and generally weaker winds during the day. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, unstable nocturnal environment to a drier, more settled daytime regime, potentially reducing the risk of thunderstorms but increasing heat retention during the late afternoon.
