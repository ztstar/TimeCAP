Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, coinciding with a marked drop in temperature, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, suggesting active atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and then to the southeast points to a developing frontal passage, which could result in precipitation or storms in the near term.
