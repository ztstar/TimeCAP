- Humidity (%): Humidity levels remained relatively stable in the early hours before a gradual increase began, accelerating significantly during the latter half of the period. A pronounced surge in humidity occurred in the final several hours, culminating in near-saturation conditions, which may indicate approaching precipitation or a shift in air mass. This rapid rise suggests increasing moisture accumulation, potentially signaling deteriorating weather conditions or heightened risk of fog formation.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has shown a steady upward trend over the past 24 hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. The sustained period of elevated pressure followed by a gradual decline suggests a possible transition phase, potentially signaling changing weather patterns. This behavior typically correlates with improving weather conditions initially, but the recent weakening may foreshadow an approaching disturbance or low-pressure development.
- Temperature (Kelvin): Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a sharp increase during midday, peaking in the afternoon before gradually cooling again. The most significant anomaly occurred mid-afternoon, where a sudden and pronounced rise was followed by a rapid reversal, suggesting possible localized heat accumulation or a measurement fluctuation. This pattern indicates dynamic thermal behavior, likely influenced by diurnal cycles and urban heat effects, with implications for energy demand and public comfort.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speeds remained consistently low during the initial portion of the 24-hour period, with multiple hours recording minimal or no measurable wind, suggesting a calm atmospheric condition. A gradual increase in wind activity emerged in the latter half, peaking around the final few hours, indicating a developing breeze or possibly a shift in local meteorological patterns. The sustained rise and variability toward the end may signify the approach of a weather system, warranting attention for potential impacts on outdoor activities and air quality dispersion.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a shift from predominantly westerly and southwesterly patterns early in the period to a strong transition toward easterly and southeasterly flows in the latter half. A notable stabilization near the northern quadrant occurred mid-period, followed by a consistent clockwise rotation toward the northeast, suggesting a possible change in large-scale pressure gradients. The sustained presence of values near the northern and eastern sectors in the final hours indicates potential influence from a developing frontal system or localized circulation shift.
