Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回升 through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooling overnight and warming during daylight. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply decreasing during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and improved weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with the approach of a developing weather front. Combined, these trends point to a shift toward drier, more stable, and potentially clearer conditions in the city, with a favorable outlook for the coming hours.
