Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels peaked in the early evening, contributing to a noticeable increase in fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the late night and early morning. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, followed by a brief spike, indicating the passage of a weather front that likely brought gusty winds and shifting conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening, with strong, consistent gusts from the west and southwest, suggesting the influence of coastal upwelling or a developing sea breeze. The combination of low pressure, rising wind speeds, and fluctuating humidity points to an active marine layer dynamics, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, likely resulting in foggy mornings and cool, breezy afternoons.
