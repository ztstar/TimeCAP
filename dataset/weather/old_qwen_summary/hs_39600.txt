Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass dynamics. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, with a notable drop around dawn, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
