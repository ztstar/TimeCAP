Over the past 24 hours, a gradual cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining through the night. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a peak before falling sharply in the late afternoon, indicating potential moisture release or a shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the day, particularly in the evening and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable lull in the midday hours, followed by a reactivation in the late evening, often from variable directions including the northeast and northwest. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly directions hints at a change in atmospheric circulation, likely associated with the passage of a weather front, which could bring unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
