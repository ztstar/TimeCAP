Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure remained nearly constant until the final hours, when a slight drop occurred, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally low and variable during the night, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with wind directions shifting from westerly to more southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period influenced by coastal fog dynamics and the potential for developing breezy, cooler conditions later in the day.
