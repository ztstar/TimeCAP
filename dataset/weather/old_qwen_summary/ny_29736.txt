Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant overnight cooling event. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture, culminating in near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to foggy or overcast conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, with a strong shift in wind direction suggesting a change in air mass, possibly from the northeast or east. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and potentially foggy night toward a drier and more stable morning, with improving visibility and conditions later in the day.
