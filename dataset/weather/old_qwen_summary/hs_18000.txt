Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before showing a slight upward trend in the morning, signaling the possible influence of a high-pressure system approaching. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly wind directions, which may indicate the onset of a sea breeze or approaching weather front. Combined with rising humidity and moderate wind, these conditions could increase the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
