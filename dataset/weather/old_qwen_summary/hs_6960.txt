Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. A sudden increase in atmospheric pressure around midday, followed by a gradual decline, points to the passage of a high-pressure system that has since weakened, potentially allowing for increased convective activity. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon before diminishing toward evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southerly and eventually to a more westerly flow, which may indicate changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest that Houston is transitioning into a period of increasing afternoon instability, raising the likelihood of localized thunderstorms, particularly given the drying trend and warming afternoon temperatures.
