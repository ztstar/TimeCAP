Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a consistent trend of high humidity levels, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating a saturated atmosphere that likely contributed to the formation of fog or dew. Temperature remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual increase during the afternoon, suggesting the onset of daytime heating. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the evening and into the early morning, followed by a slight recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction toward the southwest, indicating a change in air mass and potential for storm development. These combined conditions—high humidity, falling pressure, increasing wind, and shifting wind direction—suggest a heightened risk of thunderstorms, especially during the late afternoon and evening hours.
