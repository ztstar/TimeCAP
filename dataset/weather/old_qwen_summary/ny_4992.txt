Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained low during the morning and early afternoon, then increased slightly in the evening, suggesting a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, followed by a noticeable drop—indicating the approach of a low-pressure system.
