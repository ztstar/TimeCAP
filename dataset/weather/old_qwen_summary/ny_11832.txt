Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady rise, indicating the onset of a warming trend likely driven by shifting air masses. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning and late night hours, dropping significantly in the midday and afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning before gradually declining, which may indicate the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure area. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and west, potentially bringing in warmer, moister air and increasing the likelihood of precipitation later. The change in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more southerly and southeasterly suggests an approaching storm system, which could bring unsettled weather conditions in the coming hours.
