Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely driven by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning hours, decreasing sharply in the afternoon, which aligns with the dissipation of fog and increased air mixing. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred, with strong southerly and westerly winds in the early evening giving way to more variable, often easterly flows later, suggesting changes in synoptic-scale pressure gradients. Air pressure exhibited a peak in the late morning and early afternoon before a sharp decline in the evening, followed by a recovery late at night—indicative of a passing weather system or frontal passage. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind speeds late in the period suggests a transition toward clearer, drier conditions, potentially signaling the end of a foggy, cool phase typical of the region’s microclimate.
