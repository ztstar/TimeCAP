Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, hinting at the approach of a frontal boundary or a developing sea breeze. These combined patterns suggest the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms, particularly if daytime heating amplifies convective activity.
