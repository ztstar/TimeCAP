Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the early morning, suggesting a period of dry air intrusion, likely due to offshore winds, before rising significantly in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and increased moisture. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking midday, which suggests the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, contributing to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, with a strong shift toward the southwest, indicating a strengthening onshore flow that may bring cooler, moister air from the Pacific. The combination of rising humidity, increasing wind speed, and a shift in wind direction suggests that the city may be entering a period of enhanced marine layer activity, potentially leading to fog and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
