Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region during this time of year. Air pressure remained nearly constant, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with no significant weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of calm and minor shifts in wind direction, particularly in the afternoon and evening, which may have influenced localized fog dispersion. The combination of high humidity, low wind, and temperature inversion patterns strongly supports persistent fog and cool conditions, especially around the coastal and low-lying areas.
