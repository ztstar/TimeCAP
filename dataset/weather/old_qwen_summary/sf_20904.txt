Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may have brought moist conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with calm periods around dawn and shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to marine layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds points to a strong marine influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, and may signal continued overcast or foggy conditions in the near term.
