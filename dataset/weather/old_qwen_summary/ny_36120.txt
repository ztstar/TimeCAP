Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, indicating a pronounced cooling trend, likely due to the arrival of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to northeasterly and then to westerly directions, with increasing speeds, reflecting dynamic atmospheric changes associated with frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition toward stormy conditions, with the potential for rain or showers in the immediate hours ahead.
