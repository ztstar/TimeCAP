Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature decline. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred mid-morning, with wind speed increasing and direction transitioning from westerly to southerly and then easterly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. Air pressure showed a complex pattern, with a sharp rise followed by a sustained drop, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front. These combined dynamics point to a coastal fog event driven by marine air intrusion, followed by a shift toward more variable and potentially windy conditions as the day progressed.
