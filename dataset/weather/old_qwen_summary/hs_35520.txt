Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels declined significantly during the midday and afternoon, indicating a drying trend, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions despite rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the early and mid-day, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to stabilize, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds decreased toward the end of the period, with a shift in wind direction from more northerly to easterly, implying a change in airflow patterns that could signal the approach of a new air mass. Overall, the data indicates a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
