Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s maritime climate. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with coastal fog patterns. Air pressure remained stable through the night before increasing slightly in the afternoon, signaling a possible shift toward more stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained light throughout most of the period, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, though a shift toward a more easterly direction in the late evening may reflect changing synoptic influences. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to foggy conditions overnight and a cool, damp feel during the morning hours.
