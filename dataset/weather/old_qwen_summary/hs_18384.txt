Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining into the early morning hours, suggesting a transition from daytime heating to nighttime radiative cooling. Relative humidity remained consistently high throughout the day, particularly during nighttime hours, indicating saturated air conditions that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline, especially in the final hours, which is often associated with an approaching low-pressure system or storm front. Wind speeds decreased significantly toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly, signaling a possible change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest the potential for precipitation or unstable weather conditions in the near term, warranting attention for residents and local authorities.
