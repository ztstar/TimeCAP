Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of urban areas with moderate heat retention. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before declining sharply through the day, suggesting the influence of overnight moisture accumulation and subsequent drying. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning hours, likely associated with changing pressure gradients and shifting wind patterns. The wind direction transitioned from predominantly westerly to southerly and then to more easterly and northerly directions, indicating a circulation shift that may signal the approach of a frontal boundary or a change in weather patterns.
