Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a possible passage of a cold front during the night. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of dry air, likely associated with the frontal passage, before rising again in the afternoon. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the overnight hours, consistent with high-pressure system dominance, which contributed to improved conditions and clearer skies. Wind patterns shifted from northerly and westerly directions in the early evening to more variable and southerly flows by morning, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from unstable, cooler conditions to a more stable, warmer regime, with implications for potential afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
