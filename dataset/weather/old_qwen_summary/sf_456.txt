Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, gradually decreasing through the day, indicating a transition from a moist maritime influence to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, suggesting an approaching weather system, likely a low-pressure front moving into the region. Wind speeds increased significantly over the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions point to an active weather pattern, potentially bringing overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term, especially given the decreasing pressure and increasing wind activity.
