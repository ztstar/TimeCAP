Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight period, reaching saturation at multiple points, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to marine influence. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the night, but a notable increase in the late afternoon coincided with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the east-northeast, possibly signaling the arrival of a katabatic flow or a change in synoptic conditions. These combined patterns point to a coastal fog event driven by nocturnal cooling and marine air advection, with potential for prolonged visibility reduction and cooler temperatures into the coming hours.
