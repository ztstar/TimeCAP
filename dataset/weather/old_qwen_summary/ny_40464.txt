Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal pattern typical of the season. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, then sharply decreased, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure steadily climbed throughout the day, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher values and shifts in direction indicating dynamic atmospheric flow, possibly due to a developing pressure gradient. Combined, these trends suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather with cooler nights and warming days, though gusty conditions may persist into the evening.
