Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting increased moisture in the lower atmosphere that could contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the midday and early evening, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly in the late evening, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the influence of local topography. Overall, the data suggests a transition toward more stable, humid, and calm weather, with minimal risk of precipitation or strong winds in the immediate forecast.
