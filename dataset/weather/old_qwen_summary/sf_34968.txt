Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cool front. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight period, remaining elevated through the early morning before slightly declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a sharp decline in the early hours, followed by a steady recovery, which is typical of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and then to a southeasterly pattern, consistent with a change in air mass. These indicators collectively point to an active coastal weather pattern, likely involving marine layer development and frontal passage, which may result in cooler, foggy conditions in the morning and a gradual clearing later in the day.
