Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Temperatures remained consistently cool, with a notable overnight dip followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a stable nocturnal boundary layer. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast and later toward the northwest, possibly reflecting a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions point to a transition toward clearer skies and improved visibility, though lingering fog or low clouds may persist in coastal zones.
