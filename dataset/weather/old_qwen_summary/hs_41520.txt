Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near the early hours before dropping sharply midday, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring instability. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined patterns point to the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the evening or overnight, especially given the lingering moisture and increasing wind shear.
