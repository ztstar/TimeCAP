Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier, more settled conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or an approaching front. Wind speeds remained low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from near-northwest to southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric flow likely tied to a developing surface circulation. These combined patterns suggest the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, possibly increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms as the warmer, drier air interacts with residual moisture.
