Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend that likely reflects increasing solar insolation and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp increase in the early morning hours followed by a significant drop in the midday period, suggesting a mix of air mass advection and possible boundary layer changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a brief spike mid-morning and a subsequent decline, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, especially from the west to northwest, which may have contributed to mixing and dispersion of moisture and pollutants. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west in the final hours suggests an evolving circulation pattern, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather system.
