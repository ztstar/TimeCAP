Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as daylight returned, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping dramatically during midday, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by drying conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early evening, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a frontal system or localized low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a brief intensification in the late night and early morning, followed by calm conditions during midday and a resurgence of light winds in the late afternoon. Wind direction shifted dramatically from northerly to southerly and then to more easterly, indicating changing air mass influences, possibly associated with a developing or passing weather system.
