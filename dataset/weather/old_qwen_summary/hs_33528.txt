Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a significant daytime warming, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist conditions and a high likelihood of condensation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, followed by a gradual decline, hinting at the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that may signal the arrival of a changing air mass. These combined factors point to a transition period in the weather, with the potential for developing thunderstorms or unstable conditions later in the day due to the convergence of warm, moist air and increased wind shear.
