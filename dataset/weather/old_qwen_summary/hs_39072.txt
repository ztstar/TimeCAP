Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, indicating high moisture content in the atmosphere and increasing the likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable and stronger winds in the late evening, particularly from the south and southeast, hinting at potential inflow of moist air. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition from a damp, stable night toward a warmer, more humid day, with possible thunderstorm development if instability builds.
