Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline through the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually warming into the afternoon. A significant shift occurred in humidity, with a sharp rise to near saturation during the night, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, hinting at a shift in air mass and potential for precipitation. These combined patterns suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of more unstable and potentially stormy conditions.
