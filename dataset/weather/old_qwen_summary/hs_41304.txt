Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel during the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that has brought stable and drier conditions in recent hours. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of diminishing humidity, rising pressure, and light winds points to improving conditions, with a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable daytime temperatures.
