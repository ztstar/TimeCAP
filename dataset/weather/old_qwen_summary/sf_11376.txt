Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained stable during the early hours but sharply declined overnight, only to rise again in the late night and early morning before stabilizing. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the early hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which later stabilized and slightly increased, indicating a potential shift in weather patterns. Wind activity was minimal during the day, but a sudden surge in wind speed and a change in direction during the night point to a dynamic atmospheric shift, possibly linked to a frontal passage. These changes collectively suggest the influence of a passing weather front, potentially bringing cooler, moister conditions and variable winds in the coming hours.
