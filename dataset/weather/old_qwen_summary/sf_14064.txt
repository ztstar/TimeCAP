Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, suggesting fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind activity was intermittent but notable, with strong gusts from the west and northwest during key periods, likely driving coastal fog and influencing local wind patterns. The combination of these factors points to a typical marine layer pattern, with fog and cool conditions dominating overnight and improving to clearer, warmer conditions in the afternoon.
