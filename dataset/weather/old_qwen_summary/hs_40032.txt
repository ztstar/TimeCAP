Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining into the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase after midnight, reaching saturation around dawn before moderating, suggesting a period of potential fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the early hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds were strongest during the night and early morning, with a shift from northerly to easterly directions in the pre-dawn hours, consistent with a changing circulation pattern. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and decreasing humidity in the late afternoon suggests improving conditions and a transition toward more stable and pleasant weather.
