Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining into the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by daytime drying. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a peak in the late afternoon, which typically signals the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate with a shift in direction from northwest to east-southeast, indicating a transition in airflow that may be associated with the movement of a frontal boundary. The overall pattern points to clearing skies and improving conditions in the near term, with reduced moisture and increasing atmospheric stability.
