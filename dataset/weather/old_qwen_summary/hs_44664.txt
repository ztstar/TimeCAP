Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, reaching saturation around dawn before gradually declining, indicating the presence of a nocturnal fog or dew event. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly directions, with a notable increase in wind speed during mid-to-late afternoon, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These conditions point to a transition from a stable, moist nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity later in the day.
