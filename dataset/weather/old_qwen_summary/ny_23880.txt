Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend overnight and a warming phase as daylight returned. Humidity levels were consistently high in the early hours, dropping significantly during the afternoon and remaining low into the evening, suggesting a drying trend likely due to a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system moving in, typically associated with improving and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained light to moderate, with a noticeable decrease in the mid-afternoon before increasing again in the evening, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then northerly, reflecting changing circulation patterns. Together, these indicators point to a transition toward drier, more stable air under a dominant high-pressure system, likely leading to clear skies and comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
