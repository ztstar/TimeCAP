Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly through the night, reaching a peak in the early morning hours before beginning to decrease, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that has since started to dissipate. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, indicating the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with minimal variability, though a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast suggests a change in air flow patterns associated with the high-pressure build-up. These trends collectively point to a transitioning weather pattern, with improving conditions and reduced potential for precipitation in the near term.
