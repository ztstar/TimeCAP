Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of strong frontal activity or storm systems influencing the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southwest, indicating a change in local circulation patterns possibly linked to surface heating and regional airflow. These conditions collectively point to a humid, unstable environment with potential for localized convective activity later in the day, particularly if daytime heating intensifies.
