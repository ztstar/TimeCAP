Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed notable fluctuations, with prolonged periods of moderate humidity interspersed with spikes during early morning and late night, suggesting possible fog formation or marine layer influence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and clear conditions. Wind patterns were generally light but showed intermittent shifts in direction, including southerly and easterly flows, which may have influenced coastal moisture transport and fog movement. These combined factors suggest a typical coastal pattern with a developing marine layer in the early hours and improving conditions later in the day, potentially leading to clearer skies and mild temperatures.
