Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced overnight drop, followed by a gradual recovery during the day, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, signaling the arrival and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities from the west-southwest, suggesting strong inflow associated with the storm system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and later to northerly suggests a transition in airflow, likely bringing colder, drier air behind the front.
