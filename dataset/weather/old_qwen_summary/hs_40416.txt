Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and low cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to overnight condensation and minimal wind mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a steady high-pressure influence that suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast during the morning hours, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weak frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns may increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
