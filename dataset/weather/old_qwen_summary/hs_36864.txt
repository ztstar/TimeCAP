Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming phase as the day progressed, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and night, peaking near saturation, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, particularly in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and southeasterly directions, consistent with inflow associated with an approaching weather disturbance. These combined trends point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially during the overnight hours.
