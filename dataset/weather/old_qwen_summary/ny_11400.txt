Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the late afternoon and evening, indicating the arrival of a warming trend likely associated with a shifting air mass. Humidity levels showed a pronounced oscillation, with sustained high values during early morning and late evening hours, suggesting periods of stable, moist air, while midday drops point to drier, possibly cleared conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline in the early hours, followed by a recovery toward the end of the period, which may reflect the passage of a low-pressure system and the beginning of an improving pattern. Wind activity was generally light during the day, with a brief lull in the early morning and a sudden increase in speed during the late afternoon, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southwest to more variable and even northeasterly at times, potentially signaling a change in airflow that could influence future precipitation or temperature trends.
