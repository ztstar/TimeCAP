Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the influence of daytime heating. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout most of the day, particularly during early morning and late-night hours, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could support precipitation. A notable drop in humidity occurred during midday, followed by a rebound in the evening, which may indicate a shift in air mass or localized convective activity. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and southerly wind directions, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system or sea breeze circulation. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, consistent with the potential for developing weather systems, including thunderstorms, in the coming hours.
