Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining into the early hours of the day before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for over 10 consecutive hours, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained stable until mid-afternoon, when it began to rise slightly, suggesting the potential arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the day, with a notable increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, which may signal a change in air mass. These conditions collectively point to a marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with persistent fog and cool, damp conditions likely to continue into the coming hours.
