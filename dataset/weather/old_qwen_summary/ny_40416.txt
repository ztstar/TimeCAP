Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining consistently throughout the night and into the morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the evening and overnight, peaking in the upper 80s and 90s, indicating a likely increase in moisture content and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a persistent downward trend, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable and stormy weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the latter half of the period, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, aligned with shifting wind directions toward the southeast and east, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing rain or showers and cooler conditions to New York City in the near term.
