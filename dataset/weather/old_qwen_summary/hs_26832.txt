Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity remained consistently high, suggesting saturated air conditions that could contribute to discomfort and potential fog formation. Air pressure gradually decreased, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which often correlates with unstable weather and increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with stronger gusts from a shifting wind direction originating from the northeast, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term, especially during the early morning hours, and highlight the importance of monitoring for potential flash flooding risks.
