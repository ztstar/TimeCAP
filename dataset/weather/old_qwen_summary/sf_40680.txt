Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining into the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching near-saturation conditions during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a marked decline through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with strong gusts from the south and west, consistent with a shift in wind direction that may signal a change in regional air mass. These patterns collectively suggest a dynamic weather shift, potentially setting the stage for improved conditions with the arrival of a stronger high-pressure system later in the day.
