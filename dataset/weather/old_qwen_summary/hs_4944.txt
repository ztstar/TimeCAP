Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. A sharp increase in air pressure during the early morning hours, particularly around midday, reflects the passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and early afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, hinting at the onset of a sea breeze pattern common in coastal areas. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a warmer, drier, and breezier afternoon, with the potential for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift persist.
