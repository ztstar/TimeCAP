Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could contribute to fog or drizzle. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, likely driven by frontal activity associated with the low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly suggests a dynamic atmospheric setup, consistent with the movement of a storm system that could bring precipitation and potentially stronger winds in the coming hours.
