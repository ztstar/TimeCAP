Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with repeated spikes during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation and marine layer activity common in the region. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then stabilized, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system and possible approaching weather changes. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to stronger, more consistent winds from the north and northeast, likely driven by thermal gradients and synoptic-scale influences. The persistent presence of northerly and easterly winds, combined with cooling temperatures and high humidity, points to the continued influence of the marine layer, which may lead to foggy conditions overnight and into the next morning.
