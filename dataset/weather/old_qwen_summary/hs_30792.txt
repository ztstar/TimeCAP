Temperature showed a steady decline during the overnight hours, reaching a minimum before sharply rising in the late afternoon, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the morning, remained low through midday, and then surged in the evening, suggesting the arrival of moisture-laden air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak front or localized atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds increased abruptly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, consistent with a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition phase in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover or thunderstorm development later in the day.
