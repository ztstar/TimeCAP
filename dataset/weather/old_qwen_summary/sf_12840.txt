Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting a drying phase, before rising again in the late night and early morning, likely due to fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather change. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with strong westerly and southwesterly gusts, consistent with marine layer activity and onshore flow, before tapering off during the midday. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and the presence of fog-related humidity spikes confirm the influence of the Pacific marine layer, a hallmark of San Francisco’s weather patterns, particularly in the evening and overnight hours.
