Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a stable temperature profile with a gradual increase in the latter half, suggesting a warming trend during the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high early on, followed by a notable drop in the final hours, indicating a drying trend likely due to shifting air mass or reduced moisture inflow. Air pressure showed a steady rise, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and potential for clearer skies ahead. Wind speed decreased significantly in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, hinting at a change in circulation patterns. These combined signals suggest a transition toward more stable and drier conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the near term.
