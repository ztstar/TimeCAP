Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and maintaining near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure showed significant variability, with a sharp rise in the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a strong high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the mid-morning and late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, indicating changing local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, moist maritime influence to a more variable, potentially clearer regime, with implications for visibility and comfort in the urban environment.
