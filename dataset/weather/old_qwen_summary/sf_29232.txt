Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature dip, before dropping sharply in the afternoon. A significant increase in air pressure was observed in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized the atmosphere and likely suppressed cloud development. Wind patterns shifted notably in the late evening, with a transition from westerly to more southerly and easterly directions, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass. These changes collectively suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable coastal regime to a drier, warmer, and more variable weather pattern, which could lead to clearer skies and increased daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
