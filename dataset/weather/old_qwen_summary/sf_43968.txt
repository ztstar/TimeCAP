Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose dramatically overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun heated the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight downward trend in the late afternoon and evening, hinting at the approach of a weakening weather system or shifting pressure gradient. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, then increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from offshore (northwesterly) to onshore (southeasterly), potentially signaling the arrival of a sea breeze or change in synoptic flow. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool maritime environment toward a drier, warmer, and more dynamically active afternoon and evening, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate variability.
