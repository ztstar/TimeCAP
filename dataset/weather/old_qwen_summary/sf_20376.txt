Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of cool temperatures, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation in the early morning and staying near or at 100%, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting an approaching weather system, possibly a low-pressure front, which could bring increased precipitation. Wind speeds remained uniformly low, but wind direction underwent significant shifts, particularly in the afternoon and evening, with a marked change from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a stable, maritime-influenced climate with potential for foggy mornings and a developing weather pattern that may introduce rain or stronger winds later.
