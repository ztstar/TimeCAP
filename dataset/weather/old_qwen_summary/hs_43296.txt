Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight period, indicating the presence of moist air masses, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility in the early hours. A notable drop in wind speed accompanied the high humidity, suggesting a period of stagnation in the lower atmosphere, possibly enhancing the formation of fog and haze. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend through the night, culminating in a peak just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing drier, more stable conditions. Wind direction shifted from consistent easterly to more northerly and westerly, hinting at a change in airflow that could influence incoming weather patterns, including potential afternoon thunderstorm development as temperatures rise.
