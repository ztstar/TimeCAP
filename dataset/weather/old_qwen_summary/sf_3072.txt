Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily decreasing through the night before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high through the night, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early hours. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, indicating the approach and establishment of a stable high-pressure system, which typically brings calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting changing local circulation patterns, possibly influenced by marine layer dynamics. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and variable winds points to a persistent marine layer, contributing to cool, damp conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
