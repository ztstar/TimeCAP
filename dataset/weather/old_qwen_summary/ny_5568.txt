Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is associated with unstable and potentially stormy conditions. Wind activity remained minimal until mid-morning, when a sudden increase in wind speed and a shift in direction from the southeast to the northwest suggest the onset of a frontal passage. The combination of rising temperature, dropping pressure, and increased wind suggests that a weather front is moving through the city, potentially bringing precipitation and unsettled conditions in the near term.
