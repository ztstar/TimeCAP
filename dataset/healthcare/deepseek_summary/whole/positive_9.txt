Influenza activity has shown a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with sharp increases in both the number of specimens tested and the proportion testing positive, peaking in the most recent weeks. The dominance of Influenza A in the positive cases has grown significantly, outpacing Influenza B, which has remained relatively stable in proportion but has shown a gradual rise in absolute numbers. A notable inflection point occurred in the 14th week, after which the positivity rate began to decline, suggesting a possible slowdown in transmission despite high levels of testing. The recent stabilization in positivity ratios, particularly for Influenza B, may indicate the onset of a plateau or early decline in the seasonal wave. These trends underscore the need for continued surveillance, targeted vaccination efforts, and preparedness for potential resurgence, especially in vulnerable populations.
