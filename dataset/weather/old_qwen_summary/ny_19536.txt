Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, suggesting high moisture content in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog or drizzle conditions. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours, followed by a steady rise, points to the passage of a low-pressure system that has since moved out, bringing improved conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southerly to southwesterly winds persisting through the night, which could enhance heat loss and contribute to a more pronounced chill. The shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest in the final hours suggests the arrival of drier, cooler air, signaling a transition to clearer skies and more stable weather conditions.
