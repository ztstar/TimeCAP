Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and a higher likelihood of fog or mist formation during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the early morning, stabilizing before a gradual decline later in the day, hinting at a developing low-pressure influence that could bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, transitioning from light, variable winds to more consistent southerly and easterly flows, potentially signaling the approach of a moist air mass. The combination of rising humidity, warming temperatures, and changing wind direction suggests a high probability of afternoon thunderstorms developing later in the day.
