Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low wind speeds. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the midday hours, suggesting dry air advection, while a sharp rise in the late evening points to increased moisture, possibly from coastal fog formation. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sustained period of high pressure followed by a drop in the early morning, which may have contributed to the onset of changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast and east, potentially signaling the arrival of an onshore flow or a shift in synoptic patterns. Combined, these indicators suggest the influence of a coastal breeze cycle transitioning into a more dynamic weather system, with potential for fog or overcast conditions later in the day.
