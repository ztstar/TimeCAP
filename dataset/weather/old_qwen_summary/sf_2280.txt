Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours before declining, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from southerly to northerly, hinting at a change in local circulation patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and increasing pressure points to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, more stable air as the day progressed.
