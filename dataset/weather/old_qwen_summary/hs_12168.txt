Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift from a stable nocturnal pattern to increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels dropped sharply around dawn, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture, with a significant rebound in the late afternoon, likely due to convective activity or increased evaporation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before slightly declining, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure system and the onset of localized instability. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong, consistent easterly to southerly flow preceding the temperature minimum, followed by a marked reduction in wind speeds during the midday hours. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, aligning with a developing low-level inflow that could support afternoon thunderstorm development, especially given the combination of warming temperatures and rising humidity.
