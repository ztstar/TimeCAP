Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained moderately high throughout, with slight fluctuations that suggest persistent moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, signaling a change in air mass flow. This combination of rising pressure, warming temperatures, and shifting winds points to a transition toward more stable and potentially clearer conditions in the near term.
