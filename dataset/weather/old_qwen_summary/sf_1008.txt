Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low stratus clouds that likely dissipated as temperatures climbed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak frontal system or a shift in local wind patterns. Wind activity was minimal during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with shifts in direction indicating changing air flow, possibly due to marine layer dynamics or local topography effects. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and foggy morning to a warmer, drier, and more stable afternoon, consistent with typical coastal fog dissipation patterns in San Francisco.
