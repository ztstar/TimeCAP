Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicative of a diurnal cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around the early morning, with winds transitioning from southerly to northeasterly directions and increasing in speed, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system. Air pressure fluctuated with a distinct dip followed by a recovery, particularly during the early morning and midday, aligning with the movement of a low-pressure feature through the region. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind speeds in the afternoon raises the potential for isolated thunderstorms, especially in the late afternoon or evening hours.
