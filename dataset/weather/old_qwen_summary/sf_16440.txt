Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A gradual decrease in air pressure was observed, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling possible approaching weather changes or a shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased steadily from minimal levels in the morning to moderate gusts by late evening, with wind direction shifting from southwest to more southerly and then easterly, suggesting a change in air mass flow. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to clearer skies and a shift in wind patterns as the night progresses.
