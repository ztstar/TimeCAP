Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before stabilizing in the morning. A dramatic shift in humidity occurred around midnight, with levels spiking to near saturation followed by a sharp decline, indicating a possible fog dissipation or a passing moisture front. Air pressure showed a brief peak midday, suggesting the influence of a transient high-pressure system, though it quickly returned to near-steady levels. Wind patterns revealed a shift from predominantly southerly and westerly flows to stronger northerly and easterly gusts in the late evening, likely driven by local topography and coastal dynamics. The combination of falling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and increased wind speeds late in the period suggests the arrival of a cool, potentially stormy maritime influence, which may lead to overcast skies and light precipitation in the coming hours.
