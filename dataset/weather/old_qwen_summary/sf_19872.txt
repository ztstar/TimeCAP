Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a cool, stable nocturnal period with minimal daytime warming. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the early morning hours, consistent with the approach of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased slightly in the early morning and remained moderate through midday, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest, signaling a change in airflow possibly linked to coastal influences. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer influence, contributing to cool, damp conditions that are characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly during transitional periods between day and night.
