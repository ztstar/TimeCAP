Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming phase through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, dropping significantly in the mid-morning before stabilizing at lower values, suggesting a drying trend as daytime heating progressed. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, which may signal the passage of a weakening low-pressure system or approaching frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, potentially indicating a change in local circulation patterns. The combination of warming temperatures, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests the possibility of developing convective activity later in the day, warranting caution for potential afternoon thunderstorms.
