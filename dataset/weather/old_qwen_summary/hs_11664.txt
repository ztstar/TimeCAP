Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, peaking in the afternoon before gradually declining, indicating a significant diurnal heating cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained persistently high through the early and middle portions of the day, with a sharp drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a changing air mass or possible convective activity. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the midday hours, followed by a recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, consistent with a surge of moist, unstable air that could support thunderstorm development. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to westerly and northerly in the late evening suggests changing atmospheric dynamics, potentially indicating the approach of a cold front or a shift in circulation patterns.
