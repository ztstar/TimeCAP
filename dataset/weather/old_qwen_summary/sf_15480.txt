Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend during the day, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before slightly cooling overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a high that persisted into midday, indicating increased moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained light and consistent through most of the day, with a shift to slightly stronger winds from the southwest in the evening, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The wind direction shifted gradually from southwesterly to more southerly, aligning with typical coastal patterns, which may indicate a strengthening onshore flow and potential for fog development later in the night.
