Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low wind conditions. Humidity levels spiked dramatically in the middle of the night, suggesting the onset of dew point saturation, which may have contributed to fog formation or increased moisture availability for potential afternoon convection. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions during the early hours, though a slight decline later suggests possible weakening or shifting dynamics. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and eventually westerly, hinting at a change in air mass or the approach of a boundary. These combined trends point to a transition period—potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day, especially if moisture remains high and the afternoon heating intensifies.
