Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels remained near saturation overnight, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to the cold discomfort despite the gradual temperature recovery. A sharp drop in air pressure during the late night and early morning, coupled with a shift toward lower wind speeds, points to the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics and the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the potential for precipitation in the near term, with lingering dampness and a cooler feel persisting into the day.
