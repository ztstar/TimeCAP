Over the past 24 hours, temperatures remained relatively stable with a slight cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting a period of condensation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend overnight, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more northerly and then easterly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially leading to cooler and more unsettled skies in the coming hours.
