Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping significantly as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to more convective daytime patterns. A notable spike in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system and potential instability later in the day. Wind patterns showed periods of calm and variable direction, with a distinct shift toward southerly and easterly flows in the evening, potentially transporting moisture into the area. These combined factors suggest increasing atmospheric instability, raising the likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms in the coming hours.
