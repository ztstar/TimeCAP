Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold night to a milder day. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline in the early hours, remaining low through midday before stabilizing, suggesting clearing skies and drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, which is a strong indicator of improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and early evening, with strong gusts from the northwest, likely bringing cooler air and contributing to the temperature drop. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the late evening suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the end of a cold front and the beginning of more stable, settled weather.
