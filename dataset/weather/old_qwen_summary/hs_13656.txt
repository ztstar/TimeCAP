Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained high during the overnight hours, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, which likely contributed to a muggy atmosphere. A noticeable drop in humidity occurred during the midday and afternoon, coinciding with a rise in temperature and increased wind activity, which may have facilitated evaporative cooling. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly directions, with sustained higher speeds in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the influence of a developing low-pressure system or frontal passage. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a consistent trend of minor decreases in the latter half of the day, which, combined with the wind shift and temperature rise, suggests an approaching weather change that could bring precipitation later.
