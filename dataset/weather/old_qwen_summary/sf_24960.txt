Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of both nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the early morning, indicating a dry-out phase likely due to mixing of air masses, before rising again in the late afternoon, which may signal the return of marine influence. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, followed by a sharp drop in the evening—this pattern is typical of a passing weather system, possibly a low-pressure trough affecting the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, with gusts reaching higher levels, driven by a shift in wind direction from offshore to more onshore and variable sectors, which could indicate the onset of a coastal breeze or frontal passage. Combined, these trends suggest a dynamic transition in the local weather, with potential for changing conditions such as fog dissipation or the arrival of cooler, moist air, which could impact visibility and comfort in the coming hours.
