Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity dropped significantly during the day, particularly in the afternoon, suggesting drier conditions as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then rose steadily during the afternoon, pointing to improving weather conditions and potential high-pressure influence. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the northwest and west sectors, which may signal a shift in atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable weather, with enhanced breezes likely affecting outdoor conditions and air quality.
