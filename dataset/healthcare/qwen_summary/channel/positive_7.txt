- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the 20-week period, with a notable acceleration in growth during the latter half, suggesting increasing influenza activity. A clear peak occurred in the 15th week, followed by a sharp decline, indicating a possible outbreak peak and subsequent waning of transmission. The trajectory implies a seasonal pattern with significant burden on the healthcare system, requiring preparedness for ongoing surveillance and potential resource allocation.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a pronounced upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid surge in influenza activity, peaking dramatically before declining sharply in the subsequent weeks. The sustained high levels followed by a steep decrease suggest the completion of a major influenza wave, likely driven by seasonal factors and potential public health interventions. The current downward trend indicates a transition toward lower transmission, but vigilance is warranted to detect any resurgence or emergence of new strains.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a clear upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sustained increase beginning around week 10, suggesting the onset and progression of a significant influenza B outbreak. The peak occurred in the latter half of the period, followed by a gradual decline, indicating a possible waning phase of the seasonal surge. The sharp rise and subsequent high levels of positivity signal a substantial public health burden, warranting intensified surveillance, resource allocation, and potential intervention strategies such as vaccination campaigns and clinical preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained and steep upward trajectory over the first 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza positivity, likely signaling the onset and peak of a seasonal outbreak. After reaching a high point, a sharp decline is observed in the final five weeks, indicating a significant reduction in transmission, possibly due to waning immunity, public health interventions, or the natural course of the season. The pattern suggests a classic epidemic curve with a clear peak followed by a substantial rebound in the community, warranting continued surveillance to detect any resurgence.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a clear upward trajectory over the initial 15 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza A positivity, with a peak observed during the latter half of this period. A sharp decline followed the peak, indicating a post-epidemic reduction in prevalence, suggesting the potential end of a significant outbreak phase. The sustained high levels preceding the decline and the subsequent drop imply a cyclical pattern consistent with seasonal influenza dynamics, warranting continued surveillance to detect early signs of resurgence.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a steady upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a significant acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a rapid increase in influenza B activity. The data reveal a clear peak in the most recent weeks, indicating the onset of a strong seasonal surge that may exceed typical seasonal thresholds. This sustained rise, particularly after the midpoint of the series, signals heightened community transmission and underscores the need for heightened surveillance, public health preparedness, and potential intervention strategies.
