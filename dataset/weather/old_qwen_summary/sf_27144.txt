Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking during the lowest temperatures, which suggests the presence of a dense fog or low cloud cover common to the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a significant rise during the early morning hours, followed by a sustained high-pressure regime, signaling stable atmospheric conditions that likely contributed to the suppression of precipitation. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the east and southeast, possibly indicating the onset of a sea breeze or a shift in synoptic flow. The change in wind direction from westerly to easterly and then to southerly suggests the influence of local topography and pressure gradients, potentially leading to variable microclimates across the city.
