Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. This was accompanied by a sharp increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, consistent with an approaching frontal boundary. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the night, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply as the system moved eastward, suggesting possible precipitation that has now cleared. Temperature trends show a cooling trend overnight followed by a steady rise through the day, signaling the arrival of warmer, drier air behind the front. The current wind pattern and rising pressure suggest improving conditions, with a transition toward stable, mild weather in the coming hours.
