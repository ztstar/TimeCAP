Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation before beginning to fall, indicating potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which has since stabilized with minor fluctuations. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition toward more stable conditions, with limited potential for convective activity in the near term.
