Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early hours, indicating a persistent marine influence, before sharply declining in the midday, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the early evening, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow in the early morning transitioning to more variable directions later, reflecting changing local wind patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, drying air, and rising pressure suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions, typical of a weakening marine layer and a shift toward a more typical San Francisco afternoon pattern.
