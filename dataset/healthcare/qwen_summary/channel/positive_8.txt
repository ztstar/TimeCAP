- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp acceleration in activity during the latter half of the period, signaling increasing influenza circulation. The peak occurred in the middle of the timeframe, followed by a steady decline, suggesting the onset of a seasonal influenza wave that has begun to wane. This pattern is consistent with typical seasonal influenza dynamics, indicating heightened surveillance and potential strain on healthcare resources during the peak phase.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a sharp upward trend over the first 15 weeks, peaking dramatically before a substantial decline in the subsequent weeks, suggesting a well-defined influenza A epidemic wave. The rapid rise followed by a steep decrease indicates a short-lived but intense outbreak, possibly driven by seasonal factors or viral transmission dynamics. The current downward trajectory signals a waning phase of the outbreak, though residual activity remains elevated, warranting continued surveillance to detect potential resurgence or shift in circulating strains.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a steep upward trend over the first 12 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza B positivity, peaking in the latter half of this period before declining sharply. The subsequent decline over the final 8 weeks suggests a waning phase of the seasonal outbreak, with a sustained reduction in case positivity following the peak. This pattern is consistent with typical influenza seasonality, indicating a late-season surge followed by natural resolution, which may inform public health preparedness and resource allocation for future cycles.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating increase over the first 14 weeks, indicating a sharp rise in influenza activity, likely signaling the peak of a seasonal outbreak. Following the peak, a notable decline is observed over the subsequent 6 weeks, suggesting a waning phase of the outbreak with a return toward baseline levels. The magnitude and duration of the peak, combined with the rapid decline, imply strong seasonal dynamics and possible impact on healthcare demand, warranting continued surveillance and preparedness measures.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator exhibits a sharp upward trend over the initial 15 weeks, indicating a rapid escalation in influenza A positivity, peaking during the latter half of this period. Following the peak, a pronounced decline is observed over the subsequent five weeks, suggesting a possible waning of the current influenza wave. The sustained high levels followed by a significant drop may reflect the natural course of an epidemic, with potential implications for public health monitoring, resource allocation, and intervention timing.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating increase in influenza B positivity, transitioning from low baseline levels to a sharp upward trajectory that peaks in the most recent weeks. This pattern suggests the onset of a significant influenza B activity wave, likely entering its peak phase, with sustained high levels indicating widespread circulation within the population. The lack of decline in recent weeks, despite the peak, implies prolonged community transmission, which may strain healthcare resources and underscore the urgency for preventive measures and targeted public health interventions.
