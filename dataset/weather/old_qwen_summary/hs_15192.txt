Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and again during the late night, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air masses that may have contributed to localized cloud formation or fog. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the mid-to-late night, reaching a high point before declining in the morning, which typically signals the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified during the morning and evening hours, with consistent southerly to westerly flow, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability that could support convective activity. Together, these trends point to a developing weather pattern that may lead to afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the combination of rising temperatures, sustained moisture, and increasing wind shear.
