Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop in the midday period followed by a recovery in the evening, suggesting possible dry air advection. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, likely contributing to the pressure drop and mixing of air masses. The shift in wind direction from the south-southeast to the west and northwest, combined with the pressure and temperature trends, points to a dynamic atmospheric setup that could lead to changing conditions, including potential for precipitation later in the day.
