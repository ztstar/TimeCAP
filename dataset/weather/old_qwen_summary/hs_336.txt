Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass. These combined factors suggest the passage of a frontal system, potentially leading to scattered storms or thunderstorms later in the day.
