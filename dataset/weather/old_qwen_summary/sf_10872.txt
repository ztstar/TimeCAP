Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with distinct spikes during the early morning and late night, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing conditions later in the period. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief periods of higher activity and variable wind directions, including shifts from offshore to onshore flows, which may have facilitated the movement of coastal moisture. These patterns collectively point to a typical coastal marine weather cycle, with cooling, fog, and stable conditions characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate.
