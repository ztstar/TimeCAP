Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a period of rising stability followed by a slight decline, suggesting the passage of a weather system that may have brought brief precipitation. Wind speeds exhibited a notable spike during the overnight period, paired with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a frontal passage or localized storm development. The combination of high humidity, low wind gusts later in the cycle, and fluctuating pressure patterns points to a lingering potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
