Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp feel. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the middle of the night, followed by a recovery and then a sharp drop in the late afternoon, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds decreased substantially during the overnight hours, with near-calms in the early morning, but increased again in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by shifting pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system, which may portend changing conditions in the coming hours.
