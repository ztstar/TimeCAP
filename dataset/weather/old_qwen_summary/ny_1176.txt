Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or low visibility during those periods. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and into the early morning, with a notable drop in the last few hours—indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, consistent with the strengthening influence of a developing storm system. These combined trends point to deteriorating weather conditions, with an elevated risk of rain or drizzle in the coming hours, particularly as the low-pressure system moves closer to the city.
