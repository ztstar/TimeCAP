Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased through the morning and early afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to cool, suggesting a warming trend followed by a cooling phase associated with frontal passage. Humidity remained near saturation during the early morning hours, then sharply decreased in the afternoon, signaling the drying of the air as a front moved through. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southerly and finally to westerly, consistent with the development of a cyclonic circulation. These combined patterns point to the influence of an active weather system, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially stronger winds in the coming hours.
