Temperature trends indicate a nighttime cooling followed by a steady daytime warming, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, then sharply declined through the afternoon, pointing to a drying trend likely driven by increasing temperatures and wind. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the midday hours, particularly from the southeast to south-southwest, indicating a shift in airflow that could influence heat distribution and potential storm development. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition toward warmer, drier conditions with increasing atmospheric instability, raising the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
