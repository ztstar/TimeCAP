Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to a warming day. Humidity levels peaked at saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to the cooler feel despite rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly sectors, which may indicate the influence of a changing pressure gradient or an approaching front. These combined indicators suggest that Houston is transitioning through a period of high moisture and shifting wind patterns, which could lead to unstable conditions and the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
