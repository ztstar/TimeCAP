Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and shifting air masses. Humidity remained near saturation through the early morning hours, suggesting nocturnal condensation or a stalled front, before decreasing significantly during the day, which may point to the onset of drier air entrainment. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and eventually westerly, consistent with the development of a developing storm system. Together, these indicators suggest an evolving weather pattern conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, with potential for heavy rainfall and gusty winds in the coming hours.
