Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to daytime heating. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike during the early morning and late evening, suggesting periods of moisture accumulation, likely linked to dew formation or low-level convergence. Air pressure remained relatively steady through the night with a slight rise in the mid-morning, hinting at the influence of a weak high-pressure system, though a drop later in the day may signal an approaching disturbance. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly reaching strong levels during the final hours, driven by shifting wind directions from the east to southeast, which may indicate the onset of a convective or frontal influence. These combined factors suggest a high potential for developing thunderstorms, especially if moist air continues to be drawn in, making conditions ripe for afternoon or evening convection.
