Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, reaching saturation before sharply declining during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a few brief increases, and wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined trends point to the passage of a frontal boundary, resulting in a shift from humid, potentially storm-prone conditions to a drier, more stable environment favorable for fair weather.
