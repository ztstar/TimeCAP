Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again during the day. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating a stable, moist air mass, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, except for brief periods of stronger gusts during the night and late afternoon, with directional shifts indicating changing airflow patterns. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind suggests the potential for foggy conditions and possible precipitation as the system develops.
