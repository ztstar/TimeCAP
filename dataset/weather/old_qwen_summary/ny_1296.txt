Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the early hours, indicating a drying trend, which may have contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Air pressure remained relatively low throughout the period, suggesting an ongoing influence of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, peaking in the late hours, with strong northerly and westerly winds likely enhancing the wind chill and contributing to a more pronounced cooling effect. The shift in wind direction from southerly to predominantly westerly and northwesterly suggests the passage of a cold front, potentially signaling a transition to cooler, drier conditions in the coming hours.
