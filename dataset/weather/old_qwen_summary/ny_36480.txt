Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant overnight cooling effect. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, with prolonged periods of saturation, especially during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather.
