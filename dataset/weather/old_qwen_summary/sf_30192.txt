Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a more dynamic daytime regime. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, dropping sharply in the mid-afternoon before rebounding slightly in the evening, suggesting the influence of a marine layer that began to break down. Air pressure dropped significantly during the night, particularly in the early hours, before stabilizing and then rising again toward the end of the period, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system followed by a return to more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with sustained easterly to southeasterly flow during the night and early morning, shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon, likely due to changing pressure gradients. These patterns collectively suggest a coastal fog event that lifted during the day, consistent with typical San Francisco weather dynamics, with implications for visibility, temperature comfort, and potential for afternoon clearing.
