Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a significant spike during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a passing frontal system, followed by a marked drop as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, peaking just before a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from high-pressure dominance to a weakening system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly, hinting at changing atmospheric flow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest the passage of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to unsettled weather with possible precipitation in the near term.
