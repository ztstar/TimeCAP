Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early hours before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to fog formation. Air pressure steadily rose from near 1029 hPa to a peak of 1033 hPa, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind activity was minimal overall, with brief bursts from the west and south during the night and early morning, consistent with coastal wind patterns associated with thermal gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and a stable high-pressure ridge suggests the likelihood of persistent fog or low cloud cover, especially in the early morning hours, which may impact visibility and morning commute conditions.
