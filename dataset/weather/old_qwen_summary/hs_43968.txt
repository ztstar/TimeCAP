Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying due to increased temperatures and wind. Air pressure remained stable through the night, then declined in the late afternoon, signaling possible atmospheric instability and a potential shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and later to westerly, which may indicate the approach of a developing weather system. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions becoming less humid and more stable in the evening, but potential for changing conditions overnight due to evolving wind patterns and pressure changes.
