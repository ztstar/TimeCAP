Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cooling and daytime heating. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before sunrise, which suggests the presence of fog or mist formation during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure steadily rose through the morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to easterly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, likely resulting in improving visibility and partly cloudy to clear skies in the coming hours.
