Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained persistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the late morning before stabilizing at moderate levels, indicating a transition from a saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, signaling a change in circulation patterns that may facilitate moisture transport. Taken together, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night-time environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for improved visibility and reduced chance of precipitation in the coming hours.
