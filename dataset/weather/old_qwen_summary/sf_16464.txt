Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures decreasing through the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity but consistent atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a persistent southerly to westerly flow that gradually shifted toward the northwesterly direction by late evening, suggesting a changing boundary layer pattern. These conditions collectively point to a coastal fog event driven by nighttime cooling and high moisture, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with implications for travel and outdoor activities.
