Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, particularly in the early morning hours. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point just before dawn, indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including a notable southerly flow, which likely contributed to moisture influx and instability. These conditions collectively point to a period of deteriorating weather, with strong potential for precipitation and reduced visibility, especially during the early morning hours.
