Temperature dropped sharply during the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels surged during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, reducing visibility. Air pressure showed a marked decrease in the afternoon, followed by a recovery in the evening, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the northeast, consistent with a developing frontal system. Combined, these trends point to a transition period in New York City’s weather, with potential for rain or showers in the near term as the system moves through the region.
