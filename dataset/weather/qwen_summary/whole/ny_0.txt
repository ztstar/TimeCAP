Temperature exhibited a steady rise through the early and mid-period, followed by a sharp increase in the afternoon, suggesting a significant warming trend likely due to solar heating and changing air masses. Humidity levels declined steadily through the day, reaching a minimum in the late afternoon before gradually recovering, indicating drying air conditions consistent with fair weather or a weakening moisture source. Air pressure remained largely stable through most of the day, with a brief dip followed by a modest recovery, implying weak atmospheric instability or a passing weak front. Wind speed showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, especially between the 16th and 19th hours, followed by a resurgence in the evening, accompanied by a major shift in wind direction from southwest to west and then to variable patterns, hinting at changing circulation dynamics. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests the onset of a warming and drying trend, potentially indicating the approach of a high-pressure system influencing the region.
