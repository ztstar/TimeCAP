Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night, peaking at saturation, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility in the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with the recent precipitation and cloud cover. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained breezes from the southeast and south-southeast, suggesting an approaching front or shift in air mass. These combined conditions point to a period of unstable weather with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as the atmosphere continues to warm and moisture remains abundant.
