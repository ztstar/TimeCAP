Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated, particularly during the early hours, indicating persistent moisture near the surface, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed a steady rise, peaking in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the day, dropping significantly overnight before increasing again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction reflecting changing circulation patterns. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cool, moist maritime regime toward a drier, more stable environment, which could lead to improved visibility and potentially sunny conditions in the coming hours.
