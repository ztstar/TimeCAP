- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a steady decline throughout the initial 16 hours, indicating a consistent drying trend likely driven by atmospheric conditions such as subsidence or reduced moisture inflow. A sharp and significant drop occurred between the 16th and 19th hours, followed by a sudden rebound and stabilization, suggesting a localized event such as a passing front or microclimate shift. This volatility implies potential for changing weather conditions, including possible precipitation or temperature changes, warranting attention for short-term forecasting and public advisories.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has remained stable at a consistent level for the majority of the past 24 hours, indicating a period of atmospheric stability. A brief drop occurred mid-period, followed by a recovery and a subsequent rise, suggesting a transient disturbance likely associated with a passing weather system. The overall pattern implies a transition from a stable regime to a slightly dynamic one, potentially signaling evolving weather conditions in the region.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature trend exhibits a steady increase through the early and mid-period, followed by a sharp rise in the latter half, indicating a significant warming phase likely linked to diurnal heating or atmospheric changes. A notable anomaly occurs mid-series where a rapid spike is followed by a steep decline, suggesting a possible transient meteorological event such as a sudden front or localized heat pulse. The subsequent recovery to a moderate level implies stabilization, but the overall pattern reflects dynamic thermal shifts that could impact public comfort and energy demand.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a stable period of consistent values before abruptly dropping to minimal levels, followed by a sudden spike back to moderate intensities, indicating a brief but significant disruption in wind patterns. The presence of repeated low values, particularly near the 18th hour, suggests a temporary lull, possibly associated with localized atmospheric stabilization or a shift in pressure systems. The irregular fluctuations afterward, including a reversal to higher speeds, point to dynamic and unstable atmospheric conditions, which may influence short-term weather developments such as air quality dispersion or localized turbulence.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction has shown a consistent shift from a southerly to a westerly quadrant over the past 24 hours, indicating a notable change in prevailing wind patterns. A sharp deviation mid-timeline—marked by a sudden swing from west to south-southwest—suggests a possible passage of a weather front or local atmospheric disturbance. The subsequent stabilization near the southwestern sector implies that the system may be settling, which could signal a shift in the immediate weather regime, potentially affecting temperature and precipitation trends.
