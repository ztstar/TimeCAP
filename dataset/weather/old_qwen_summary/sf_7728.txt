Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before dropping sharply in the late evening, which may signal a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained low during the night, with brief bursts in the late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a transition period, likely bringing foggy, damp conditions in the morning and potentially clearing skies later, with a possible shift toward more stable, drier air.
