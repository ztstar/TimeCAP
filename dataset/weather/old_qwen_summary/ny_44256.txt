Temperature trends indicate a significant overnight cooldown, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, which may point to a drying air mass moving in. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the morning, reaching a peak before slightly declining, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that has since begun to weaken. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, potentially signaling a shift in wind patterns associated with an approaching weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing winds suggests a drying and potentially unstable air mass, which could precede changing conditions such as possible storms or a shift in the prevailing weather pattern.
