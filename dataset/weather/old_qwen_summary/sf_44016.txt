Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is characteristic of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the night but showed a slight decline followed by a modest increase in the afternoon, indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions that may signal changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were low overnight, increasing in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, reflecting dynamic local circulation. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer event, with fog and cool temperatures likely affecting visibility and comfort, especially in coastal neighborhoods.
