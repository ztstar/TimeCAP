Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly during midday, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period, with a slight increase during midday, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly during the late morning and afternoon, hinting at a change in air mass or the onset of local circulation patterns. The combination of high humidity and fluctuating wind patterns may elevate discomfort levels and could support the development of isolated thunderstorms later in the day if instability increases.
