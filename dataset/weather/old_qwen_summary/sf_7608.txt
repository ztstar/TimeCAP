Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed a sharp drop during midday, followed by a marked increase in the evening, suggesting the influence of nocturnal fog formation and clearing. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the late evening, which may be linked to the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially stabilizing conditions and reducing the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day, with a brief but strong increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, possibly signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cooler, fog-prone period to a drier, more stable phase, with implications for visibility, comfort, and local microclimates.
