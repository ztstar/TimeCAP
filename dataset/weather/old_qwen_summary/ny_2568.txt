Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A marked decrease in air pressure coincided with the onset of the cold front, stabilizing afterward as the system passed through, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight period, with sustained gusts from the southeast and later shifting to the southwest, consistent with storm dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from mild, humid conditions to cooler, drier, and more stable air, likely resulting in clearer skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
