Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels reached saturation (100%) during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or mist formation, which is typical for the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a shift from southerly to westerly directions, which likely contributed to the damp, cool conditions and the persistence of fog. The combination of near-saturation humidity, low wind, and cooling temperatures points to a strong marine layer influence, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic foggy mornings.
