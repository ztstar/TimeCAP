Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly. A pronounced increase in humidity occurred during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, culminating in a marked drop during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind conditions remained light and variable through the night, but intensified from mid-morning onward, with strong southerly to westerly winds developing, suggesting a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors point to a transition toward potentially overcast and damp conditions, with increased chances of coastal fog and breezy conditions in the coming hours.
