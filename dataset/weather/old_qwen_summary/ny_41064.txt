Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, then dropped significantly as temperatures climbed and winds intensified. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend during the night and early morning, indicating a possible low-pressure influence that may have contributed to increased cloud cover and damp conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest, suggesting a change in air mass and the potential for clearing skies. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and stronger, more variable winds points to the dissipation of overnight moisture and a transition toward a drier, more stable afternoon and evening.
