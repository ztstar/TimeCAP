Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply dropping during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist marine layer to drier, inland air. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a slow recovery, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or a shift in regional atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and eventually to westerly, consistent with changing pressure gradients and possible onshore breezes. These combined trends point to a dynamic coastal weather pattern, likely driven by marine layer development and dissipation, with implications for visibility, fog formation, and afternoon temperature increases.
