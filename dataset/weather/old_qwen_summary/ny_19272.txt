Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift in thermal conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking before declining sharply in the late morning, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early night, reaching a minimum before rebounding, which may signal the influence of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a consistent wind direction from the northwest, indicating a prevailing flow from that quadrant. These combined signals point to the arrival of a dynamic weather front, likely bringing changing conditions, including possible precipitation or clearing skies in the near term.
