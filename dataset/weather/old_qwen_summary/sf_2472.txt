Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching peak values during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to dense fog formation, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas. Air pressure showed notable increases during the evening and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions later in the period. Wind speeds were generally low, especially during the early morning, but picked up in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting a change in airflow patterns likely related to coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a transition from foggy, moist conditions to clearer, more stable air, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the overnight to midday cycle.
