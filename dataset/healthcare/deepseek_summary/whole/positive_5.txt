Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both Influenza A and B positivity rates increasing sharply in recent months. The proportion of positive specimens has risen from low levels to a peak in the most recent weeks, indicating widespread community circulation of the virus. Influenza A has consistently driven the increase in positivity, accounting for the majority of cases, though Influenza B has also shown significant and sustained growth. A notable decline in positivity rates occurred in the most recent weeks, suggesting a potential plateau or early downturn in the current wave. These trends highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance, preparedness for continued transmission, and targeted public health interventions to mitigate impact.
