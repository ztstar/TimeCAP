Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining through the day, suggesting a moist air mass was present and subsequently advected out. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and into the afternoon, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, which correlates with the movement of the high-pressure system and a transition toward clearer skies. These combined trends point to a developing pattern of fair weather with decreasing moisture and improving air stability, reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
