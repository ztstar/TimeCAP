Temperature trends show a steady decline overnight, followed by a gradual recovery during the day, indicating a cold night with a warming afternoon. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping, suggesting overnight moisture accumulation and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained stable during the night, then rose sharply in the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were low overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which may indicate changing air masses. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cooler, damp night to a clearer, breezier day, consistent with the influence of an approaching high-pressure system.
