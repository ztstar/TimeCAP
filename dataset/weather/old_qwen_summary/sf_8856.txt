Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from cool, moist conditions to drier, warmer air. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained minimal until late afternoon, when they increased notably, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly and westerly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors suggest the onset of a shifting weather regime, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation in the coming hours.
