Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as daylight returned. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period in the mid-morning and late evening, though brief bursts of moderate wind occurred earlier in the night. The shifting wind directions, particularly from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflect dynamic airflow changes possibly associated with coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale patterns typical of the region’s microclimate.
