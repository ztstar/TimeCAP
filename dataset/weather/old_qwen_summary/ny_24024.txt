Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by clear skies and minimal cloud cover. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight and pre-dawn hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of dew formation or fog, potentially leading to reduced visibility in the early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred multiple times during the night and early morning, accompanied by fluctuating wind speeds and shifting wind directions, pointing to transient weather systems or frontal passages affecting the region. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, likely due to a developing low-pressure influence or thermal wind effects. These combined conditions imply a transition in weather patterns, with potential for unstable air, increased cloud development, and possible precipitation later in the day.
