Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and mist, particularly during the period of minimal wind. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions, though it began to fluctuate slightly later in the day. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a complete calm during the peak humidity period, but increased in the afternoon, likely driven by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, which may influence afternoon thunderstorm potential as the day progresses.
