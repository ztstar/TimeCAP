Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before stabilizing in the mid-morning hours. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight period, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that has since stabilized, suggesting improving and drier conditions ahead. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the southeast and later shifts to more variable directions, signaling atmospheric instability and possible localized convective activity. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a potential for isolated thunderstorms or showers in the coming hours, especially as daytime heating resumes.
