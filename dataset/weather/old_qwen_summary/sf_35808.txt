Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds during the night. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were highest during the early morning and decreased significantly overnight, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a marine-influenced, foggy night to a progressively clearer and more stable afternoon, consistent with typical San Francisco coastal weather dynamics.
