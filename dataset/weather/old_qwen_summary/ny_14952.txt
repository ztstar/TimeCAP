Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooling overnight and warming during daylight hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of overnight moisture accumulation, likely due to cooling air reaching dew point. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop toward the end of the period, particularly in the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind patterns were generally light and variable, with brief periods of calm and shifts in direction, including a notable shift from southerly to northerly and then easterly winds, which may indicate changing frontal influences. Combined, these trends suggest a transition in weather, with the potential for increasing cloud cover, possible precipitation, and cooler conditions later in the day.
