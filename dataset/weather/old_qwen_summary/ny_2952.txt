Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent decline, reaching a low point before gradually rising, indicating a cold night followed by a slight warming trend. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early morning hours but surged significantly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting increasing moisture in the air, possibly due to a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a sharp and sustained increase starting in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds were variable, with a notable reduction during early morning hours and a resurgence in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast, which may indicate a change in atmospheric flow. Together, these indicators suggest that a cold, dry, and stable air mass has moved into the region, likely resulting in clear skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
