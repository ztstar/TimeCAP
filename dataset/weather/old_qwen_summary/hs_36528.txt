Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and solar heating. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early hours coincided with a marked increase in humidity and wind speeds, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and then to variable, with a notable surge in wind speed late in the evening, potentially signaling the arrival of a storm system or gust front. The sustained high humidity levels, particularly in the overnight and early morning periods, contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased potential for thunderstorm development. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic weather transition, with increased instability and the likelihood of convective activity in the coming hours.
