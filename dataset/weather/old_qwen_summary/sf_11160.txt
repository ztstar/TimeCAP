Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during daylight hours, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels exhibited sharp fluctuations, with repeated spikes during nighttime hours, likely due to marine layer formation, while daytime values remained consistently low, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, peaking around midday, which may reflect the influence of a high-pressure system stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind patterns were generally light and variable, with a significant shift in direction during the late afternoon and early evening, potentially signaling a change in synoptic flow. These conditions suggest a transition from a cooler, humid marine layer to a drier, more stable air mass, consistent with a clearing pattern that could lead to improved visibility and comfortable daytime conditions.
