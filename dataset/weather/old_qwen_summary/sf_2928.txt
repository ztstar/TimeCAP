Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike in the pre-dawn and early morning hours, suggesting dense fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the night before a gradual decline in the late afternoon, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, likely signaling the onset of onshore breezes typical of the region’s coastal dynamics. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the final hours suggests a possible break in the prevailing marine layer, which could lead to clearer skies and more stable conditions later tonight.
