Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by atmospheric instability. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure peaked in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a notable dip during the transition period, signaling possible frontal influences or localized storm development. Wind speeds increased substantially during the evening, particularly in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and southwesterly, which may indicate the arrival of a developing disturbance. These combined patterns suggest increasing potential for thunderstorm activity later in the day, especially given the convergence of high humidity, rising temperatures, and gusty winds.
