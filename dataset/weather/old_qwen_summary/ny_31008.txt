Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase in the early hours, indicating possible moisture accumulation, which later dropped dramatically during midday, suggesting dry air advection. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the influence of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds gradually increased in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the northeast and east, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that suggests a change in air mass flow. These patterns point to a transition from a cooler, humid morning to a drier, warmer afternoon, consistent with a clearing trend under the influence of a persistent high-pressure ridge.
