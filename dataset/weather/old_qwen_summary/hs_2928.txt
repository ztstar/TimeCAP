Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime air. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the midday to early evening period, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increasing temperatures and changing wind patterns. A notable decline in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a sustained low-pressure trend, which may signal the approach of a weather system or storm activity. Wind speeds increased significantly in the evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with the development of a frontal passage. These combined factors suggest an evolving weather pattern, potentially leading to unstable conditions, including the possibility of thunderstorms later in the night or early morning.
