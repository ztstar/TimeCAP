Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, possibly indicating a change in air mass. These combined factors point toward a transition from a humid, unstable night into a drier, more stable day, with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
