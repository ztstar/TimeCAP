Temperature showed a steady decline during the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, suggesting a period of saturation followed by drying. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased substantially in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, increasing winds, and a shift in wind direction suggests the onset of a drier, cooler air mass, which may lead to clearer skies and improved weather conditions later in the day.
