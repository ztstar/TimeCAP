Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting increased moisture availability during nighttime and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a general upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were relatively low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the west and northwest, possibly indicating a change in air mass. These conditions together suggest a transition from a humid, stable overnight environment to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for isolated showers if moisture continues to accumulate.
