Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the onset of a drying trend likely due to increased wind and solar heating. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest during midday points to a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to a passing pressure system. Air pressure rose sharply in the early morning hours, reaching a peak before stabilizing, which may indicate the influence of a high-pressure ridge building in from the Pacific. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and humid maritime environment to a drier and windier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
