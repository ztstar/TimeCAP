Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooldown during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a minor fluctuation in the late afternoon, hinting at subtle changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation. Wind speeds were low and consistent during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, which may signal the influence of a developing sea breeze or approaching weather system. These patterns suggest a transition toward potentially unsettled conditions, with lower humidity and increasing wind speeds potentially setting the stage for convective activity later in the day.
