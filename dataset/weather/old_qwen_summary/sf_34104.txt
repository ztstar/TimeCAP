Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting the dissipation of low-level fog. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, weakening in the pre-dawn hours before gradually increasing again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from west to north and then to the northeast, indicating changing synoptic influences. Overall, the data suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, warmer weather, consistent with a typical San Francisco coastal pattern under a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
