Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained high overnight, dropping sharply in the mid-morning before stabilizing at lower values, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog and a transition to clearer conditions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system enhancing atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable lull around midday, followed by a rebound in the late afternoon, likely due to localized sea breeze development. Wind direction shifted dramatically from coastal to onshore and then to offshore, reflecting changing pressure gradients and the influence of the Bay Area’s topography on airflow patterns.
