Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise during the midday and early evening, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies. Wind activity was generally light overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a warmer, drier afternoon, consistent with typical coastal fog dissipation and afternoon wind surge patterns in the region.
