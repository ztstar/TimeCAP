Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the day, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and possible fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-to-late night, culminating in a sustained high-pressure ridge that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a shift from variable to more consistent easterly and southeasterly flow in the morning, likely reinforcing coastal fog and cool conditions. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and stable pressure suggests persistent marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy conditions during the early morning hours.
