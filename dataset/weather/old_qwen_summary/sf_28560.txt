Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially in the early to mid-period, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city's coastal climate. Air pressure showed a sharp increase in the late evening, followed by a rapid decline overnight, pointing to the passage of a strong weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the early morning, with strong southerly and easterly flows, potentially bringing in marine air and contributing to the temperature drop. The shift in wind direction toward the west and north in the final hours indicates the arrival of a changing air mass, possibly signaling a shift toward clearer, drier conditions in the coming hours.
