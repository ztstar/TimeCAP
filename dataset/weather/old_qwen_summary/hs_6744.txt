Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the midday, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more convective regime. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the night, stabilizing at a high value before a slight drop in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to a more variable direction, with a notable increase in speed and a change in origin during the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined changes suggest the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as warming and moisture reaccumulation occur, warranting weather vigilance in the coming hours.
