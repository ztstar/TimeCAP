Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, particularly during the early hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with consistent northerly and westerly flows during the night and early morning, shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon, possibly due to local circulation changes. The combination of cooling temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing pressure points to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable weather, though localized gusts and changing wind directions could signal evolving atmospheric dynamics.
