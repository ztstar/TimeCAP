Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A gradual decline in air pressure throughout the day suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially signaling unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with periods of calm and brief increases, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the southwest, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to the possibility of precipitation later in the day, especially given the high humidity and falling pressure, which could impact commuting and outdoor activities.
