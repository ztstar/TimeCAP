Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant overnight cooling phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the same period, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests fog formation or dense low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s coastal microclimate. Air pressure showed a sharp decline in the middle of the night, followed by a rapid recovery, indicating the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system that brought moist, unstable air. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more westerly direction overnight, with calm conditions at dawn, potentially signaling the influence of a marine layer settling in. These combined conditions point to a classic San Francisco fog event, with potential for reduced visibility and cooler, damp conditions persisting into the next day.
