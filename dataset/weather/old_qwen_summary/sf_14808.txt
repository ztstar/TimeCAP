Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rebounding in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating strong moisture accumulation, likely due to marine influence and fog formation. A notable pressure spike occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a sharp drop during the night, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions and increased precipitation potential. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night but strengthened in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in air mass and possible onshore flow. These combined factors point to a period of coastal fog, damp conditions, and dynamic atmospheric transitions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
