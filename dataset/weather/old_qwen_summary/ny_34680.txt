Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a notable overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, particularly around dawn. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase over the period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has brought stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a shift toward stronger and more variable winds in the afternoon and evening, likely due to changing pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly and then easterly, signaling a change in airflow that may precede a shift in weather patterns, potentially bringing cooler and drier air later in the day.
