Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, warmer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, which may signal the approach of a boundary or change in airflow. These conditions point to a transition phase where residual moisture from the night gave way to drier air, potentially setting the stage for a more stable and sunny day ahead.
