Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a steady rise in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a diurnal pattern typical of coastal areas influenced by marine layer dynamics. Air pressure steadily increased through the early and mid-day hours before declining in the evening, signaling a transition from stable high-pressure dominance to a weakening system that may allow for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, reflecting a change in atmospheric circulation that could signal the approach of a new air mass. These combined factors suggest a coastal weather regime characterized by a persistent marine layer, with potential for foggy conditions and shifting wind patterns that may influence local microclimates and air quality.
