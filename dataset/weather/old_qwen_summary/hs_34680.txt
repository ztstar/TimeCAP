Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady temperature recovery through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, reaching saturation at multiple points, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation, which may have persisted into the early morning. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, potentially signaling the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions and sustained high moisture, these conditions suggest a heightened risk of thunderstorms in the coming hours, particularly if instability continues to build.
