Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred overnight, followed by a steady rise during the day, indicating a transition from a cold night to a warming afternoon. Humidity levels declined sharply through the early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing, suggesting a drying trend followed by moistening as temperatures rose. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning hours, culminating in a sharp rebound, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest, potentially bringing cooler, drier air and clearing skies. The combination of rising temperatures, increasing humidity, and stable high pressure points to improving conditions and the likelihood of clearer skies in the near term.
