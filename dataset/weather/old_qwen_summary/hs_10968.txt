Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift from a cooler, stable period to a more moderate and potentially unstable phase. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with periods of high moisture early in the cycle and a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting possible drying out of the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady rise, particularly during the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including a prominent southerly component, which may have contributed to the mixing of air masses. These combined patterns suggest a transition period with potential for developing convection, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms if moisture re-enters the system.
