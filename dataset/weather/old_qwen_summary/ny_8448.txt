Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, and then plummeted during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp decline, which is indicative of a passing frontal system that brought stormy conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that shifted slightly toward the west-southwest in the evening, likely influencing the movement of the pressure system. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic weather transition, potentially leading to unsettled conditions later in the day with possible showers or storms.
