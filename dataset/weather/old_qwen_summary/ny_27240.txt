Temperature trends indicate a gradual cooling overnight, followed by a steady rise through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the onset of a warming period. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, dropping significantly as temperatures increased, signaling a transition from damp conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early hours, followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a more stable high-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning before tapering off, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and then veering to a northerly flow, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest that New York City experienced a shift from a moist, cool, and unstable air mass to a drier and more stable regime, likely leading to clearer skies and improved conditions in the coming hours.
