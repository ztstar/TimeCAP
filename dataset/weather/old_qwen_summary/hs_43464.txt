Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation at multiple points, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before increasing steadily in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during nighttime hours, with a shift toward more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly suggests a reorganization of circulation patterns, potentially indicating the beginning of a front passage or sea breeze development.
