Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying due to increased temperatures and wind. Air pressure showed fluctuating patterns, with a notable drop in the late night and early morning, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with shifting directions indicating dynamic airflow, possibly linked to a developing circulation or local breeze systems. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions conducive to instability and potential for afternoon thunderstorms as heat and moisture reaccumulate.
