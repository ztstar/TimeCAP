Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a notable cooling event likely driven by a front or storm system. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours and then sharply declined, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass after a period of saturated conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system moving in and stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds intensified, particularly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic patterns and possible front passage. These combined indicators suggest the influence of a strong cold front that has moved through the region, bringing cooler, drier air and clearing skies—setting the stage for improved weather conditions in the coming hours.
