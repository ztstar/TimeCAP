Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the late morning and afternoon, indicating the onset of a warming trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity remained near saturation levels throughout most of the period, suggesting persistent moist conditions conducive to fog or light precipitation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp increase in the midday hours, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts, while wind direction shifted dramatically—particularly in the late afternoon—indicating possible storm development or frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a dynamic and potentially unstable atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of developing showers or thunderstorms in the coming hours.
