Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler to a warmer phase. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining high through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of a moist air mass. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline in the late night and early morning, stabilizing afterward, which may reflect the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light through most of the period, with slight increases in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions, implying shifting airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, likely involving the passage of a frontal system, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
