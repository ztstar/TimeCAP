Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a notable cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or mist formation. A sharp increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by sustained high pressure, signaling the arrival of a stable, high-pressure system that typically brings calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds decreased steadily throughout the day, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation likely associated with the high-pressure buildup. Overall, the data points to a transition toward more stable and dry weather, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and improving visibility during the coming hours.
