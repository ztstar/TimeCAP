Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and northerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more dynamic atmosphere, which could influence the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
