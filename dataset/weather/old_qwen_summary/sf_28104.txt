Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low clouds that likely formed as air cooled to dew point. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, with notable spikes associated with the arrival of high-pressure systems that may have influenced the clearing of fog and stabilization of conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from southerly to westerly and then to strong northerly flows, which likely contributed to the advection of cooler marine air and the dissipation of fog. These dynamics point to a typical coastal weather pattern driven by the interaction of maritime air, temperature inversions, and shifting pressure systems.
