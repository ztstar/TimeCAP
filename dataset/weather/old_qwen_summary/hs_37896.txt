Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late night and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation, which then declined sharply during the day, indicating drying conditions. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours, before falling again in the late evening—a pattern often associated with approaching weather systems. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west sectors, potentially signaling the influence of a developing frontal boundary. Combined, these trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, with increasing instability and possible convective activity later in the day.
