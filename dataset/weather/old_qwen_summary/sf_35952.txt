Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. A marked increase in relative humidity to near saturation levels during the early hours suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, likely driven by marine air intrusion. Air pressure dropped sharply during the night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the cooler temperatures and increased moisture. Wind patterns showed variability, with shifts from coastal onshore flow to more variable and sometimes weak winds, suggesting changing synoptic influences. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and fluctuating pressure points to a maritime influence with potential for persistent fog and overcast conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
