Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily into the early morning, peaking at very high values, suggesting dense fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly occurred during the night, indicating a change in air mass, possibly associated with the arrival of a marine layer or an approaching weather front. Air pressure showed a complex pattern, with a rise during the night followed by a sharp decline, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system influencing coastal conditions. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, variable wind patterns, and fluctuating pressure—point to the presence of a dynamic marine influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for fog and cooler, damp conditions persisting into the coming hours.
