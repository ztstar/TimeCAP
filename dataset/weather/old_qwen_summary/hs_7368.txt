Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels surged overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, potentially impacting visibility and comfort. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-morning, followed by a sharp rise, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearing conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, with a sudden increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest, indicating a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more active daytime regime, with potential for improved conditions as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
