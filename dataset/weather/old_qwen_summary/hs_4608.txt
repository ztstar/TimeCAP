Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high through the night and early morning, then sharply decreased during the day, indicating a drying trend likely due to increasing solar heating and wind influence. Air pressure showed a gradual rise through the night, peaking midday before declining, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by the approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and midday, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to more variable and southerly, which may signal changing upper-level flow or the onset of a frontal influence. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more stable, warmer conditions, but with potential for developing afternoon convection later in the day.
