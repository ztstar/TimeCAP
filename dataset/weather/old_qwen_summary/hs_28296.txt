Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler night into a warming day. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could lead to fog or dew formation in the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings more stable and clearer conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with strong easterly and southerly flows during the day, potentially transporting moisture inland and contributing to the elevated humidity. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and variable wind direction increases the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly as the atmosphere becomes more unstable in the late afternoon.
