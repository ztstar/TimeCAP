Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or low visibility. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late morning, signaling possible approaching weather changes. Wind speed was low and consistent overnight, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in airflow that may precede a front. Combined with the rising temperature and falling pressure, these trends suggest a transition toward potentially unsettled weather later in the day.
