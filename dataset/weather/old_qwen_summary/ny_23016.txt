Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating the presence of a persistent low-level moisture layer. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely contributed to the overcast and moist conditions. Wind speeds were light and variable, with a shift toward southerly and then westerly directions in the late evening, suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a weather pattern conducive to precipitation, with potential for rain or drizzle in the near term.
