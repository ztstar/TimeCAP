Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a sharp drop in the late night, indicating a transition from a warm day to cooler conditions. Humidity remained high through the early morning hours, peaking in the overnight period, before rapidly declining in the early morning, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increasing wind activity. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late afternoon, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or frontal passage. Wind speed increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with a developing low-pressure system influencing the region. The shift in wind direction from the east to the southwest and then westward suggests the approach of a frontal boundary, raising the potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
