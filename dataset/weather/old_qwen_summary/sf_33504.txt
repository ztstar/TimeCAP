Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the mid-afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may indicate the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly from the northwest, contributing to enhanced mixing and dispersion of moisture. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy morning to a clearer, warmer afternoon, consistent with typical coastal weather patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics and regional pressure changes.
