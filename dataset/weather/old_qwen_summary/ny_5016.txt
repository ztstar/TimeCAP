Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the early hours but increased significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking before dropping again as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, indicating an approaching low-pressure system, which often brings unstable weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts increasing from light to strong, particularly from the southeast and south, suggesting a developing storm influence. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to southeasterly aligns with frontal passage dynamics, pointing to a likely change in weather conditions, potentially including precipitation, in the near future.
