Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which supports the presence of fog and low clouds common in the region during this time of year. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased wind speeds, suggesting the approach of a weather system. Wind direction changed dramatically from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, indicating a complex interaction between onshore flow and upper-level influences. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and weakening winds in the last few hours points to a clearing trend, likely signaling the dissipation of fog and improved visibility.
