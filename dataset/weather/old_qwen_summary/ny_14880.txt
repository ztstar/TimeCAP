Over the past 24 hours, a noticeable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating a saturated atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog or mist. A significant drop in air pressure in the early hours coincided with the onset of wind activity and shifting wind directions, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the southwest and west, indicating a dynamic atmospheric setup. The recent rise in pressure and stabilization of wind patterns suggest the system is moving out, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions by the coming day.
