Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at 100% and remaining elevated, which suggests the presence of fog or mist and increased dampness. Air pressure exhibited a significant increase in the late afternoon, particularly during the evening hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained low and steady throughout the night, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting possible changes in air mass movement. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting winds implies that current conditions are transitioning from a damp, stable night phase toward clearer, more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
