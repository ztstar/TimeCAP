Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回升, indicating a nighttime cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation possibly linked to a shallow boundary layer or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor drop in the late night, followed by a slight recovery, which may reflect the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a change in air mass. Wind speeds increased during the early morning and again in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction from northwest to northeast, indicating changing flow patterns possibly associated with a frontal influence. The combination of high humidity, rising temperature, and shifting winds suggests potential for fog dissipation in the coming hours, with a moderate risk of light precipitation if moisture continues to accumulate.
