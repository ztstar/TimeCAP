Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of cold temperatures, with a steady decline followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels remained consistently low, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air masses were dominant, likely enhancing the perceived chill. Air pressure steadily increased, peaking toward the end of the period, which is characteristic of improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system.

These combined factors point to a transitioning weather pattern, with cold, dry, and stable air now prevailing, likely leading to clear skies and cooler conditions in the immediate forecast.
