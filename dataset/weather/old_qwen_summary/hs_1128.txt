Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady and significant warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively high throughout the period, with a slight increase during the early morning and a gradual decline toward the end, suggesting the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest the approach of a warm, dry air mass, potentially setting the stage for a heatwave or reduced chance of precipitation in the coming hours.
