Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of high moisture and sudden spikes that coincided with wind shifts, suggesting possible convective activity. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, which may have contributed to the dispersion of moisture and the development of localized showers. The wind direction showed a shift from predominantly northerly to more variable and southerly, consistent with a change in air mass and potential storm development. Overall, these indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, with increased instability and the likelihood of short-term precipitation events.
