Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise in temperature through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating saturated air conditions, which likely contributed to a persistent mist or fog during the night. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought increased moisture and unstable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts and shifting directions, particularly from the southwest and west, signaling active atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a developing weather system, potentially bringing thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
