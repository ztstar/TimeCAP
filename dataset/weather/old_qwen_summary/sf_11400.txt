Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained low during the midday and late afternoon, suggesting dry conditions, but surged significantly during the early morning hours, likely due to fog formation or marine layer development. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, peaking in the early morning, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system enhancing stability and clearing skies. Wind speeds remained consistently light, with minimal variability, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to more easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns across the bay and coastal region. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a foggy, cool coastal environment to a clearer, warmer day, with potential for increased visibility and stable conditions in the coming hours.
