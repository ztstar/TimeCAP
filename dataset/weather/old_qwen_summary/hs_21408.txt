Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of near-saturation humidity, with values consistently near or at maximum levels, indicating a high moisture content in the atmosphere. Temperature trends show a gradual rise during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting increasing thermal energy accumulation, which may promote convective activity. Air pressure exhibited minor fluctuations, with a brief drop followed by stabilization, signaling a relatively stable but evolving atmospheric regime. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, consistent with a developing low-level inflow pattern favorable for storm development. These combined conditions suggest a heightened potential for thunderstorms, particularly during the evening and overnight hours, as moisture, instability, and lift align.
