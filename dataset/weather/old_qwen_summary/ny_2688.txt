Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a cold front. Air pressure rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking before declining, which is consistent with the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions. Humidity levels increased notably overnight, reaching a peak before tapering off, suggesting moisture accumulation during the cooler hours. Wind speeds diminished through the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, then picked up again in the afternoon with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These trends collectively point to a transition from cold, dry, and stable conditions to a more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for changing weather later in the day.
