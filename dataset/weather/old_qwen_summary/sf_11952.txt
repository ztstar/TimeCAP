Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high, with prolonged periods of near-saturated conditions, indicating a persistent marine influence and potential for fog formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the early morning, peaking in the midday hours before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overnight, dropping to near calm during the early morning hours, but began to increase again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, hinting at a change in airflow patterns. These dynamics point to a transition likely driven by coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale changes, which could lead to developing fog or overcast conditions in the coming hours.
