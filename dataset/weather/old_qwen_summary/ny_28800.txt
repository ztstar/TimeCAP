Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity spiked to saturation levels during the early morning hours, suggesting fog or dew formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility. Air pressure dropped significantly overnight, particularly in the early hours, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought overcast conditions and precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast and later to more easterly and southerly sectors, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest the influence of a developing storm system, with potential for unsettled weather in the near term.
