Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking above 90% in the early hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for precipitation. Air pressure consistently declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is characteristic of an approaching or passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the southwest and west, possibly contributing to the mixing of air and the development of unstable conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to southerly again, combined with the observed pressure and humidity trends, points to dynamic atmospheric changes that may have led to brief periods of rain or drizzle, especially during the overnight hours.
