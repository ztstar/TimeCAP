Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures declining steadily during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred in the early hours, followed by a period of stable pressure, indicating possible passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind conditions were generally light and variable overnight, with a brief but strong gust from the southwest in the early morning, followed by a shift to more easterly and southerly flows later in the day. These conditions point to a transition period marked by fog development and shifting wind patterns, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and may signal ongoing coastal influence with potential for lingering fog in the coming hours.
