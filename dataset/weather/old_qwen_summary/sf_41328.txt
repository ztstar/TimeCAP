Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining through the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels displayed a dramatic shift, beginning high and remaining elevated through the early hours before plummeting significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a dry air mass. Air pressure remained generally stable but saw a notable increase during the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the south and west, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to northeasterly in the final hours suggests a change in air mass, possibly signaling the approach of a new weather pattern affecting the region.
