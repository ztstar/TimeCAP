Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle, which aligns with the observed wind calm and low wind speeds. A notable increase in air pressure during the early morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to stable conditions and reduced wind activity. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southerly direction to more variable, including easterly and northerly flows, particularly in the late night and early morning, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The return of stronger winds and a rise in temperature later in the day indicate the beginning of a transition, possibly clearing the fog and bringing more stable, drier conditions.
