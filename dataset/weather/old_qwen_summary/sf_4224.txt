Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during early morning hours and dropping during midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent dissipation. A notable spike in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, which likely corresponded to a transient high-pressure system enhancing stability and reducing cloud cover. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly northerly and westerly flows to a brief period of calm and then a resurgence of easterly and southerly winds, hinting at dynamic synoptic changes and possible onshore flow. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, fog-prone marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, setting the stage for clearer skies and potentially warmer conditions in the coming hours.
