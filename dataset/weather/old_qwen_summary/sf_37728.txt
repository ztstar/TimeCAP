Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cold, stable night to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the night and early morning, suggesting condensation or fog formation, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure showed a highly variable pattern, with several sharp drops and temporary increases, signaling the passage of multiple weather systems, including a low-pressure disturbance that may have brought instability. Wind activity was inconsistent, with strong gusts in the early morning and late evening, particularly from the southwest and southeast, likely enhancing coastal cooling and mixing of air masses. Overall, the combination of high humidity, shifting wind directions, and fluctuating pressure points to an active coastal weather environment, potentially increasing the risk of fog and brief, localized precipitation events.
