Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating the influence of a nocturnal cooling phase and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping during the afternoon, then surging again in the evening—suggesting possible moisture influx or localized convection. Air pressure showed a notable increase during midday, peaking sharply in the afternoon before declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a possible change in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained low overnight and in the morning, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating a change in airflow dynamics. These combined trends suggest the approach of a developing weather system, possibly bringing instability and increased chances of thunderstorms later in the day.
