Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, contributing to a damp, foggy atmosphere, before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, indicating a clearing trend. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger winds from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with coastal upwelling and sea breeze dynamics. These conditions point to a transition from a cool, foggy coastal environment to a drier, breezier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
