Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before gradually declining into the night and early morning hours, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, reaching saturation and remaining consistently high, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the night and early morning, followed by a slight drop in the late afternoon, consistent with a weak pressure gradient and subdued atmospheric instability. Wind speeds diminished to near calm conditions during the early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to west-southwest, reflecting the influence of coastal dynamics and the marine layer. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer and foggy conditions overnight, which have likely led to cool, damp mornings and a gradual clearing during the afternoon as winds increase and pressure stabilizes.
