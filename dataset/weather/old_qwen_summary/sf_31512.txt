Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly from midday onward, suggesting the approach or presence of a stable high-pressure system that would bring drier and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures overnight, and increasing pressure suggests a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer skies and more stable weather in the coming hours.
