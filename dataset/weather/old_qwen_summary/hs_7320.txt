Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, followed by a steady decline as temperatures increased. Air pressure exhibited a notable dip during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather front, likely associated with a cold front or low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from gentle, southerly flows in the early hours to more variable and stronger winds later in the day, with a strong shift toward the northwest and west, indicating changing atmospheric circulation. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds implies a period of unstable weather, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or brief showers, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours.
