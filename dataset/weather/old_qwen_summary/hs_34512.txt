Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially in the night and early morning, indicating persistent atmospheric moisture. Air pressure showed a mix of stability and sharp drops, particularly during midday, suggesting the passage of a weather system that may have brought intermittent showers. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong gust observed, paired with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and westerly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions together suggest a developing or passing front, increasing the likelihood of localized storms or heavy rain later in the day.
