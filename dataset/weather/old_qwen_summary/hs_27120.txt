Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests possible clearing or a change in air mass. A notable spike in air pressure occurred in the late night, followed by a sharp decline and subsequent recovery, signaling the passage of a weather front or system. Wind speeds were generally low during the early hours, increasing in the late night and early morning, with a pronounced shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly and then to easterly, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These combined indicators point to the influence of a passing cold front that brought cooler, drier air, potentially leading to improved conditions and a reduction in humidity and cloud cover in the coming hours.
