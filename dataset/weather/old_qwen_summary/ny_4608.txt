Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a noticeable dampness in the air. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, especially from the east and southeast, potentially indicating a shift in airflow. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and a gradual warming trend suggests that the city is transitioning into a more stable, dry, and possibly breezy weather pattern.
