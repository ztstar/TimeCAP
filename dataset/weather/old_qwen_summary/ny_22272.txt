Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with cooler conditions overnight. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, suggesting the presence of a drying trend during the day. Air pressure steadily decreased through the afternoon and early evening, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may indicate the influence of a passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions overnight to more variable and potentially unsettled weather in the coming hours.
