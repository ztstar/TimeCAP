Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler marine influence to increasing daytime heating. Humidity levels remained low during the day before sharply increasing in the evening, suggesting the onset of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the afternoon, culminating in a notable drop toward the end of the period, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in weather conditions. Wind patterns shifted from westerly to easterly and then to variable directions, with a noticeable increase in speed and a change in direction in the late evening, possibly indicating the influence of a developing onshore flow or frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic weather transition, with the potential for fog, cooler temperatures, and changing wind conditions in the near term.
