Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during daylight hours, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels showed a pronounced surge during the early morning and overnight hours, particularly around dawn, suggesting fog formation and increased moisture retention near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no evidence of a strong weather system passing through, but consistent high pressure likely contributed to the stable, dry conditions during midday. Wind patterns were highly variable, with periods of calm interspersed with brief bursts of moderate winds, particularly from the west and south, which may have influenced the movement of fog and coastal air masses. The combination of cooling temperatures overnight, high humidity, and variable wind shifts points to the presence of marine layer dynamics, a hallmark of San Francisco’s weather, potentially leading to foggy mornings and clear, mild afternoons.
