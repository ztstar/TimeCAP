Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Humidity levels exhibited a marked spike in the early night, remaining consistently high through the middle of the night before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden front. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the early hours, peaking midday, then a sharp decline, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light until midday, with a noticeable increase in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with the arrival of warmer, moist air. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, likely associated with a frontal passage that could lead to precipitation or storm development in the coming hours.
