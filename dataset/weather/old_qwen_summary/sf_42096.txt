Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual daytime warming, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a milder afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before declining slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting the possible approach of a weakening weather system. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a shift to stronger and more variable winds in the evening, particularly from the east and southeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Combined, these patterns suggest a coastal fog event driven by marine air intrusion, followed by a gradual clearing and warming trend as offshore winds increased toward evening.
