Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern. Humidity levels surged dramatically after midday, reaching near-saturation conditions that contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during nighttime hours. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, which may indicate a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions collectively point to a stable, warm, and humid environment—favorable for potential thunderstorm development if moisture and lift increase further.
