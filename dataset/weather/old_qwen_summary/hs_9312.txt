Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early evening, peaking during the night and early morning hours before plummeting in the mid-to-late morning, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that later dissipated. Air pressure showed a notable increase overnight, reaching a peak before a sharp decline in the early morning, which may signal the arrival of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a change in air mass and potential storm development. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a heightened risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
