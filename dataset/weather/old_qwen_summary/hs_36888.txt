Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increased solar exposure and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon and evening, reaching its lowest point before stabilizing, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the evening, peaking during the night, with strong, shifting winds from multiple directions—particularly from the southwest and west—indicating dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined factors suggest the potential for developing convective activity, increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms or heavy rainfall, especially if moisture levels remain elevated.
