Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure showed a steady increase during the early hours, peaking in the midday, then gradually declining, signaling a possible weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with a shift from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly directions, which may indicate the influence of a developing sea breeze or approaching weather system. The combination of rising temperatures, dropping humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable, potentially clearer conditions, though lingering moisture could support isolated afternoon thunderstorms.
