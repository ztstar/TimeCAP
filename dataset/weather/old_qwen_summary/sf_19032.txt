Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night before stabilizing in the morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low stratus clouds, typical of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds decreased substantially overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, reflecting a change in atmospheric flow that may influence coastal ventilation. These conditions collectively point to a period of persistent fog and cool, calm weather, typical of San Francisco’s coastal influence, with limited wind and high moisture levels likely affecting visibility and outdoor comfort.
