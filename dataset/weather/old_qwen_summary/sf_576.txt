Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion and condensation processes. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach and stabilization of a high-pressure system, which generally brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with calm periods and variable direction, but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, likely due to thermal gradients and local topography. These patterns collectively point to a transition from cool, moist conditions to warmer, drier air, consistent with a typical San Francisco afternoon transition and favorable for clear skies and mild weather in the coming hours.
