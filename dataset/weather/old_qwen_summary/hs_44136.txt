Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, remaining elevated through the early morning before steadily declining into the afternoon, suggesting a period of stable air mass with potential for fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, peaking in the late afternoon, which signals the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, typically associated with stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with directional shifts indicating a change in airflow, possibly due to local convection or synoptic-scale influences. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds in the evening suggests improving conditions, with a transition toward drier and more stable air, reducing the likelihood of precipitation.
