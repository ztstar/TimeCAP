Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual increase in the morning and afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cooling trend. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred midday, signaling the passage of a weather front, potentially linked to the onset of changing conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition period, possibly bringing overcast skies or light precipitation later in the day.
