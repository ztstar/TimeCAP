Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture that likely contributed to reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind direction occurred mid-morning, transitioning from westerly to easterly and southerly flows, which may signal the influence of a changing pressure system or coastal dynamics. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief period of calm conditions around sunrise, suggesting limited atmospheric mixing during the night. The gradual decrease in air pressure throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon, suggests an approaching weather system, potentially bringing more unstable or precipitation-prone conditions.
