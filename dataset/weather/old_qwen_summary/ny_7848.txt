Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by a passing weather front. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the night, peaking in the early hours before plummeting, suggesting a shift from moist to drier air, possibly due to a change in air mass. Air pressure rose sharply in the early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover later in the day. Wind patterns revealed a shift from northerly to more southeasterly directions, accompanied by increased gusts during the night, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of falling temperatures, rapid humidity changes, and pressure shifts points to a dynamic weather transition that may have brought brief precipitation or fog, with improving conditions expected in the coming hours.
