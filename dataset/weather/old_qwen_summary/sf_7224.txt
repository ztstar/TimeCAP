Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind activity was generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest during the night, which may have contributed to the cooling and moisture buildup. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and calm winds points to a transition toward a more settled and potentially foggy morning, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns.
