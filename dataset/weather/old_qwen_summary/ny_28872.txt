Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, starting high and dropping sharply during midday before rising again, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop followed by a recovery, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, peaking with strong gusts from the northwest, which aligns with the development of a vigorous weather front. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a cold air advection pattern, reinforcing the potential for colder, drier air moving in and possibly leading to precipitation or clearing skies.
