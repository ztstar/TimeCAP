Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels spiked in the early morning hours before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as temperatures rose and air masses stabilized. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure influence that has suppressed significant weather changes. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong, consistent winds from the southwest, likely driven by a coastal pressure gradient and enhanced by the city’s topography. These conditions together suggest a transition from foggy, cool mornings to clearer, breezier afternoons—consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate and the ongoing influence of the Pacific Ocean.
