Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures reaching a minimum during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking during the hours of lowest temperature, indicating a significant increase in moisture content likely due to condensation or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly during the afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. This combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and shifting winds points to improving weather conditions and a transition toward drier, more stable air.
