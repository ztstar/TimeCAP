Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine air intrusion. Humidity levels showed extreme fluctuations, with near-saturation conditions during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, followed by drying trends during the day, typical of coastal fog cycles. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline toward the end of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the overnight hours, particularly from the northwest, aligning with the onset of a coastal breeze or frontal passage, while wind directions shifted from dominant west to northeast, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These indicators collectively point to an active weather transition, with potential for foggy mornings, breezy conditions, and possible precipitation later in the day.
