Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Temperature trends showed a steady rise during the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, indicating a diurnal heating pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase in the early morning and again in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture influx or localized convective activity. Wind patterns revealed a shift from light, easterly winds to stronger, more variable winds in the afternoon, including brief gusts from the southwest and west, which may have contributed to instability. These combined conditions—falling pressure, rising temperatures, elevated humidity, and shifting wind directions—point to a heightened potential for thunderstorm development, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.
