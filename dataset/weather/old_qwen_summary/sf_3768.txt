Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly during midday, which suggests the influence of fog or low cloud cover. A distinct pressure spike occurred around dawn, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a notable lull, but increased in the afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to a more northerly flow, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns point to the arrival of a coastal influence, with potential for fog dissipation and clearer skies later in the day.
