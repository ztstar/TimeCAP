Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition toward warmer conditions, likely influenced by increasing solar heating and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation earlier in the day and remaining near or at 100%, which suggests a saturated atmosphere conducive to fog or the potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions—though the prior high humidity may delay clearing. Wind speed remained light to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to northeast in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a possible change in circulation patterns that could influence cloud movement or storm development. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of persistent overcast skies and a heightened risk of thunderstorms, especially if additional moisture or instability is introduced.
