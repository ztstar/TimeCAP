Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with San Francisco’s maritime climate. Air pressure gradually increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds decreased during the night and early morning, then picked up again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southwest to southeast, reflecting a change in local airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, likely clearing any overnight fog and improving visibility in the coming hours.
