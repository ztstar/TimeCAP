Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping slightly in the late afternoon before rising again in the evening, indicating a shift in moisture content. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system, followed by a return to more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the mid-morning and early evening, particularly from the west and southwest, which may have contributed to the dispersal of fog and the mixing of air layers. The prevailing wind direction shifted toward the southwest and west, consistent with marine influence, reinforcing the presence of coastal fog and the moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean on the region’s climate.
