Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady overnight cooling trend followed by a pronounced daytime warming, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing typical of a humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to west-southwesterly in the afternoon, which may reflect changing synoptic-scale flow. The combination of rising afternoon temperatures and decreasing humidity could increase the risk of heat stress and contribute to the development of convective activity later in the day.
