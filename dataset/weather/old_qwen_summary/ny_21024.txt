Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought increased cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels rose substantially during this period, particularly as the pressure fell, contributing to a damp and chilly feel. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and eventually to a more northerly direction, with sustained moderate-to-strong winds, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal boundary. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and dynamic wind shifts points to a transition toward unsettled weather, possibly including precipitation later in the day.
