Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more intense daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel and likely facilitated the formation of fog or low clouds. A significant drop in air pressure during the late night and early morning, followed by a rapid rebound, suggests the passage of a weather front, possibly accompanied by localized thunderstorms or showers. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to a more southeasterly direction, with increasing speeds in the afternoon—indicating stronger atmospheric instability and potential storm development. The combination of rising temperatures, sustained high humidity, and fluctuating pressure signals a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day, posing risks of brief heavy rainfall and localized flooding.
