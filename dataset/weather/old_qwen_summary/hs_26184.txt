Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, spiking to near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and a damp, muggy feel. A sharp rise in air pressure in the early morning was followed by a sustained decline, suggesting the passage of a front, possibly associated with a storm system that brought brief precipitation and shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, implying the influence of a developing low-pressure system or outflow boundary. These combined factors point to a dynamic and potentially unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorm development later in the day.
