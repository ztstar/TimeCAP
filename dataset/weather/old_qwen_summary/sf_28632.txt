Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, peaking during the early morning hours and remaining high through mid-morning, suggesting possible fog formation or maritime influence. Air pressure showed a pattern of instability, with a sharp rise followed by a sustained drop, indicating the passage of a weather front or shifting air mass. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow in the early hours and a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions later, likely driven by local topography and pressure gradients. These conditions together suggest an active marine layer influence, with potential for fog and cool, damp mornings, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
