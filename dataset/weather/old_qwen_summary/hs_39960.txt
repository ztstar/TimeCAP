Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A steady decline in atmospheric pressure, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during most of the night but increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air mass, possibly from the south or southeast. These combined factors suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms or showery conditions in the near term as the system progresses through the region.
