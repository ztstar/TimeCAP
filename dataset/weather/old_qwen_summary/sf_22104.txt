Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, but a slight increase in pressure may have coincided with the clearing of foggy conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from the west-southwest to the west-southwest and eventually to the west, consistent with coastal breeze patterns. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and wind shifts suggests a typical marine layer development and dissipation cycle, which is common in the Bay Area and likely led to foggy mornings and clearer conditions later in the day.
