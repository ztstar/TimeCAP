Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, with temperatures rising steadily through the morning and peaking in the late afternoon before easing slightly. Air pressure increased significantly during the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished notably after midday, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. Humidity levels showed a moderate decline during the afternoon, consistent with the warming trend and descending air associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined indicators point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, likely resulting in improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the coming hours.
