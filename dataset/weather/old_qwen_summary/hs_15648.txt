Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a muggy feel and increased potential for localized convection. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the midday, suggesting fair weather conditions, though a minor drop later in the evening may hint at approaching atmospheric changes. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from multiple directions, including a notable shift toward southerly and westerly flows, potentially signaling the influence of a developing weather system. Combined, these trends suggest a transition phase in Houston’s weather, with high moisture content and increasing wind activity raising the possibility of isolated thunderstorms later in the night.
