Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, which likely contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with sustained breezes from the southeast and south, potentially enhancing wind chill and contributing to more dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward potentially stormy or rainy weather, especially if the low-pressure system intensifies and moves over the region.
