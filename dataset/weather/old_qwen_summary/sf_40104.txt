Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, reflecting the presence of marine layer conditions, before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and the influence of offshore winds. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the night and early morning, peaking at the core of the marine layer, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a weakening weather system or a shift in airflow. Wind patterns were variable, with sustained offshore flow in the afternoon and evening, contributing to the clearing of fog and bringing drier air inland, while earlier winds were more onshore and turbulent. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy coastal environment to a warmer, clearer afternoon, typical of San Francisco's microclimate during certain seasons.
