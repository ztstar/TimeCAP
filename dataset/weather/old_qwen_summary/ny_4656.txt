Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period into a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, then dropped sharply during the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and the influence of drier air masses. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were initially moderate and diminished significantly during midday, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. Overall, the data suggests that New York City is experiencing a transition toward drier, more stable, and gradually warmer conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and comfortable daytime temperatures.
