Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from nocturnal radiative cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover during those hours. A significant rise in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, coinciding with a drop in humidity and wind speed, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system bringing drier, more stable air. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to easterly and northerly during the afternoon, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable conditions, though residual moisture and variable winds may still support isolated showers or a lingering risk of thunderstorms.
