Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels reached near saturation during the early hours, remaining consistently high throughout the night and into the early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, suggesting a stable atmospheric regime with no significant frontal systems passing through. Wind speeds were moderate and generally consistent, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south and then southeast, indicating a possible influence from a coastal breeze pattern. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer event, likely resulting in foggy and cool conditions, especially in low-lying and coastal areas, which can impact visibility and outdoor activities.
