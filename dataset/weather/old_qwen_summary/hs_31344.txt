Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in multiple periods, indicating high moisture content and the potential for fog or drizzle during the coolest hours. Air pressure fluctuated but showed a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that may stabilize conditions later. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around dawn, with a sudden surge in speed and a change in direction, likely signaling the passage of a front or a shift in local circulation. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a potentially drier and more variable regime, with implications for comfort levels and the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
