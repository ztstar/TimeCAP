Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a shift from a cool, stable period to a more moderate phase. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that have since dissipated. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, likely due to a high-pressure system influencing the region, which contributed to stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a brief but strong gust in the late evening, coinciding with a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly, hinting at a possible shift in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition from a coastal fog event to clearer, milder conditions, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
