Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely contributed to changing weather conditions. Temperature trends showed a cooling pattern overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained relatively stable during the night and early morning but decreased significantly during midday, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, implying a change in prevailing air flow. The combination of falling pressure, high humidity, and shifting winds points to an increased likelihood of thunderstorms or showery conditions in the near term.
