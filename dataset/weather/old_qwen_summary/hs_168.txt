Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from nighttime lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours and remained elevated through midday before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or potential moisture release. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the early and mid-day hours, peaking in the afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds declined notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly and finally to calm conditions, pointing to the weakening of any prevailing flow. Collectively, these trends suggest a stable high-pressure regime moving in, likely bringing clearer skies and drier conditions in the near term.
