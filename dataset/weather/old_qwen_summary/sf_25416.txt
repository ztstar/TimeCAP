Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, with very low values in the mid-range hours, suggesting dry air intrusion, which later increased significantly, especially in the late evening, indicating potential moisture influx. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a rebound, which may signal the passage of a weather front or system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but surged significantly in the late evening, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with offshore flow or a developing wind event. The shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more variable and occasionally easterly patterns suggests complex local dynamics, possibly influenced by topography and pressure gradients, which could impact fog formation and temperature stratification.
