Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained high values during early morning and overnight periods, suggesting moist air accumulation, likely contributing to fog or mist formation. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a low point, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the early hours followed by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. Collectively, these trends point to a developing low-pressure system bringing moist, unstable air into the region, increasing the likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
