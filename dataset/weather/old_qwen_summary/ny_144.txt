Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning hours, dropping sharply in the midday and then rising again in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass with possible moisture influx. Air pressure showed a sustained increase throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, which typically signals improving weather and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a notable reduction in the afternoon and a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from cooler, stable conditions toward potentially more variable weather, with increased humidity and shifting winds hinting at the approach of a new weather system.
