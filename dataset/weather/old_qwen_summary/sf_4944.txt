Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to fog formation or marine layer development. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, signaling a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions to the region. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of regional pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and residual high humidity implies a transition toward clearer skies and potentially stronger coastal winds in the coming hours.
