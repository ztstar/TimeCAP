Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early hours, dropping sharply in the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure increased notably during the early morning, peaking before a sudden drop in the late evening, which may indicate the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, potentially signaling the arrival of marine layer influence. These patterns collectively suggest a dynamic transition in the local weather, with lingering coastal fog and cooler conditions likely persisting into the coming hours.
