Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖, indicating a cold front passage and subsequent warming trend. Humidity levels experienced a dramatic spike in the late night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or light precipitation during that period. Air pressure steadily dropped throughout the day, reflecting the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, likely responsible for the changing weather conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from light, easterly winds to stronger, more variable flows, including a notable shift to southerly and then westerly directions, consistent with storm development. These combined trends point to an active weather system moving through the region, likely bringing unsettled conditions and possibly precipitation in the near term.
