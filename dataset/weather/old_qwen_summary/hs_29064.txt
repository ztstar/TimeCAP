Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating the presence of moist air that likely contributed to fog or low visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midnight, with wind speeds increasing substantially and changing direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting the influence of a passing weather front. Air pressure showed a pronounced rise in the late evening and early morning, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. These combined factors suggest that Houston has transitioned from a humid, potentially stormy period to a drier, more stable phase, with the potential for clearing skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
