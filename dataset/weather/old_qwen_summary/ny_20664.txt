Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City experienced a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of cold air advection. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting saturated conditions conducive to fog or mist, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased, reaching a peak midday before slightly declining, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a shift toward a more northerly wind direction, likely contributing to the cooling trend. Overall, these patterns point to a transition from a cold, damp nocturnal period to a gradually warming, clearer daytime, with potential for improving conditions later in the day.
