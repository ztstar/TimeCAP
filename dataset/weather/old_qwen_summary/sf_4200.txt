Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, particularly in the early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a persistent high-pressure influence that has suppressed storm development. Wind activity intensified in the late evening and early morning, with gusts from the west and northwest, suggesting a shift in local circulation possibly linked to coastal upwelling or sea breeze dynamics. The combination of cooling temperatures, high moisture content, and shifting wind patterns points to a strong marine influence, consistent with San Francisco’s typical foggy mornings and stable coastal climate.
