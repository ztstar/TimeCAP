Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery during the afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high, peaking at saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a notable intensification in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at a change in air mass. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a humid, stable environment to one that may become drier and more settled as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
