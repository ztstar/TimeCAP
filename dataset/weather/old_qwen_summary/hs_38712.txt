Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, more active daytime air. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and calmer conditions by late evening. Wind speeds remained moderate overnight but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast and east, hinting at the influence of a developing sea breeze or approaching weather front. These combined trends suggest a transition from stable, dry nighttime conditions to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled atmosphere later in the day.
