Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising in the afternoon. A notable increase in humidity occurred during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a marked rise in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the early morning but intensified in the midday, with gusts from the northwest and west, suggesting a shift in airflow possibly linked to regional wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds points to a transition toward clearer and more settled weather in the coming hours.
