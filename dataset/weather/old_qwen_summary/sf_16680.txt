Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a slight increase through the night, followed by a gradual decline toward the end of the period, indicating a possible weakening of high-pressure control. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with only minor fluctuations, and wind direction consistently from the west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and stable winds suggests persistent fog and cool conditions, which are characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly during the overnight transition.
