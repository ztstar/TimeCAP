Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight before dropping significantly during the midday, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increased wind suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward brighter, more comfortable afternoon and evening hours.
