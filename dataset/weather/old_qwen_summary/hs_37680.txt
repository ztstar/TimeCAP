Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night before beginning a gradual rise in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, indicating saturated air conditions, particularly during the early morning hours when dew point was near saturation. Air pressure showed a significant decline, especially in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unstable weather. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southwest to more variable directions, with increased speeds and stronger gusts in the afternoon, potentially signaling storm development. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, especially given the persistent moisture and weakening pressure system.
