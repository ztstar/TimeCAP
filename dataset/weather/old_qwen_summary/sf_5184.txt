Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the pre-dawn hours, aligning with increased wind speeds and a change in wind direction from the southwest to the west and north, suggesting the arrival of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified significantly overnight, with strong gusts recorded in the early morning and again in the late evening, potentially contributing to localized fog and cooler conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and dynamic wind patterns suggests a transitional weather period, likely associated with the passage of a frontal system, which could lead to overcast skies and possible light precipitation later today.
