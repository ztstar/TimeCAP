Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and overcast conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought brief instability. Wind speeds increased substantially in the final hours, particularly from the northwest, indicating a shift in wind patterns that could signal the arrival of more dynamic weather. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and changing wind direction points to a transitional weather phase, potentially leading to overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term.
