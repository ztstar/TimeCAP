Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog or mist and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. A significant increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable air. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and persisted throughout the evening, with a shift in direction indicating a change in airflow patterns, possibly driven by the high-pressure influence. These combined conditions suggest a transition toward clearer skies and more settled weather, though residual moisture may still pose a risk for isolated showers later in the day.
