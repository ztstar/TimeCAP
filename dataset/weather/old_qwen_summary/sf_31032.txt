Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed a significant decline in the late night and early morning, reaching very low values, which suggests the dissipation of fog and the clearing of the marine layer. A persistent high-pressure system is evident from sustained elevated air pressure readings, contributing to stable conditions and dry air, particularly during the early hours. Wind patterns displayed a shift from variable to more consistent southerly and eastward flow during the day, with increased speeds in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the onset of onshore breezes and the transport of warmer air. These combined trends point to a day transitioning from cool, dry conditions with fog clearance to a warmer, stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s coastal microclimate.
