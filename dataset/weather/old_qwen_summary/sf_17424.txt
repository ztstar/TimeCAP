Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before gradually warming toward midday. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or low-level cloud formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the onset of more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, signaling changing airflow patterns possibly linked to local topography or synoptic influences. These conditions collectively point to a cool, damp, and fog-prone environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly during transitional periods between night and day.
