Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, then declined as temperatures rose, suggesting dew point conditions were approaching saturation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, fair weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the early and mid-day hours, with a notable lull in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a resurgence in the late night, accompanied by shifting wind directions consistent with a transition in air mass. Overall, the data indicates a cooling night followed by a warming day under a stabilizing high-pressure regime, likely leading to clear skies and mild conditions in the coming hours.
