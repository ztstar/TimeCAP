Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early morning, reaching a peak midday before declining slightly in the late evening, suggesting a passing weather system. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with stronger gusts in the late night and early morning, primarily from the west-southwest, shifting to variable directions later in the day. These patterns point to the influence of a coastal low-pressure system moving offshore, bringing cool, moist air overnight and clearing skies during the afternoon, likely resulting in a partly cloudy to clear evening.
