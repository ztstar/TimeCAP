Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained persistently high during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air likely associated with a low-pressure system or nocturnal boundary layer stabilization. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a passing high-pressure system that brought drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift toward a more southerly to southeasterly direction, suggesting the onset of a warm, moist onshore flow. The combination of rising temperatures, increasing wind speeds, and a shift in wind direction points to the potential for developing convection later in the evening, possibly leading to thunderstorms.
