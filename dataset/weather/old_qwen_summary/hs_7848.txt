Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nighttime cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar radiation. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting increased moisture availability likely due to nocturnal condensation or air mass changes. Air pressure showed a notable spike during the early morning, followed by a gradual decline, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system or a developing low-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly to easterly and then to a more variable direction in the afternoon, with a brief increase in speed, possibly signaling a change in atmospheric stability. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover or localized precipitation later in the day.
