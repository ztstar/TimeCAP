Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable shift in wind patterns, with strong southerly and easterly winds occurring in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during early morning and late night hours, suggesting periodic moisture influx, likely tied to marine layer development. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early hours of the day was followed by a sustained rise, signaling the passage of a weather system that may have brought transient instability. Temperature trends displayed a moderate diurnal cycle, with cooler conditions in the early morning and a gradual increase during midday, though the overall range remained relatively stable. These combined factors point to a dynamic but transitional weather phase, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions in the coming hours.
