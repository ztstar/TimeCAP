Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the latter half of the period, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, declining significantly during the afternoon, which may suggest a drying trend associated with changing air masses. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the daytime, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon and remained strong through the evening, with southerly to easterly winds dominating, potentially contributing to the transport of moist air into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, diminishing humidity, and consistent southeasterly winds points to a transition toward drier, more settled weather conditions, although localized cloud development or isolated showers cannot be ruled out.
