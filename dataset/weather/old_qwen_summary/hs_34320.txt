Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition into warmer conditions, likely driven by solar heating and air mass changes. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours before dropping sharply through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass moving in. A notable pressure increase in the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a sharp drop, points to the passage of a weather front, potentially associated with thunderstorm activity. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from prevailing southerly to easterly and northerly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable environment to a more unstable and potentially storm-prone regime, with implications for afternoon thunderstorms and rising discomfort levels.
