Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A sharp drop in air pressure during the early hours signaled the approach of a weather system, which was followed by a steady increase in pressure later in the day, indicating stabilization. Wind patterns shifted from moderate, southerly flows in the night to stronger, more variable winds in the afternoon, with gusts reaching notable speeds, suggesting active atmospheric dynamics. Combined with the temperature rise and declining humidity, these changes point to the passage of a front, likely bringing clearer skies and a transition to more stable, cooler conditions by the next day.
