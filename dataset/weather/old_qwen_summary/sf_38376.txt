Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, approaching saturation for much of the period, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or drizzle, typical of the region’s microclimate. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling, particularly in the early hours, followed by a slight rebound in the late afternoon, likely due to changes in wind patterns and solar exposure. Wind speed increased significantly in the afternoon, with strong southerly to easterly flow developing, potentially bringing in maritime air and enhancing coastal fog formation. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more easterly and then southeasterly suggests evolving synoptic conditions, possibly linked to a cold front or atmospheric instability, which may lead to continued overcast skies and light precipitation.
