Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation during those hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight upward trend in the afternoon may signal improving weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and persisted at moderate to strong levels through the day, with winds shifting from the northwest to the northeast, potentially indicating a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and consistent wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
