Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which is typical of fog formation due to condensation near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decline in the mid-morning, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system that may have allowed for increased moisture influx. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly and eventually westerly, indicating changing airflow patterns likely tied to local topography and sea-breeze effects. These conditions suggest an active marine layer with potential for fog or low clouds persisting into the morning hours, impacting visibility and creating a cool, damp environment typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
