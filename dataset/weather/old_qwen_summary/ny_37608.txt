Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, followed by a sharp drop as the day warmed. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, fair weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and later to a more westerly flow, potentially signaling a change in air mass. This combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and a transition in wind direction points to a shift toward drier, more stable conditions, with improving visibility and reduced chance of precipitation.
