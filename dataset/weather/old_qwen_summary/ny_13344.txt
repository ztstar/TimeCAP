Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were notably low during the overnight and morning hours, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a shift toward more moist air, possibly due to a change in circulation patterns. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum around midday before stabilizing, which often precedes or accompanies the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow that shifted toward the northwest in the evening, indicating changing wind patterns likely tied to a developing or passing frontal system. Combined, these trends suggest a transition in weather conditions, potentially bringing cloudier skies and a higher chance of precipitation later in the day.
