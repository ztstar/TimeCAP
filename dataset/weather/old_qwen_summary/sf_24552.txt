Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, with a sharp drop during midday, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture content. Air pressure showed a brief but notable dip in the late afternoon, followed by a return to higher values, which may signal the passage of a weak weather front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal wind patterns and potential for fog development. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the final hours, coupled with decreasing humidity, implies a possible change in air mass, potentially bringing drier and more stable conditions.
