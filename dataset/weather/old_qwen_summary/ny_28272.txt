Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady upward trend, indicating a warming pattern, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels began high in the early morning, gradually decreased through the midday, and then rose again toward the end of the period, suggesting possible moisture accumulation. Air pressure declined initially, reached a low point in the early hours, and then steadily increased, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, peaking in the early evening before subsiding, with wind direction shifting from easterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cooler, moist, and unstable air mass to a warmer and drier one, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies in the near term.
