Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, suggesting potential moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a gradual decline during the night, followed by a slight recovery in the morning, which may indicate the approach of a weak low-pressure system or atmospheric instability. Wind speed remained consistently low and unchanging, indicating calm conditions with minimal air movement, which can contribute to the retention of heat and moisture near the surface. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and stable wind patterns suggests a growing potential for discomfort and could signal the development of afternoon thunderstorms if additional lift is introduced.
