Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming toward the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that diminished as temperatures rose. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the final hours, indicating the possible approach of a weather system, potentially bringing change in conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with a calm period from late night through early morning, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, particularly from the northeast sector. These combined factors suggest a transition period, with lingering marine influence and the potential for shifting weather patterns, including possible precipitation or fog return in the coming hours.
