Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early and late periods, suggesting saturated air conditions conducive to fog or mist formation, particularly in the early morning. A notable pressure spike in the late evening was accompanied by a sharp rise in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, signaling the arrival of a frontal system or storm passage. The sustained high wind speeds and abrupt change in wind direction point to dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially bringing unstable weather conditions. These combined factors suggest that New York City experienced a transition from stable, cool, and humid conditions to a more turbulent environment, increasing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
