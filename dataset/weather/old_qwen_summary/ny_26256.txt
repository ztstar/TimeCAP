Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike in the early morning hours, suggesting possible dew formation or fog development. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the afternoon, culminating in a sharp rise just before midnight, which is typically associated with improving weather and the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds exhibited intermittent bursts, particularly in the late evening and early morning, with a consistent shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, hinting at changing airflow patterns. These indicators collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely bringing clearer skies and milder temperatures in the near term.
