Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked variability, peaking during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with a notable rise during the early night followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, indicating a possible frontal passage or shifting weather systems. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, which may signal a change in atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest that San Francisco is transitioning through a period of dynamic weather, potentially involving the onset of coastal fog and a shift toward more variable conditions.
