Over the past 24 hours, a sustained drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicates the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions to New York City. Temperatures remained consistently low throughout the night and into the early morning, gradually rising during the afternoon, suggesting a slow warming trend following the influence of the frontal system. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, remaining near saturation, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, with strong southerly and easterly winds preceding the low-pressure trough, followed by a sharp decline in wind activity in the late afternoon. The shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly and then to more northerly sectors signals the passage of a cold front, which likely brought the recent precipitation and cleared skies, leaving behind cooler, drier conditions as the system moved eastward.
