Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and remaining low into the early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to marine influence and fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent increase from the early morning hours onward, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies later. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a steady southerly to southwesterly flow that likely contributed to the transport of moist maritime air inland. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and stable pressure implies a high likelihood of persistent fog or low stratus clouds, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which could affect visibility and comfort.
