Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the influence of a cold front passing through. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night, coinciding with a significant increase in air pressure, suggesting the arrival of a stable, high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong gusts from the northwest to west-southwest sectors, contributing to a chilling wind chill effect. The consistent rise in pressure and shift toward drier conditions in the latter half of the period point toward clearing skies and improving weather. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a damp, windy, and cold night to a progressively drier and more stable environment, likely leading to a clearer, cooler day ahead.
