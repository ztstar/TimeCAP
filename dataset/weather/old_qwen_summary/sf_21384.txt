Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of cool temperatures, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking and maintaining near saturation, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed a steady rise during the night and early morning, stabilizing at a relatively high level, suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system that contributed to stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained light for most of the period, with only minor fluctuations, though the direction shifted significantly during the day, suggesting changing local wind patterns driven by coastal dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a classic marine layer pattern, with fog and low clouds likely present overnight, followed by a gradual clearing and warming trend as the day progressed.
