Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by cloud cover and humidity. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, remaining elevated into the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating the passage of a moist air mass and potential for precipitation earlier in the cycle. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations with a slight rise during the day, suggesting the influence of a weak high-pressure system, though no strong pressure gradient was evident. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and southeast, potentially signaling the onset of convective activity or a shifting wind pattern associated with a developing weather system. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and variable wind patterns raises the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
