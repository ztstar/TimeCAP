Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that has since begun to dissipate. Air pressure increased consistently, particularly during the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a strong high-pressure system that has brought stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds weakened significantly in the final hours, especially during the late night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from a southerly to a northeasterly flow, consistent with the influence of the high-pressure ridge. These combined trends point to a transition toward drier, calmer, and more settled weather, with reduced chances of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
