Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升 during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before moderating, indicating increasing moisture in the lower atmosphere, which may suggest the approach of a weather front. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly during the night and early morning, followed by a slight rebound, reflecting the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the observed changes in temperature and humidity. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening and overnight, with strong southerly and easterly flows developing, consistent with the dynamics of a developing storm system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly sectors, combined with the atmospheric changes, suggests an active weather pattern that could lead to precipitation or changing conditions in the coming hours.
