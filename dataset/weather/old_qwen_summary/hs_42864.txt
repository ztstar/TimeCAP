Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking and remaining high through the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and into the early morning, then stabilized, reflecting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought increased cloud cover and the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased noticeably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing wind patterns possibly associated with a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and instability increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
