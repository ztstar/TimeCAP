Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the potential for fog or mist formation during the early hours. A consistent increase in atmospheric pressure suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the northeast, hinting at a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds points to improving weather conditions with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air by the next day.
