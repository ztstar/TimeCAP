Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. A sharp rise in humidity to near saturation levels during the early hours, coupled with a sudden drop in air pressure, suggests the passage of a weather front, likely bringing coastal fog and overcast conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, with a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow that may enhance fog formation. The abrupt spike in pressure during the midday hours, followed by a decline, points to a complex interaction between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure disturbance, potentially influencing storm development. Overall, the data reflect a dynamic coastal atmosphere marked by cooling, fog-prone conditions, and changing wind patterns typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
