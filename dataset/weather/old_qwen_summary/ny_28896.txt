Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking in the late night and early morning before sharply dropping, suggesting the influence of dry air following frontal passage. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, reaching a high before stabilizing, which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from west to northwest to more northerly, indicating a change in upper-level flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition to drier, cooler, and more stable conditions, likely resulting in improved visibility and a decrease in precipitation risk in the coming hours.
