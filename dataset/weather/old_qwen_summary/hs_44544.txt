Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during that period. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind patterns shifted significantly, transitioning from southerly to southerly and easterly directions, with increasing speeds later in the day, potentially indicating the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined conditions suggest a heightened risk of thunderstorms, especially in the evening and overnight hours, due to the convergence of warm, moist air and dynamic wind shifts.
