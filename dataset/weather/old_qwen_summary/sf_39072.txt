Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels showed high variability, with a sharp spike during the late night and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a brief period of stronger gusts in the early morning, followed by a significant drop during mid-morning and an increase again in the evening, particularly from the south and southeast. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests changing airflow patterns, possibly influenced by coastal dynamics, which may contribute to the observed temperature and humidity fluctuations.
