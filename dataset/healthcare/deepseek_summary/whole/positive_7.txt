Influenza activity has shown a sustained and significant upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both the absolute number of positive specimens and their proportion among tested samples increasing sharply. The dominance of Influenza A is evident, contributing the majority of positive cases, particularly during the recent peak period, while Influenza B has maintained a steady but lower level of circulation. A notable inflection point occurred in the last 5 weeks, marked by a sharp decline in positivity rates following a peak, suggesting the potential onset of a post-epidemic decline. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B has stabilized at a relatively high level compared to historical patterns, indicating sustained transmission that may influence vaccine effectiveness and public health response. These trends imply a mature epidemic phase with increasing burden on healthcare systems and urgent need for targeted interventions, including vaccination campaigns and surveillance adjustments.
