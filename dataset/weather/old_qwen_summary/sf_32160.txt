Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early hours, peaking overnight before dropping significantly during the morning, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog or low clouds. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, then stabilized, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified overnight, especially from the southeast, before calming substantially in the morning, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly and finally to easterly, signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a marine-influenced, foggy night to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming day—consistent with a typical San Francisco weather pattern driven by coastal dynamics and pressure changes.
