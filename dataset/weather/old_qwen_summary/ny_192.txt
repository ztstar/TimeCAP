Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the onset of a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar insolation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours of the morning and again in the evening, with sustained high values suggesting moisture accumulation, possibly linked to a low-pressure system or maritime influence. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a minimum around midnight, which is indicative of an approaching weather front or storm system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southeast and later from the southwest, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions and potential for precipitation. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and fluctuating wind patterns points to a developing storm system that could bring rain or thunderstorms to New York City in the near term.
