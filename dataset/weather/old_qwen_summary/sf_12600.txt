Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to the cooler perceived temperatures. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring further unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the day, with a notable reduction in the late evening and early morning, followed by a return of stronger winds from the northwest and north sectors. The shift in wind direction from west to north and then to the east suggests a change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns that could lead to more variable conditions in the coming hours.
