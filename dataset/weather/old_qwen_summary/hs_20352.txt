Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining steadily through the day, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased slightly during the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low and consistent until mid-afternoon, when they began to increase, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest toward the southeast, hinting at a change in airflow patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from a cool, humid night to a warmer, drier afternoon, with the potential for improved conditions later in the day as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
