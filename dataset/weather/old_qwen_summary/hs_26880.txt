Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase through the afternoon and into the evening, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of stable, moist air and potential for fog or drizzle in the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a brief increase during the late afternoon, likely associated with the development of convective activity. The combination of high moisture, weakening pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates a heightened likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
