Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent downward trend, indicating a cooling atmosphere, likely due to the arrival of a cold front. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp spike during the early morning hours followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass that has since dissipated. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the middle of the period, followed by a strong rebound, signaling the influence of a low-pressure system moving through, which may have brought precipitation earlier in the day. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with a significant gust observed in the early hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, indicating a change in airflow associated with the storm system. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, likely resulting in unsettled conditions with potential for cooler, breezier, and possibly rainy weather in the immediate hours ahead.
