Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, before declining sharply as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west and northwest, likely associated with a boundary interaction or outflow from developing convection. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing drier and cooler air, which may suppress further storm development despite earlier high moisture levels.
