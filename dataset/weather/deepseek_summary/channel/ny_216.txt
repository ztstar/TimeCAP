- Humidity (%): Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the early and mid-period, indicating saturated atmospheric conditions that may suggest ongoing moisture accumulation or precipitation. A sharp decline occurred toward the latter half, with a significant drop followed by a partial recovery, reflecting potential clearing skies or the influence of a changing air mass. This pattern implies a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, potentially more stable air, which could signal the end of a period of cloudiness or rainfall.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure remained stable at a baseline level for the first 14 hours before showing a gradual decline, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions. A notable drop occurred in the latter half of the period, followed by a brief recovery, suggesting the influence of an approaching weather system. The sustained low readings toward the end imply potential for deteriorating weather, such as increased cloud cover or precipitation.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a consistent decline during the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing through the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by a warming phase. A notable dip in the middle of the series suggests a brief period of intensified cooling, potentially linked to nighttime radiative loss or atmospheric changes. The subsequent recovery and stabilization toward the end of the period point to a return to equilibrium, likely reflecting the onset of morning daylight and rising ambient heat.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a stable baseline with minor fluctuations for the first 12 hours, followed by a gradual increase toward midday, peaking in the late afternoon before a sharp decline. A notable anomaly occurred with a complete lull in wind activity, suggesting a temporary atmospheric stillness that may indicate the passage of a weak pressure system or localized calm conditions. The subsequent resurgence in wind activity toward the end of the period points to re-established airflow, possibly due to changing pressure gradients or boundary layer dynamics.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a consistent shift from northerly to easterly and then southerly sectors over the initial 12 hours, suggesting a gradual change in atmospheric flow. A notable pivot occurred mid-period, transitioning through westerly and southwesterly directions, culminating in a marked reversal toward northerly flow by the final hours. This dynamic shift indicates evolving pressure gradients, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front, with implications for changing wind patterns and possible impacts on local weather conditions.
