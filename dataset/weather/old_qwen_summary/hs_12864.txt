Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable warming trend, with temperatures steadily rising through the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight, peaking in the hours just before dawn, before declining sharply during midday, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, with calm conditions prevailing around midnight, but increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively indicate a developing high-pressure ridge bringing warmer, drier air into the region, likely suppressing precipitation and contributing to a comfortable, stable atmospheric environment.
