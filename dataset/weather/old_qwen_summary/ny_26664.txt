Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. A sharp rise in humidity during the early hours, peaking at saturation, coincided with a period of calm winds and stable pressure, indicating the presence of a low-level moisture layer and potential for fog or light precipitation. The pressure remained relatively stable until the late morning, when it began to rise steadily, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from a northerly direction, likely driven by the developing pressure gradient, which may contribute to a noticeable cooling effect and improved air circulation. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast in the evening, combined with rising pressure and decreasing humidity, points to a transition toward more stable and pleasant weather conditions.
