Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal pattern typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels declined sharply after midnight, dropping from near saturation to considerably drier conditions by midday, suggesting the dissipation of a nocturnal boundary layer and possible clearing of low-level cloud cover. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of the influence of a high-pressure system enhancing atmospheric stability and suppressing convective activity. Wind speeds increased during the overnight and early morning hours, with gusts from the northwest and west, before tapering off in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to the weakening of synoptic forcing. The shift in wind direction from west to east in the early morning hours may reflect the onset of a sea breeze, a common feature in Houston during warm periods, potentially signaling a transition toward more stable daytime conditions.
