Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed. A sharp drop in air pressure in the early hours coincided with rising humidity and a shift in wind patterns, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. The highest humidity levels, reaching saturation, were accompanied by calm to light winds, suggesting the potential for fog or drizzle during the night. Later in the day, wind speeds increased substantially, particularly from the southwest, likely associated with the system's reorganization and the return of warmer, drier air. The combined pattern of pressure recovery, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds points to improving conditions and a likely transition to clearer skies by the next day.
