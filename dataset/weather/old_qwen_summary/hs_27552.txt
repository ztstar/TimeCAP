Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before gradually declining, indicating the influence of nocturnal condensation and possible moisture influx. Air pressure showed a pronounced increase in the early morning, followed by a gradual decline through midday and a rebound in the late evening, suggesting the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified notably in the latter half of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with changing airflow patterns. These combined dynamics point to an evolving atmospheric setup, potentially signaling the approach or passage of a frontal boundary, which could lead to unstable conditions and precipitation later in the day.
