Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and reduced cloud cover. Humidity remained near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, but declined significantly in the afternoon as air warmed and moisture content decreased. A consistent drop in atmospheric pressure throughout the day, especially in the late afternoon, signals the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, shifting from variable directions to a more sustained southerly to southeasterly flow, which could facilitate the transport of moist air and potential storm development. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward a potentially unstable and storm-prone environment in the coming hours.
