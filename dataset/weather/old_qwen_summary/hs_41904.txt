Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by changing solar exposure. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during early morning hours. A significant shift in wind direction occurred around dawn, with winds transitioning from southerly to northeasterly, coinciding with a rise in air pressure that suggests the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late morning and afternoon, which may have aided in dispersing moisture and improving air quality. The overall pattern points to a stable, humid atmosphere with a transition from a moist, calm nocturnal condition to a drier, more ventilated daytime regime.
