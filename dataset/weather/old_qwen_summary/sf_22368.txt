Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early hours before steadily decreasing, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained largely stable with a slight increase in the afternoon, signaling a potential shift toward more settled weather. Wind speeds diminished overnight, reaching a minimum around dawn, then gradually increased again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a notable change in wind direction from southwest to northwest, potentially indicating a shift in regional airflow. These trends collectively point to a transition from a foggy, damp overnight period to clearer, drier conditions in the late afternoon, which may enhance visibility and improve overall comfort levels as the day ends.
