Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the late morning and remaining consistently high, suggesting the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, particularly during the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable reduction in wind activity during mid-morning, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more northeasterly, consistent with a change in air mass flow. The combination of rising humidity, increasing pressure, and weakening winds points to a transition toward clearer skies and stable weather, with minimal precipitation expected in the near term.
