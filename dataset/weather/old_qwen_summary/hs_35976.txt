Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking at near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and increased moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a generally stable pattern with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may be bringing drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening and overnight, with gusts reaching higher levels and wind direction shifting toward the northeast, possibly indicating the approach of a frontal boundary. Combined, these trends suggest a transition period with potential for changing weather, including the possibility of scattered thunderstorms later in the day as moisture and instability build.
