Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained high through the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the approach of a weather system. The increasing wind speeds and changing wind directions later in the day, especially from the south and southeast, point to the influence of a developing low-pressure system or frontal passage. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with elevated risks of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the near term.
