Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels showed a significant increase late at night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that dissipated as temperatures rose. A notable wind surge occurred in the early morning, coinciding with a sharp rise in humidity and a drop in air pressure, which may have contributed to the formation of fog or low stratus clouds. The wind direction shifted dramatically during this period, transitioning from offshore to onshore flows, potentially bringing marine air into the region and influencing local temperature and moisture patterns. Overall, the data indicates a typical coastal weather pattern with nocturnal cooling, fog formation, and diurnal wind cycles driven by the temperature contrast between land and sea.
