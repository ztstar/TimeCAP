Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential development of convective activity. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early and late hours, peaking toward the end of the period, which enhances the potential for thunderstorm formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline, especially in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with stronger gusts and shifting directions, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions and possible storm development. These combined factors point to a heightened risk of thunderstorms, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, with implications for localized heavy rainfall and wind gusts.
