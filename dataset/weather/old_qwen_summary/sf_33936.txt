Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early hours before beginning a gradual回升 in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which contributed to a dense, moist air mass that likely enhanced fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, but a slight dip in the late evening suggested a subtle shift in atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts in the late morning and evening, primarily from the west-southwest and south sectors, suggesting localized sea breeze influences. Overall, the conditions point to a typical coastal pattern—cool, foggy nights followed by gradual warming and clearing, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
