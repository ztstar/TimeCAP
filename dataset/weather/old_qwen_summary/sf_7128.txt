Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping during the day, suggesting the presence of marine fog that likely formed during the cooler nighttime hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, which may signal the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the day, with a slight intensification in the late evening, consistent with typical coastal breezes. These patterns collectively point to a stable, foggy morning followed by clearing skies and mild temperatures, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate influenced by the Pacific Ocean.
