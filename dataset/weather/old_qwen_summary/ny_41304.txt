Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and then declining significantly through the night, indicating a strong nocturnal temperature drop. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early hours, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening, particularly during the final hours, with gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with frontal passage dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition period marked by cooling, rising moisture, and increasing wind, indicating potential for precipitation or storm development in the near term.
