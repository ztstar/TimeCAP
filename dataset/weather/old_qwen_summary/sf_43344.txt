Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine fog that likely dissipated as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of significant frontal systems, though a slight increase during the early morning may hint at a brief high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing local circulation patterns, possibly linked to the sea breeze cycle. These conditions indicate a typical coastal weather pattern with fog formation overnight, clearing during the day, and increasing wind activity in the evening—consistent with San Francisco’s temperate, maritime climate.
