Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal phase into a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting saturated air conditions that contribute to a muggy atmosphere and potential for precipitation. A sharp rise in air pressure occurred midday, peaking and remaining elevated through the evening, signaling the approach and presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, which may have contributed to mixing and dispersion of moisture, while changes in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest indicate shifting air mass dynamics. Combined, these factors suggest a transition from a humid, possibly storm-prone environment to a more stable, drier regime, with implications for reduced rainfall and improved air quality in the near term.
