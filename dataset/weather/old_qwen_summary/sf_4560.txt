Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with high moisture content in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, dropping sharply during midday before rising again in the late evening. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the early morning, with sustained strong winds from the west and northwest, suggesting a developing marine influence. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight rise during the night, indicating the presence of a high-pressure system contributing to stable conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, shifting wind patterns, and fluctuating humidity suggests the arrival of a coastal fog event, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, likely affecting visibility and comfort in the region.
