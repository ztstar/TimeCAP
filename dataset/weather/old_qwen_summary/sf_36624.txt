Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a highly variable pattern, frequently spiking to near saturation during nighttime hours, particularly in the early morning, suggesting fog formation or marine layer activity. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp drop during the early morning hours followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds remained consistently moderate to strong throughout the period, with sustained breezes from the northwest and west sectors, reinforcing coastal cooling and moisture transport. These combined conditions point to the influence of a persistent marine layer, contributing to cool, foggy mornings and unstable atmospheric dynamics that could lead to scattered showers or overcast conditions later in the day.
