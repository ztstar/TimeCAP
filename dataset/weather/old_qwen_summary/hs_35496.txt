Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking near saturation, which suggests increased moisture availability and a higher likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for drier, cooler air infiltration. Collectively, these trends point to a transition toward more stable, drier, and cooler conditions in the coming hours, with reduced chances of precipitation.
