Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity peaked in the early hours and then declined sharply, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained minimal until late evening, when they increased significantly, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns point to the onset of a dynamic weather shift, potentially leading to stormy conditions or precipitation in the near term.
