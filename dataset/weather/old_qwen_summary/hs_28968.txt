Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increasing moisture content in the atmosphere and potential for dew formation or fog. Air pressure showed a notable increase, particularly in the early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout most of the period, with a marked increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more westerly, suggesting a change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition toward drier, more stable air, likely resulting in improving conditions with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
