Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and a drop in wind speed, which likely reflects the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system offshore. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the day, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow during the night and early morning, transitioning to more variable and lighter winds later in the day. These conditions point to a stable marine layer that has begun to break down, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours, especially in coastal areas.
