Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and remaining low through early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early hours, indicating increasing moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and easterly directions, with stronger gusts in the late evening and early morning, likely enhancing coastal upwelling and cooling. These combined factors point to a persistent marine layer and a dynamic coastal atmosphere, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for foggy mornings and cool, breezy conditions through the day.
