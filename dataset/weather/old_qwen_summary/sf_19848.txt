Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of cool temperatures, with a gradual decline through the night followed by a slight warming trend in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours before beginning to decline, indicating prolonged moisture presence near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a minor drop in the late night and early morning, suggesting a possible influence of a weak low-pressure system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning hours, maintaining a moderate to brisk pace before tapering off in the late afternoon, with winds consistently coming from the northeast quadrant. These conditions collectively suggest the presence of a marine layer that has persisted through the night, contributing to cool, damp conditions and potentially leading to fog or low clouds, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate.
