Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking just before dawn, then plummeted dramatically in the late morning, suggesting a significant drying trend likely due to increased wind and solar heating. Air pressure showed a sustained high value through much of the night, followed by a sharp decline in the early morning, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds remained moderate through the night but intensified significantly in the mid-to-late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined indicators point to a transitioning weather regime, potentially increasing the risk of unstable conditions, including isolated thunderstorms, as warm, moist air interacts with the approaching disturbance.
