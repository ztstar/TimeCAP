Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained high values during the night and early morning, suggesting possible fog or mist formation, while a sharp drop in the afternoon pointed to clearing skies and improved air quality. Air pressure declined steadily throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, consistent with the inflow of moist air from the Atlantic. These combined indicators suggest a developing frontal system, potentially leading to precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
