Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-morning hours. A strong pressure rise occurred during the early part of the period, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, contributing to dense fog or low clouds, which persisted until mid-morning when a sharp drop in humidity occurred. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, suggesting a coastal influence and potential for onshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the afternoon, combined with falling pressure, hints at a possible change in weather patterns, possibly signaling the approach of a new air mass or the onset of a coastal breeze cycle.
