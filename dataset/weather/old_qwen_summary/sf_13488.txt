Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable in the first half of the period before increasing significantly in the late night and early morning, indicating a shift toward more moist air. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, peaking midday before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, which may signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds surged dramatically during the early morning, driven by strong westerly winds, then diminished through the day, suggesting the passage of a transient atmospheric disturbance. The shift in wind direction from the west to more southerly and northerly sectors reflects changing air mass dynamics, consistent with the influence of coastal upwelling and synoptic-scale weather patterns.
