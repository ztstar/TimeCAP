Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the early hours. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the afternoon, with wind speeds increasing and direction shifting from southerly to easterly, suggesting the influence of a developing marine layer or onshore flow. Air pressure fluctuated throughout the day, with a marked rise during the afternoon and a subsequent drop in the evening, signaling possible changes in atmospheric stability and potential for shifting weather conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition from a stable, foggy morning to a more variable and potentially windy afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
