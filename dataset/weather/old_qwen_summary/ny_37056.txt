Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing dynamic weather changes. Temperature trends show a cooling period overnight followed by a gradual warming, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which correlates with the formation of fog or drizzle. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined indicators suggest the onset of unsettled weather, with potential for precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
