Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of dew formation and potentially reducing visibility. Air pressure showed a sustained increase, culminating in a stable high-pressure system that may be suppressing convective activity. Wind patterns were variable, with shifts from southerly to westerly directions and occasional gusts, suggesting a dynamic boundary interaction. These conditions point to a transition toward more stable, humid weather with reduced storm potential, though overnight fog remains a possible concern due to elevated moisture and cooling.
