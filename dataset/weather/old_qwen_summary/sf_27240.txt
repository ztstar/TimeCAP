Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the early morning, followed by a drop and then a second rise later in the day, pointing to the passage of two distinct weather systems, possibly a frontal boundary followed by a high-pressure build-up. Wind speeds remained low and variable through the night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, which may signal a change in regional wind patterns driven by pressure gradients. These conditions collectively suggest a dynamic transition period, likely contributing to fog formation overnight and clearing skies by late afternoon, consistent with typical coastal microclimate behavior in San Francisco.
