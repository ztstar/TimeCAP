Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, indicating a shift toward more moist air, which may have contributed to the formation of low-level clouds or fog. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability. Wind patterns shifted from consistent easterly to more variable directions, with a notable change in the late night hours, potentially signaling a change in synoptic-scale flow. These trends collectively suggest increasing potential for convective activity later in the day, especially as temperatures rise and moisture remains elevated.
