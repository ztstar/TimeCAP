Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating increasing heat accumulation. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning, sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds showed variability, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, and a consistent southerly to westerly flow that intensified toward the evening. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and decreasing humidity points to a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
