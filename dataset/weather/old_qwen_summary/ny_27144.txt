Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before gradually rising. Humidity fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early hours before dropping sharply during the mid-morning, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure increased steadily overnight, culminating in a notable rise in the late morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a brief lull during the early hours followed by renewed gusts in the afternoon, driven by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the northwest. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and variable winds points to improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies later in the day.
