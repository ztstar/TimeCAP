Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cold overnight period. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, then sharply decreased during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as daytime heating intensified. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the period, particularly in the late evening and early morning, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, with stronger gusts persisting into the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest the onset of a more unsettled weather pattern, with the potential for developing precipitation or storm activity later in the day.
