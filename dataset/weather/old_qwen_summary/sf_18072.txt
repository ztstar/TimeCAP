Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and then stabilizing at lower levels, indicating a transition toward cooler conditions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which contributed to a persistent foggy and damp atmosphere, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies in the coming hours. Wind speeds increased notably overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before subsiding slightly, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns influenced by coastal dynamics. These combined factors point to a lingering marine layer and the potential for foggy conditions persisting into the next day, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas.
