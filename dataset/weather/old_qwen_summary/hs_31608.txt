Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from variable to more consistent southerly and easterly flows, with increasing speeds in the late afternoon, suggesting potential for convective development as instability builds. The combination of high moisture, increasing temperatures, and stronger winds points to a heightened risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
