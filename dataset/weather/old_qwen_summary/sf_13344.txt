Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a low point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to persistent low-lying fog and reduced visibility. A marked increase in air pressure during the night and early morning suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, promoting stable and clear conditions as the day progressed. Wind speeds intensified in the early hours, accompanied by variable wind directions, indicating dynamic air circulation, possibly linked to coastal breezes or frontal influences. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds points to a strong likelihood of foggy conditions, especially in the early morning, with a gradual clearing trend as the day advanced.
