Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, reaching saturation and contributing to a persistent foggy or misty condition, which likely reduced visibility and increased the perceived coolness. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions. Wind patterns shifted from moderate southerly to easterly and then to a strong southeasterly flow in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation that could precede the approach of a moisture-laden front. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, with the potential for increased cloud cover and scattered showers later in the day as the system evolves.
