Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly during the afternoon before subsiding again, with wind directions shifting from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising humidity, stable high pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward more humid and potentially unsettled conditions later in the day.
