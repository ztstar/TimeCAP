Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning, indicating a cooling trend followed by a modest recovery. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike during the early morning hours, suggesting possible condensation or fog formation. Air pressure rose steadily over the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the afternoon, particularly in the late evening, with stronger gusts originating from varied directions, including a southerly surge that may have brought in moist air. These combined patterns suggest a transition from cooler, damp conditions to a more stable, breezy environment, potentially improving visibility and reducing the chance of precipitation.
