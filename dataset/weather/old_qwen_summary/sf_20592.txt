Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in air pressure, indicating the approach and establishment of a stable high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk. Temperature fluctuations remained relatively modest, with a slight cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a warming phase in the afternoon, consistent with diurnal patterns typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels stayed consistently high throughout the period, suggesting persistent marine influence and the potential for fog formation, especially during the overnight hours. Wind speeds diminished significantly through the night and into the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, reflecting a change in local circulation that may have reduced coastal upwelling. These conditions collectively point to a stable, fog-prone environment with diminishing wind and increasing atmospheric pressure, likely resulting in mild, overcast mornings and clearer afternoon skies.
