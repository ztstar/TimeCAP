Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise overnight, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clear skies and calm conditions in the early hours. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, signaling a possible change in air mass or the approach of a developing weather system. The combination of rising temperatures, increasing wind speeds, and a shift in wind direction may indicate the onset of a transition period, potentially leading to unstable conditions or thunderstorm development later in the day.
