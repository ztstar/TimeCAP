Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating a shift from damp, stable conditions to drier air. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout most of the period, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction toward the southeast, which may signal an approaching low-pressure system or convective activity. These combined trends point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and increasing wind suggesting possible thunderstorms in the near term.
