Temperature trends indicate a significant cooling period during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning hours, suggesting the influence of a cold front that passed through the region. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which is consistent with increased moisture availability following the front’s passage. Air pressure exhibited a marked increase midday, particularly during the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind patterns shifted dramatically from predominantly northwesterly to southeasterly in the afternoon, indicating a change in circulation associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined factors point to a transition from unstable, cooler conditions to clearer skies and calmer weather, likely leading to improved visibility and a more settled forecast for the coming hours.
