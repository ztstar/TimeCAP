Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming, particularly in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then decreased significantly during the day, suggesting drier air as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, typical of a developing frontal passage. These combined trends suggest the potential for changing weather conditions, including possible precipitation and cooler temperatures later in the day.
