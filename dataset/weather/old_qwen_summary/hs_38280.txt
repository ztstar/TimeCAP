Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the night, peaking in the early morning, followed by a decline in the late afternoon, suggesting possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, hinting at a change in airflow patterns. These combined conditions suggest a transition period, potentially setting the stage for increased cloud cover and a higher likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
