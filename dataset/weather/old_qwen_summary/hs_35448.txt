Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that contributed to clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent in the morning, diminished during the night, and increased again in the late afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, hinting at changing air flow patterns. The combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind speeds suggests improving weather conditions, with reduced chances of precipitation and a greater likelihood of clear skies in the near term.
