A significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable period to a warming phase. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass or a shift in air flow. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the mid-morning, reaching a peak before declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, potentially bringing in drier air and contributing to the observed temperature rise. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a developing atmospheric instability, which could lead to afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture becomes available.
