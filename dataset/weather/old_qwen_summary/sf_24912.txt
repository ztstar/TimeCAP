Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-night, suggesting the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly and southerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These changes point to a dynamic weather system affecting the region, potentially bringing overcast conditions and cooler temperatures in the near term.
