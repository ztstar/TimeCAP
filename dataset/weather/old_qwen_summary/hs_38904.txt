Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting a saturated air mass that contributed to persistent dew point conditions and potential for fog or mist. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, especially in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover and precipitation risk. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeast to east and then northeast, indicating a change in synoptic-scale airflow likely associated with a developing frontal boundary. Together, these trends suggest a weakening of the stable air mass and the potential for thunderstorm development later in the day due to rising instability and moisture convergence.
