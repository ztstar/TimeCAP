Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation likely tied to a stable boundary layer. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before gradually declining, which may indicate the passage of a weak high-pressure system followed by a subtle low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief intensifications throughout the night and morning, while wind direction exhibited variability, shifting from southerly to westerly and then toward the northeast, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow. These patterns together suggest a transition period with increasing instability and potential for afternoon convection, particularly given the high humidity and warming trend, raising the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
