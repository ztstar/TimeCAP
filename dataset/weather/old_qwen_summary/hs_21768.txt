Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and declining sharply during midday, which suggests a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, more convective daytime air. Air pressure showed a general decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a possible approach of a low-pressure system that could enhance instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with an onshore flow that may bring moisture and elevate the risk of afternoon thunderstorms. These combined indicators point to a developing weather pattern conducive to convective activity, warranting attention for potential severe weather later in the day.
