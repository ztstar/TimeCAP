Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly but remaining elevated through the day, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure remained nearly stable throughout most of the period, with a brief drop in the early morning hours, which may suggest the passage of a weak disturbance. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly to easterly wind directions, enhancing moisture transport. These conditions collectively point to a humid, stable air mass with potential for developing afternoon thunderstorms as temperatures rise and instability builds.
