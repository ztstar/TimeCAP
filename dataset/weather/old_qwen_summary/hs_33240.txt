Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a notable warming trend in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more intense daytime heat. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating possible clearing or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the midday, which is characteristic of improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with a complete lull in wind activity, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more northeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air flow. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and increasing wind suggests the onset of a drier, more stable air mass, implying improving conditions with reduced risk of precipitation.
