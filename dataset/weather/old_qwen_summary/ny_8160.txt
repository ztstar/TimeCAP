Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. A notable spike in air pressure occurred in the afternoon, coinciding with a transition from low to high-pressure conditions, which likely brought stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased significantly in the afternoon, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow that may have contributed to the transport of warmer air. Overall, the data reflects a shift from a cool, damp, and unstable night into a warmer, drier, and more stable daytime pattern, typical of a transitioning weather system.
