Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely driven by increasing wind and solar heating. Air pressure exhibited a slight rise in the early hours, followed by a consistent drop in the late afternoon and evening, which may point to the approach of a weak low-pressure system or changing frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the west-southwest, consistent with coastal wind patterns and potentially enhancing sea breeze dynamics. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and westerly sectors, combined with rising wind speeds and decreasing pressure, suggests the onset of a more dynamic weather regime, possibly bringing cloudier conditions or localized fog in the coming hours.
