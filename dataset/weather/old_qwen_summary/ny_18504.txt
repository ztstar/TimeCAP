Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or misty conditions, before dropping significantly during the afternoon, signaling a clearing pattern. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp increase midday followed by a series of drops, suggesting the passage of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, with gusts reaching strong levels, indicating active atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests a change in air mass, likely bringing drier and cooler conditions, potentially marking the end of a damp, sluggish period.
