Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching and sustaining 100% for a prolonged period, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which is typical for the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a shift to a more southerly direction, then strengthened slightly in the late afternoon from the southwest, which can signal a change in marine layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to cool, foggy conditions, especially in the early hours.
