Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily as temperatures increased and winds strengthened. A consistent drop in atmospheric pressure throughout the day suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may indicate increasing instability in the atmosphere. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and southeasterly wind directions, typical of moisture-laden air masses moving inland. These conditions collectively create a high likelihood of scattered to widespread thunderstorms, particularly during the late evening and overnight hours, due to the combination of rising temperatures, high moisture content, and strengthening wind shear.
