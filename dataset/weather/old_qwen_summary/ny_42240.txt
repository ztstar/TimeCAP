Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking shortly before dawn before dropping significantly, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late evening, which typically signals an approaching weather system or changing atmospheric dynamics. Wind patterns showed a notable shift in direction and speed, with calm conditions early in the morning giving way to more variable and stronger winds later in the day, especially in the late evening hours. These combined factors suggest the influence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
