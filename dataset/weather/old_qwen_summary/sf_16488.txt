Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a low point during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, suggesting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southwest to more southerly and then back to southwest, reflecting changing flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool maritime influence toward a drier, more stable regime, typical of the late summer weather cycle in the region.
