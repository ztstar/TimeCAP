Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift from a cold, stable period to a more moderate condition. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or low visibility during those hours. A dramatic increase in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by sustained high pressure, signaling the arrival of a stable, dry air mass that likely brought clearer skies and improved weather conditions. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating changing circulation patterns possibly linked to a passing weather system. These combined factors point to a transition from a cold, moist, and somewhat stagnant air mass to a drier, more stable environment, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and improving overall comfort levels.
