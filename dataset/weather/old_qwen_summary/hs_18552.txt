Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of cooling, with temperatures steadily declining through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. A consistent drop in atmospheric pressure was observed throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate but showed a notable reduction in the late morning, followed by a re-intensification in the afternoon, accompanied by a significant change in wind direction from west to southeast. These patterns collectively point to an active weather front moving into the region, potentially leading to increased cloud cover and the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
