Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning hours before easing slightly in the late afternoon, indicating a likely increase in moisture content in the air. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning hours, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, likely associated with the approaching low-pressure disturbance. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then back to southerly supports the influence of a developing frontal system, which could bring unsettled weather conditions later today.
