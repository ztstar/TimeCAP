Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning and daytime hours, but sharply increased overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping again—suggesting potential fog formation or dew point saturation. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly declining trend during the night and early morning, followed by a sustained low-pressure period, which may signal approaching unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition in atmospheric conditions, possibly leading to deteriorating weather later in the day.
