Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and mist during the early hours, reducing visibility. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent increase, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around dawn, transitioning from light northerly flows to stronger southeasterly winds in the afternoon, which may signal the approach of a moist air mass. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
