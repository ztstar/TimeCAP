Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rebound in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the formation of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the region’s coastal climate. A sharp rise in air pressure during the early morning indicates the arrival of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to stable, clear conditions later in the day. Wind speeds diminished overnight, with near-zero values during the early morning, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon—likely due to a sea breeze developing as land warmed. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly suggests changing atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the influence of coastal dynamics and the transition from marine layer dominance to more open-air conditions.
