Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation in the early hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or dew formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase, which may reflect the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure build-up. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass and possible influence from a developing front. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with potential for changing weather conditions later in the day.
