Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could support cloud formation or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable through most of the period, with a slight increase overnight, signaling generally stable atmospheric conditions, though a minor drop in the final hours may hint at the approach of a weather shift. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent throughout, with a brief reduction in the early morning followed by a return to stronger flow, while wind direction shifted from southeasterly to more northerly, indicating possible changes in air mass movement. These combined factors suggest a transition phase, with increasing moisture and cooling likely setting the stage for potential afternoon thunderstorms or overcast conditions later in the day.
