Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning, peaking near dawn, suggesting increasing moisture content in the air, which may contribute to fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, especially during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late evening, with gusts reaching higher intensities, likely driven by the developing pressure gradient. Wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly and then toward the northeast, reflecting changing air flow patterns consistent with a frontal passage, potentially bringing precipitation or stronger storms later in the day.
