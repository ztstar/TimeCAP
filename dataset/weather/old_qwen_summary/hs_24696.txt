Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to a thick layer of low-level cloud cover and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight overall increase, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has been gradually reinforcing, leading to more settled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to southeast during the night and a notable increase in speed and a shift to the west-southwest in the late evening, potentially signaling the approach of a change in airflow. These combined factors suggest a transition from a moist, stable overnight period to a drier, more unstable daytime regime, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are maintained.
