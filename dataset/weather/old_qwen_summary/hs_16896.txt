Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to nighttime radiative cooling and stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, signaling possible approaching atmospheric disturbances. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and finally to northeasterly, indicating a change in airflow dynamics that may reflect the influence of a weakening boundary layer or a developing local circulation. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if convective instability increases further.
