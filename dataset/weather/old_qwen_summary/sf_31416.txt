Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation or persistent low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling trend. A notable increase in wind speed occurred in the early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the northwest, consistent with a marine air surge typical of coastal upwelling. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the day, particularly in the late evening, which may signal an approaching weather front or low-pressure system. The combination of high humidity, strong winds, and declining pressure points to a transition period likely bringing overcast skies or light precipitation in the near term.
