Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating significant moisture availability in the atmosphere. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching their lowest point in the early hours before beginning a gradual recovery during the afternoon, suggesting a strong nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal fog events. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, followed by a sudden rise, which may signal the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with changing wind patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift from prevailing northwest to more southerly and easterly directions, indicating a change in the large-scale circulation pattern. These conditions together point to a developing or recent fog event, likely driven by marine layer dynamics, with potential for continued cool, damp conditions into the coming hours.
