Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperatures remained consistently cold, with a gradual warming trend observed in the late afternoon and evening hours, suggesting a potential shift in air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before moderating, which may have contributed to fog or low visibility. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to north and then southeast, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends suggest the city is transitioning through a frontal passage, potentially leading to precipitation and variable conditions in the near term.
