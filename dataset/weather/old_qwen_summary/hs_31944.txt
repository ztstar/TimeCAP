Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility during the night. Air pressure remained stable through the night before a notable increase in the midday hours, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more southerly and eventually to a strong westerly flow in the late afternoon, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation that could influence storm development. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, with implications for afternoon thunderstorm potential.
