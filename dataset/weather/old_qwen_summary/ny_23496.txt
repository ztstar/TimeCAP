Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure accompanied by rising humidity and shifting wind patterns indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperatures showed a gradual increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to decline, suggesting a warm front passing through followed by cooler air. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, consistent with the development of a developing storm system. The change in wind direction from southeast to southwest and then to more variable directions reflects the dynamic nature of the frontal passage. These trends collectively suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a stormy period, with potential for precipitation and gusty conditions in the near term.
