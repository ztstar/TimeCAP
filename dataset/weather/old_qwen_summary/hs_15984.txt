Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperature trends showed a gradual increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly in the evening, indicating a warming pattern typical of a developing heat surge. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching near saturation by early morning, which enhances the feeling of mugginess and increases the likelihood of thunderstorm development. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then easterly, suggesting the influence of a developing storm system drawing in moist air. These combined indicators point to a high probability of thunderstorms later in the day or overnight, with potential for heavy rainfall and gusty winds.
