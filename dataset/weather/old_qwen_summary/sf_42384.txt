Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the early hours of the day. Air pressure showed a steady increase, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has begun to stabilize conditions across the region. Wind patterns were highly variable, with strong gusts in the early morning followed by periods of calm and later, more consistent breezes from the southeast and southwest, suggesting shifts in local wind dynamics influenced by topography. The combination of high humidity, dropping temperatures, and variable winds points to a transition from coastal fog conditions toward clearer skies in the coming hours, with potential for improved visibility and milder conditions later in the day.
