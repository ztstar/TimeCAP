Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回升 in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting overnight condensation and potential fog formation, which likely reduced visibility during those times. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from westerly to northeasterly, possibly indicating a change in airflow due to atmospheric pressure gradients. These trends collectively point to a transition toward clearer skies and more stable weather, though residual moisture may still lead to morning fog or light drizzle.
