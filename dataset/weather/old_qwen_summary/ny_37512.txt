Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture content followed by a notable decrease in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the mid-to-late night, accompanied by a shift toward southerly and westerly wind directions, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, potentially leading to precipitation and overcast conditions in the near term.
