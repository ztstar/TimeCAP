Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, typical of the region’s coastal climate. A notable wind shift occurred in the late evening, with strong westerly winds arriving from the Pacific, coinciding with a drop in air pressure and a rise in wind speed, indicating a possible influence from a marine layer or approaching weather system. The persistent low-level wind flow from the northwest and west suggests ongoing coastal upwelling dynamics, reinforcing the cool, moist conditions common along the Bay Area shoreline. These combined factors point to a stable marine layer with potential for foggy mornings and mild temperatures, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
