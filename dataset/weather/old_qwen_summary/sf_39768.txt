Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night, stabilizing in the early morning before a slight rebound, indicating a developing low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were relatively low during the early hours, increasing notably in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns near the coast. These conditions combined to create a foggy, damp environment during the night and early morning, with clearing trends emerging in the late afternoon as winds strengthened and pressure stabilized.
