Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the midday hours before rebounding in the evening, indicating a possible shift in moisture content. Air pressure showed fluctuating patterns with notable spikes during the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of transient weather systems. Wind speeds increased during the overnight and midday periods, with shifts in wind direction reflecting changing airflow, likely influenced by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, breezier weather later in the day, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate behavior.
