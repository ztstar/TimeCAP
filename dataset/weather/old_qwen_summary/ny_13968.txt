Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating possible moisture accumulation and increasing the chance of fog or dew formation. Air pressure rose steadily after midnight, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with brief increases during the late night and early morning, likely driven by localized pressure gradients. Wind directions shifted widely, reflecting changing airflow patterns, with a notable shift toward more southerly and westerly flows in the afternoon, potentially indicating a transition in weather dynamics.
