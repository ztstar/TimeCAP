Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and into the morning, peaking in the late morning, which suggests increasing moisture content and potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent rise until midday, followed by a notable decline, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly during the afternoon, consistent with the transition of air masses. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather pattern, with the potential for changing conditions, including possible rain or storms later in the day.
