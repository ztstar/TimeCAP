Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front during the night hours. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during overnight hours. Air pressure showed a steady increase after a brief dip, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that has since stabilized the weather. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, with gusts from the south-southeast, suggesting strong boundary layer dynamics and possible convective activity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then to southeasterly patterns aligns with a post-frontal adjustment, indicating a transition toward more stable, drier conditions in the coming hours.
