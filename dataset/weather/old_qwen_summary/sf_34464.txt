Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, then dropped during the day before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud formation followed by clearing. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were highest during the early morning hours, driven by a strong offshore component, then diminished through the day before increasing again in the late evening, potentially associated with a shift in local wind patterns. The wind direction transitioned from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing synoptic influences, which may have played a role in the movement of marine air and the evolution of coastal fog.
