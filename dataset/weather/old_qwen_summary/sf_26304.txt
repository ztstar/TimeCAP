Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early dawn, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased dramatically toward the end of the period, with strong gusts recorded in the final hours, likely driven by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the west and northwest, which can enhance coastal upwelling and cooling. These conditions collectively point to a period of unstable, fog-prone weather typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for reduced visibility and chilly conditions, especially near the shoreline.
