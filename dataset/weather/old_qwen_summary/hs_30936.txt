Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nocturnal period into a milder daytime regime. Humidity levels remained elevated, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, which contributed to foggy conditions and a damp, oppressive feel. A notable pressure decrease occurred in the early hours, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night, with gusts from the southeast and later a shift to more northerly and westerly directions, consistent with frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to an active weather pattern that may have facilitated thunderstorm development, particularly during the overnight hours.
