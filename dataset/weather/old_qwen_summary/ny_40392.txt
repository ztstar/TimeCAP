Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before stabilizing, indicating the presence of moist air that could contribute to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained consistently high, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions with little chance of storm development. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast to south-southwest sectors, which may indicate a shift in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds in the later hours points toward improved conditions, with a likely transition to clearer skies by the next day.
