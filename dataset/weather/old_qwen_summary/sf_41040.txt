Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which diminished significantly during midday before rising again in the evening. Air pressure showed a slight rise through the night and early morning, then fluctuated with a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weak weather system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, potentially bringing in marine air and influencing visibility. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly suggests a complex interaction of coastal and regional wind patterns, possibly contributing to changing fog dynamics and temperature variation.
