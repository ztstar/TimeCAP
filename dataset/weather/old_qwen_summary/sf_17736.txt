Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal moderation. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of marine fog or dense low clouds common to the region. Air pressure showed a slow but consistent rise, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable lull in the early morning hours, followed by a return to mild breezes, while wind direction shifted from southwest to more southerly and then westerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the developing high pressure. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward clearer skies and improved visibility, with a likely reduction in fog as the day progresses.
