Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply as temperatures rose and atmospheric pressure began to stabilize. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which was likely associated with the high humidity and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal overnight, with a shift to more consistent easterly to southerly winds in the afternoon, indicating a change in air mass or the influence of developing surface heating. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds late in the period suggests the potential for clearing skies and improved conditions, though residual moisture may support late-day convective activity.
