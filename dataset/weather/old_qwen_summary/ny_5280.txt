Temperatures showed a steady increase throughout the day, indicating a warming trend from early morning into the afternoon, followed by a slight cooling in the late evening. Humidity levels began moderate, rose sharply during the night, and remained elevated through the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased during the night and early morning, reaching a low point before slightly rebounding, which is indicative of an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a peak from the northeast and a shift in direction suggesting changing airflow patterns. These combined trends point to the influence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather, including precipitation, in the near term.
