Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, followed by a sharp drop during the day, suggesting clear skies and drying air as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure system establishing dominance, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were strongest during the early evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the west and then to the north-northwest, indicating changes in atmospheric flow likely associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and weakening winds suggests improving conditions, with the potential for clear skies and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
