Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before declining through the night and remaining low into the early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of morning fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the day, indicating a weakening high-pressure system and potential for increasing cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, suggesting the influence of offshore flow and possible onshore wind shifts. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by increasing moisture, weakening stability, and the potential for developing coastal fog or light drizzle, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas.
