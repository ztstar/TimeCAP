Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and remaining near saturation, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout most of the period, with a slight drop toward the end, suggesting a subtle shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with onshore flow that often brings marine layer conditions. These combined factors point to a persistent marine influence, likely resulting in cool, foggy conditions overnight and the potential for continued overcast skies in the coming hours.
