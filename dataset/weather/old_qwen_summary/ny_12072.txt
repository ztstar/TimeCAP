Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly after midnight, indicating a drying trend that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry weather. Wind speeds diminished substantially overnight and remained low during the early morning before picking up slightly in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from northwest to southeast directions, hinting at a possible change in air mass. Overall, the data indicates a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely resulting in mild to cool temperatures and partly to mostly clear skies in the coming hours.
