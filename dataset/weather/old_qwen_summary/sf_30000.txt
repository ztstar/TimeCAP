Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking around dawn before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the day progressed. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a pronounced low-pressure event in the late afternoon, potentially associated with a shifting weather system approaching from the west. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late night and early morning, with sustained easterly to southerly winds, which likely contributed to the dispelling of marine layer conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the west and south in the final hours implies a possible change in atmospheric flow, possibly signaling the arrival of a new air mass and a transition toward clearer, drier conditions.
