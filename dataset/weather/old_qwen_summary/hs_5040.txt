Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible approaching weather system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, shifting from southerly to easterly and then northerly directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, shifting winds, and a dropping pressure trend suggests the possibility of unstable conditions and the potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
