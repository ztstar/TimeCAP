Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and persisting at near-saturation levels through midday, indicating a saturated environment conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight rise in pressure late in the period may signal improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the southwest, indicating a change in local airflow patterns. These combined conditions suggest a high likelihood of persistent dampness and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, particularly with the warming trend and elevated moisture levels.
