Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from stable nighttime conditions to a drier, more comfortable daytime atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at a change in air mass. Collectively, these changes suggest a weakening of nocturnal inversion and the potential for more dynamic weather later in the day.
