Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which often brings unsettled weather. Temperature remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual increase during the afternoon, suggesting warming trends associated with daytime heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels stayed high throughout the period, particularly in the early hours, contributing to a muggy and oppressive feel, which may have increased the perceived heat. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and westerly, consistent with the development of a frontal system. The combination of falling pressure, rising winds, and persistent high humidity points to an elevated risk of thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term.
