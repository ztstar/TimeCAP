Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually increasing in the late afternoon, indicating a cool night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels were moderate initially but dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air infiltration, which may have contributed to a sharper temperature drop. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, peaking by late evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, increasing in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest the onset of a drier, more stable weather regime, likely leading to improved visibility and mild daytime conditions in the coming hours.
