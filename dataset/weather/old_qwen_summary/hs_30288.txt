Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests an approaching low-pressure system, consistent with the development of unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly directions, with increasing speeds in the late evening, indicating a growing influence from a developing storm system. These combined indicators point to a high probability of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.
