Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moisture-laden air. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, indicating an approaching low-pressure system, which may contribute to unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, consistent with inflow associated with a developing weather disturbance. The shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly supports the presence of a moist onshore flow, raising the potential for isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
