Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a transition from a cooler overnight period to a more moderate daytime condition. Humidity levels surged significantly in the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the presence of moist air, likely from a passing front, which then decreased as temperatures rose, signaling a drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight drop in the early hours, followed by a steady increase, reflecting the passage of a low-pressure system and the subsequent approach of high-pressure dominance. Wind speeds were generally light during the night but increased noticeably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, consistent with changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a shift in weather conditions, potentially clearing skies and improving air quality, with a likely transition to more stable and drier conditions in the coming hours.
