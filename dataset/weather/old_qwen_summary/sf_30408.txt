Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising again. A prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, especially during the overnight hours, indicates the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the cooler, moister conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, potentially enhancing wind chill and dispersing fog. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast and then back to the west and south reflects changing synoptic influences, possibly signaling a transition in weather patterns that could affect visibility and temperature stability in the coming hours.
