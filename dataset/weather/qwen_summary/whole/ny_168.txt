Temperature trends indicate a nocturnal cooling phase followed by a gradual warming, suggesting an overnight low and a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the night and early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, signaling a possible shift in moisture content or air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing to near calm in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in flow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, declining humidity, and reduced winds suggests improving weather conditions, with potential for clearer skies and more stable atmospheric conditions in the near term.
