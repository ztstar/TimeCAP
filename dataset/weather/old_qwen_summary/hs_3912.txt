Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to the sensation of muggy conditions and increased the potential for fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp increase in the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought temporary stabilization and clearing skies. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a shift to more consistent easterly and southerly winds in the afternoon, possibly signaling the onset of a sea breeze or the influence of a developing low-level flow. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and variable wind patterns suggests increasing instability, which could lead to the development of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
