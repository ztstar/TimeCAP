Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of a diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early hours, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, likely signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, followed by a rebound, suggesting stabilization and fairer conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with only brief periods of moderate breeze, and winds shifted from southerly to northerly directions, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable regime, potentially reducing the risk of thunderstorms but maintaining a cool, muggy feel through the night.
