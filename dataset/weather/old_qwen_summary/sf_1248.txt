Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the night before a notable drop in the late evening, hinting at potential changes in weather patterns, possibly the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm, but a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the morning may have facilitated the influx of moist marine air. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to the persistence of a coastal fog regime, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional seasons.
