Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, followed by a sharp decline during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or misty conditions to drier air. A notable rise in air pressure during the late afternoon and evening suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally low through the night, with a brief surge in the early morning and another increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. Overall, the data indicates a transition from cool, moist conditions to warmer, drier weather, likely associated with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge, which may lead to improved visibility and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
