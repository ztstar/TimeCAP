Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were high in the early hours, gradually declining through the day, indicating a drying trend as the air warmed. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds remained low throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to south-southeast, pointing to a change in air mass flow. These patterns suggest an initial stable, humid condition followed by a transition to drier, warmer air, potentially indicating clearing skies and improved conditions later in the day.
