Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a consistent drop during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual rise in the afternoon, suggesting a cooling trend overall with minimal diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours and coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind speeds, and high humidity suggests a likelihood of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions later in the day.
