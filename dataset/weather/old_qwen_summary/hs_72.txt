Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and humidity declined. Air pressure showed a gradual increase throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that may have contributed to stable, clearing conditions later in the period. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, potentially signaling the approach or influence of a developing weather feature. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then westerly suggests changing air mass dynamics, possibly linked to a frontal boundary or a localized storm system impacting the region.
