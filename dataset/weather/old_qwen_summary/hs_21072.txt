Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning, indicating a high moisture content in the air that could contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speed remained consistently strong and uniform, with wind direction shifting gradually from northerly to easterly, suggesting a sustained flow from the Gulf of Mexico. This combination of rising pressure, stable winds, and high humidity suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable daytime conditions, though lingering moisture may increase the chance of afternoon thunderstorms.
