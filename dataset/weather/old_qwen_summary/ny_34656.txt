Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly after midnight, particularly during the morning hours, suggesting a drying trend likely due to a shift in air mass or increased mixing. Air pressure showed a consistent rise throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, likely enhancing the transport of moist air before stabilizing later in the day. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable winds points to a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable conditions across New York City.
