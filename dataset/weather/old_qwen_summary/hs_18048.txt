Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable air to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clear and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low and consistent throughout the night before increasing in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more easterly and southeasterly, possibly signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, calm nocturnal period to a drier, slightly breezier afternoon, which may influence the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
