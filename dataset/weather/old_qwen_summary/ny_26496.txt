Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar radiation. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in the early hours. A gradual decline in air pressure was noted, particularly during the late night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with changing storm dynamics. These indicators collectively suggest the onset of a transition period, possibly leading to precipitation or storms later in the day.
