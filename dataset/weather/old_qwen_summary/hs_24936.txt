Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation around dawn, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during the coolest hours. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning and midday, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, driven by shifting wind directions from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly flows. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increased afternoon wind suggests a transition toward more comfortable conditions, though lingering moisture may support the development of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
