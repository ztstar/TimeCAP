Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal temperature drop, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels were high during the early morning and late night, likely contributing to fog formation, which then decreased during the day as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early and mid-day, peaking before a sharp decline in the late evening, signaling a possible front passage or atmospheric instability. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the evening and early morning hours, with strong, shifting winds from the northwest and southwest, suggesting dynamic air mass interactions. These conditions collectively point to a coastal weather pattern influenced by marine layer development, diurnal temperature shifts, and a potential change in weather systems, with implications for visibility, travel, and outdoor activities.
