Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking and remaining high through the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure exhibited a gradual increase, particularly during midday, which is often associated with improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light in the early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, reflecting changing synoptic patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially signaling the arrival of a drier air mass that could suppress thunderstorm development.
