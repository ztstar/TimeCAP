Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low stratus clouds, a common occurrence in the area during cooler nighttime hours. A notable drop in humidity occurred during the afternoon, coinciding with the rise in temperature and increased wind activity, signaling a possible break in the marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a significant increase in the mid-to-late afternoon, followed by a slight decline, which may indicate a passing weather front or changes in atmospheric circulation. Winds shifted from a southerly to a more westerly direction during the day, with brief bursts of stronger gusts, suggesting dynamic airflow adjustments likely influenced by local topography and coastal breezes.
