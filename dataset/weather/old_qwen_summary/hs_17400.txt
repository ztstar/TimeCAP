Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night before stabilizing in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose steadily during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to a higher chance of fog or light precipitation. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and northeasterly directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow that often brings moisture into the region. These combined conditions point to a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with elevated humidity and increasing wind support for the development of thunderstorms later in the day.
