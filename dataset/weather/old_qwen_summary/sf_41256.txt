Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight rise in the early morning and a dip in the late afternoon, consistent with shifting air masses and possible influence from coastal dynamics. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and east, likely driven by developing thermal gradients and regional pressure differences. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then to southerly patterns points to evolving synoptic conditions, potentially signaling an approaching marine layer or changing frontal influence.
