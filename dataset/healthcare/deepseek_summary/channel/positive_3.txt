- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in testing volume and a notable increase in the rate of rise during the final five weeks. The pattern suggests a significant surge in respiratory specimen testing, likely reflecting heightened influenza activity or expanded surveillance efforts. The recent trajectory indicates a growing public health concern, warranting increased preparedness and potential intervention strategies.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked intensification in the latter half of the period, indicating a rapid increase in influenza A activity. The steep rise in recent weeks suggests the onset of a significant epidemic peak, likely surpassing previous seasonal patterns. This surge underscores the need for heightened surveillance, public health preparedness, and potential intervention strategies to mitigate widespread transmission and healthcare system strain.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked increase in growth rate during the final ten weeks, suggesting a rapidly escalating influenza B circulation. A significant anomaly is observed in the latter half of the series, where values rise sharply beyond previous levels, indicating a possible outbreak or surge in seasonal activity. This pattern implies increasing transmission pressure and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting heightened surveillance and preparedness measures.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator has shown a consistent upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the rate of increase during the final ten weeks. The most significant deviation from earlier trends occurred in the latter half of the period, suggesting a rapid intensification of influenza activity. This sharp rise indicates a likely peak in influenza transmission, with potential implications for healthcare system strain and the need for urgent public health interventions.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a sharp increase in the latter half, suggesting a significant and rapidly growing influenza A activity. The emergence of a pronounced inflection point around week 11 marks the transition from moderate to high levels of positivity, indicative of an impending or ongoing influenza wave. This trajectory implies heightened transmission, potential strain on healthcare resources, and the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, public health messaging, and preparedness measures.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, suggesting a significant increase in influenza B activity. A sharp deviation from previous levels occurred in the last few weeks, indicating the onset of a potential peak or surge in respiratory infections. This pattern implies heightened public health concern, warranting increased surveillance, preparedness, and potential intervention to mitigate transmission.
