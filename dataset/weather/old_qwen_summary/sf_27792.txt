Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of dense fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure peaked in the early morning, suggesting a strong high-pressure system was in place, bringing stable and dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds decreased overnight and into the early morning, then increased in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to northerly, possibly signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions point to a typical coastal pattern, where marine air intrusion and fog are common, influencing both temperature and humidity.
