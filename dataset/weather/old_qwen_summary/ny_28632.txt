Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by daytime recovery. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night, particularly around dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure exhibited a slight fluctuation, with a notable drop in the early hours followed by stabilization, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and midday, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which could indicate changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and calm night to a progressively warmer and breezier day, potentially leading to improved conditions with clearing skies later in the day.
