Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the overnight hours before plummeting dramatically in the late morning, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the morning hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that contributed to the stabilization and drying of the atmosphere. Wind speeds remained generally low during the night and early morning, then strengthened in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly, potentially signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These dynamics point to a typical coastal weather cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics and the movement of high-pressure systems, likely leading to improved visibility and milder temperatures in the near term.
