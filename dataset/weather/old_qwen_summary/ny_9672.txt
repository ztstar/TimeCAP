A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation and possible precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, with stronger gusts from the southwest, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and later to the west-southwest reflects a change in airflow associated with a frontal passage. These conditions collectively point to a transient but impactful weather event, potentially bringing rain or drizzle and cooler temperatures to the city.
