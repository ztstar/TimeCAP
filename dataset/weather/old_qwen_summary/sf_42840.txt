Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming during the morning and afternoon hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though a slight drop in the early hours may have signaled a weakening influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were low overnight, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting direction from the southwest to the west and then northwest, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions—cool temperatures, high humidity, and increasing winds—suggest the potential for coastal fog dissipation during the day, with a transition toward clearer skies as winds strengthen and push marine air inland.
