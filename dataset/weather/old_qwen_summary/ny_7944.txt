Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely brought precipitation and stormy conditions. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the late night and early morning, coinciding with the lowest pressure and consistent wind activity, indicating active moisture transport and potential for rain. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late afternoon before rapidly decreasing, suggesting a passing frontal passage. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to more westerly and then to a southerly pattern, consistent with a storm system moving through the region. These indicators collectively suggest that New York City experienced a transitional weather event, likely involving rain and gusty winds, with conditions beginning to stabilize toward the end of the period.
