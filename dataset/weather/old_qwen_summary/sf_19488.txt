Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, with levels consistently above 95% for more than half the timeframe, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere. Temperatures remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a gradual warming trend observed during the midday hours, suggesting a shift in diurnal patterns. A notable drop in wind speed to near-zero during the early morning hours coincided with a change in wind direction from westerly to southerly, signaling a weakening of the typical coastal flow. Air pressure remained largely steady, with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity but consistent atmospheric stability. The combination of high humidity, minimal wind, and shifting wind direction points to the development of a shallow marine layer, which may contribute to fog formation and cool, damp conditions in coastal areas.
