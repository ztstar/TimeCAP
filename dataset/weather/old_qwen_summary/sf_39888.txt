Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Strong winds from the west to northwest during the early morning hours gave way to calm conditions by mid-morning, with a shift in wind direction later in the day possibly signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest a coastal influence with marine layer development followed by dissipation, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and may presage the return of fog or overcast conditions later in the day.
