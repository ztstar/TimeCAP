Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking at saturation levels during the overnight hours, which suggests a strong potential for fog or drizzle, particularly in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, with no significant drops indicating the absence of an approaching storm system, though slight variations suggest subtle atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger winds from the west to northwest, which may have contributed to mixing near-surface air and aiding in the reduction of humidity later in the day. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly over time hints at a change in air mass, possibly signaling a shift toward drier, more stable conditions as the day progressed.
