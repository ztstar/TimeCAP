Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a noticeable warming trend, with temperatures steadily rising from near-freezing levels to more moderate conditions by late afternoon. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated through the early hours before dropping significantly, suggesting a shift in air mass that may have contributed to clearing skies. A pronounced drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicates the passage of a low-pressure system, likely bringing precipitation and unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with storm development and movement. These combined factors suggest a transient weather front passed through the city, leading to a transition from cold, damp conditions to milder, more stable air by the end of the day.
