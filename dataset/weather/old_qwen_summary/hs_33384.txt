Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog or mist formation during the coolest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight increases during the early morning and midday, pointing to a generally stable atmospheric regime with no immediate indication of storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in airflow patterns, possibly due to local thermal gradients or larger-scale circulation. The combination of high humidity, moderate wind, and warming temperatures in the late afternoon increases the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if further destabilization occurs.
