Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily into the afternoon before stabilizing in the evening. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning hours, dropping significantly in the midday and continuing to decline through the late afternoon, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight decline, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the morning and early afternoon, with a notable reduction in the evening, and wind direction shifted from a northerly to a more easterly flow toward the end of the period. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing pressure indicates improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
