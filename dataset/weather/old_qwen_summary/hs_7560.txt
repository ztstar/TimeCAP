Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high during the overnight and early morning, peaking at saturation before dropping sharply during the midday, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and later to a strong northerly flow, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, particularly from the northwest, which may have contributed to clearing skies and reduced humidity. These changes collectively point to the influence of a passing cold front, likely bringing cooler, drier air and setting the stage for improved conditions in the coming hours.
