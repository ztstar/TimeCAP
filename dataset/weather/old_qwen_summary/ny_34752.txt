Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to an approaching cold front. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which contributed to a damp and muggy feel, increasing the perceived chill. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a transition period between weather systems, though slight drops in the middle of the night may signal the arrival of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally low, but wind direction shifted dramatically from southerly to northeasterly and then to easterly in the latter part of the period, indicating a change in air mass and potential for clearing skies. These combined factors suggest that a cold front has moved through, bringing cooler, drier air and likely clearing conditions, which may result in a crisp, clear morning ahead.
