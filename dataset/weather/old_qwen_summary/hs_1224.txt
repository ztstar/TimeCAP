Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before a sharp drop during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying due to warming and wind shifts. Air pressure showed a gradual increase overnight, stabilizing during the late morning and early afternoon, which is consistent with the approach and dissipation of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and eventually easterly, pointing to a change in large-scale flow patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds suggests improving conditions, with a potential for clearing skies and reduced risk of precipitation in the near term.
