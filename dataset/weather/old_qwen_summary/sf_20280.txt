Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal air mass dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of marine fog and condensation as coastal temperatures dropped. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or change in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased noticeably during the midday and early afternoon, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, likely driven by offshore flow and atmospheric instability. These combined trends point to the influence of a coastal marine layer, with conditions conducive to fog and cooler temperatures, especially in the early morning, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
