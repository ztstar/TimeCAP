Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region's microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity, though a brief rise in the early morning may hint at a passing high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were consistently low, with near-calm conditions during the nighttime, but slight shifts in wind direction—particularly a sudden shift toward the south and southwest in the early hours—could signal the onset of a marine layer or onshore flow. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and persistent marine winds suggests a prolonged period of fog and cool conditions, especially near the coast, which may continue into the coming hours.
