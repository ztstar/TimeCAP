Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual cooling trend during the night, reaching a minimum before warming significantly during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening and early morning, followed by a sustained period of low to moderate pressure, which may indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, potentially signaling a change in wind patterns or storm development. The shift in wind direction from the west to southwest and then to the northwest suggests changing atmospheric dynamics, possibly associated with a frontal passage.
