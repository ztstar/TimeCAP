Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing and gradually rising toward evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night, followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought changes in wind and cloud cover. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a dynamic transition period, likely bringing overcast skies and a higher chance of light precipitation in the near term.
