Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight before sharply dropping during midday, suggesting a transition from marine layer conditions to drier, clearer skies as the sun intensified. A notable rise in air pressure, especially during the late afternoon and early evening, points to the influence of a high-pressure system building in, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and eventually to the west, indicating changing flow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined factors suggest a transition from cool, foggy coastal conditions to a warmer, drier, and more stable environment, typical of a clearing event following a marine layer dissipation.
