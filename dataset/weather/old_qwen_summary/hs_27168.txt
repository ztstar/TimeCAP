Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained high throughout the night, dropping significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the early hours, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover later in the day. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to westerly in the late afternoon, reflecting changing synoptic influences. These patterns suggest the end of a humid, stable period and the onset of more variable, potentially fairer weather conditions in the coming hours.
