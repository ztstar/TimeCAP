Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool overnight period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure during the early hours suggests the approach of a strong high-pressure system, which has since stabilized and brought clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined conditions point to a developing stable weather regime, likely leading to dry, sunny conditions for the next 24–48 hours.
