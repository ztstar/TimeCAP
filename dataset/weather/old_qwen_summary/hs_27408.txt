Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated through the night, dropping sharply in the mid-afternoon before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a significant rise during the night, peaking in the early morning, which may indicate the influence of a high-pressure system moving in. Wind speeds increased moderately through the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south and southeast, signaling changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
