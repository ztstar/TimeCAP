Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant drop in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early and late phases, suggesting moist air masses, with a notable decline in the midday period likely due to warming and air mixing. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, peaking during midday before a sharp drop, signaling the approach and passage of a strong high-pressure system followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to west-northwest, consistent with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a dynamic weather transition, potentially bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the near term, though residual moisture may lead to morning fog or drizzle.
