Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during early morning hours, peaking in the overnight period, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions and gusty winds. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong and variable directions suggesting dynamic atmospheric mixing, particularly from the west and northwest. These combined factors point to a coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with marine influence driving temperature moderation, fog development, and shifting wind patterns.
