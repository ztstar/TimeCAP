Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, followed by a gradual decline as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp increase in the early hours, followed by a sustained decrease, pointing to the passage of a weather front or storm system. Wind patterns shifted from moderate, consistent flow from the south-southwest to stronger, more variable winds from the southwest and west in the evening, potentially signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends suggest a period of unstable weather, with potential for thunderstorms or heavy precipitation, particularly during the overnight hours when humidity was highest and wind activity intensified.
