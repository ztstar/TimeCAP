Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air and increasing potential for precipitation. Air pressure remained elevated and stable, signaling the influence of a strong high-pressure system that generally correlates with clear or fair weather, despite the high moisture. Wind patterns showed significant variability, with periods of strong gusts followed by calm conditions, particularly in the early morning hours, which may have contributed to localized fog or poor air dispersion. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and fluctuating winds points to a possible transition toward overcast or rainy conditions later in the day.
