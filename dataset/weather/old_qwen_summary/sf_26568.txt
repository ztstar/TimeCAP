Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with high values during the early morning hours and a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a significant rise during the night, peaking around mid-morning, which is characteristic of a high-pressure system influencing the area and likely contributing to stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during early morning and late evening hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from marine-influenced, fog-prone conditions to a drier, more stable environment, with potential for improved visibility and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
