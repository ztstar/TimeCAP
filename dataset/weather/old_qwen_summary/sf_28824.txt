Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before gradually rising during the day. A significant spike in humidity occurred during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation levels, indicating the presence of fog or dense moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure exhibited a notable surge during the early morning, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought in moist, unstable air. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with sustained onshore flow in the morning giving way to stronger, more variable winds later in the day, particularly from the west and northwest, which may have influenced the movement of the frontal system. These conditions point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone coastal environment to a more dynamic, potentially storm-affected regime, raising the likelihood of scattered showers or overcast skies in the near term.
