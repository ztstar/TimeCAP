Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by marine air intrusion. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the early hours. A notable pressure decline occurred in the middle of the night, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that brought increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late night and early morning, with strong easterly to southerly winds coinciding with the highest humidity and lowest temperatures, consistent with a coastal upwelling or onshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the afternoon, along with rising pressure and falling humidity, signals a return to drier, clearer conditions, possibly marking the end of the foggy regime.
