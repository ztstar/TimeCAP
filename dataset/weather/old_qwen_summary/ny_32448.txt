Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooler overnight period. Humidity levels increased steadily through the early hours, peaked in the late evening, and then dropped sharply during the afternoon before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible moisture influx. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable spike mid-afternoon followed by a sharp drop, signaling the passage of a weather front that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northwest to west-southwest, which aligns with the pressure change. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to the influence of a dynamic weather system that could lead to variable conditions, including potential for precipitation or clearing skies in the near term.
