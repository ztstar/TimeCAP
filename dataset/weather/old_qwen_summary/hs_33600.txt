Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation around dawn, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind direction occurred in the early morning, transitioning from a consistent southerly flow to variable and more easterly winds, indicating a change in local atmospheric circulation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. The combination of high humidity, decreasing temperatures overnight, and shifting wind patterns implies a higher potential for overnight condensation and possible light precipitation, particularly during the early hours of the day.
