Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and reduced visibility. A steady increase in air pressure, particularly in the late evening, suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, indicating improving and more stable conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a northerly direction to a southeasterly flow by late night, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation that may influence future precipitation chances. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds, and the end of the high-humidity period implies a transition toward clearer and drier conditions in the near term.
