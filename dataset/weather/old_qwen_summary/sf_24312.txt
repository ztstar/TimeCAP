Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure showed a sustained period of high values through the night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop at midday, which may signal the arrival of a weather system or shift in airflow. Wind speeds increased notably during the late morning and evening hours, with strong westerly to southwesterly gusts, consistent with onshore breezes driven by pressure gradients. The combination of falling pressure, shifting wind direction, and rising humidity points to a potential change in weather patterns, possibly bringing increased cloudiness or precipitation in the coming hours.
