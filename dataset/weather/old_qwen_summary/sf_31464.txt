Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, which suggests the presence of marine layer formation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of strong frontal systems, though slight increases in the mid-to-late afternoon may indicate tightening high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were moderate during the morning and evening, with a notable reduction during midday, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, consistent with typical coastal breeze patterns. These conditions point to a stable marine layer regime with potential fog formation overnight and clearing skies by afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
