Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning, persisting near 100% for several hours, indicating strong fog formation or low cloud cover typical of coastal inversions. Air pressure remained stable through much of the night before a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight, with a shift from moderate to light winds, and the wind direction gradually veered toward the southeast, hinting at a shift in local circulation. These conditions collectively point to a stable marine layer with potential for persistent fog or drizzle, particularly in low-lying coastal areas, which could impact visibility and outdoor activities.
