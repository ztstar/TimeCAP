Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained near or at saturation for much of the night, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the prolonged cool conditions. A notable spike in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable, clear conditions but may have also suppressed wind activity. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief but marked increase late in the night, possibly linked to shifting local wind patterns or a brief influx of air from the ocean. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions hints at an evolving sea breeze cycle or influence from regional atmospheric dynamics, which could affect visibility and temperature trends in the coming hours.
