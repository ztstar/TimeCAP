Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the night, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure steadily increased through the night into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and cleared skies by midday. Wind speeds remained low overnight, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with variable wind directions hinting at shifting local circulation patterns. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment to a drier, more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate patterns.
