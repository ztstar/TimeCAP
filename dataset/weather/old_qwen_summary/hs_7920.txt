Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition toward warmer conditions, likely driven by increasing solar heating and wind patterns. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before sharply declining, suggesting a drying trend associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the late morning and midday, followed by a sudden drop in the early evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, with a directional shift from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, aligning with potential convective development. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or elevated convection in the coming hours, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
