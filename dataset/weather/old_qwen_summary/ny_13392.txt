Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting a shift from moisture-laden air to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, potentially enhancing storm development. The combination of rising temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward potentially unstable weather conditions, with possible precipitation or storms in the near term.
