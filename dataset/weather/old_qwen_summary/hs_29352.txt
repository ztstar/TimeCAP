Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend, followed by a steady warming period during the day, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with sustained high values during early morning hours and a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal boundary or convective activity. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest point in the late afternoon, which is typical of an approaching storm system or low-pressure trough. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to southwesterly, consistent with a change in synoptic-scale flow. These combined indicators point to the potential for unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall later in the day.
