Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a significant rise in the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon—consistent with the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southeast to predominantly variable and then to westerly or southwesterly in the evening, aligning with coastal wind patterns and possible offshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a transition period where marine influence dominates, potentially leading to foggy mornings and clearer skies later in the day, with implications for visibility and outdoor activities.
