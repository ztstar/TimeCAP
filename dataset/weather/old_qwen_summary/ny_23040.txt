Over the past 24 hours, a gradual cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels began high and remained elevated overnight, decreasing substantially during the afternoon as the air warmed slightly, suggesting clearing conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the early and mid-day, peaking in the afternoon before declining slightly, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more westerly and northerly wind directions, which typically signals a change in weather patterns. These combined trends suggest that a cold front may have passed through, bringing cooler, drier air and potentially clearing skies, with conditions favorable for a transition to more stable and cooler weather in the coming hours.
