Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the day, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a modest increase during the evening and early night, hinting at the influence of a high-pressure system that may have suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south, likely driven by evolving surface heating and pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a developing afternoon convection risk, with potential for isolated thunderstorms as daytime heating continues to energize the atmosphere.
