Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced consistently high humidity levels, indicating a saturated atmosphere that supports persistent cloud cover and an elevated risk of precipitation. Temperature remained relatively stable during the early and mid-hours before gradually increasing, suggesting a warming trend that may promote convective activity later in the day. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight drop in the late evening, which could indicate the approach of a low-pressure system conducive to storm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, signaling a change in airflow that might bring in moist, unstable air. These combined factors suggest a heightened potential for thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term, particularly if the warming trend continues and instability builds.
