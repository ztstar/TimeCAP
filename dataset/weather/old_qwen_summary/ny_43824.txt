Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low early in the morning before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly through the afternoon, indicating a transition from a damp, cool atmosphere to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief spike during the late night and early morning, and wind direction shifted from northwest to more northeasterly, consistent with a changing airflow pattern ahead of the high-pressure buildup. Collectively, these trends point to a transition from a cool, humid night to a clearer, drier, and more stable afternoon, likely improving visibility and comfort levels across the city.
