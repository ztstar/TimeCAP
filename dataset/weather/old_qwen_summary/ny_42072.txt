Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, with temperatures rising steadily through the morning and peaking during the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, followed by a significant decline in the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the period but began a subtle decline in the late afternoon, indicating the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional gusts, and wind direction exhibited frequent shifts, particularly in the evening, pointing to dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined factors suggest a transition period in New York City's weather, potentially leading to changing conditions such as cloud formation or precipitation later in the day.
