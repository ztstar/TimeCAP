Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels remained low until mid-morning, then surged significantly in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass likely tied to a change in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the night and early morning but decreased during the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast and then toward the east, which may signal the arrival of a frontal boundary. Taken together, these trends suggest a transition from cold, dry conditions to potentially more humid and unsettled weather, with possible precipitation later in the day as the system evolves.
