Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable air. Wind speeds were generally light and variable overnight, but increased during the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could influence the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
