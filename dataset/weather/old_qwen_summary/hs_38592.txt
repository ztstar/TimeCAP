Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from a cool night to a warming afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking in the early morning before declining and stabilizing, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to a passing frontal system. Air pressure showed a marked decline during the night, reaching a low point before slowly recovering, which is consistent with the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought the earlier precipitation or cloud cover. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, with strong southerly to westerly winds indicating inflow of moist air, potentially fueling instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then northeasterly trends suggests a change in the larger-scale flow, possibly signaling the approach of a new weather pattern that could influence future conditions.
