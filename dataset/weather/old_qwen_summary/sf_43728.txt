Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the mid-afternoon before sharply declining through the night, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase during the early evening, reaching near-saturation conditions before dropping significantly later, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds that likely formed as a result of cooling. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure ridge that likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions and suppression of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from moderate southerly to westerly and then southerly again, with brief periods of calm followed by gusty conditions, particularly in the early morning and late evening, which may have influenced fog dissipation and air mixing. These patterns point to a typical marine layer event, with coastal cooling, fog formation, and variable wind behavior consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate dynamics.
