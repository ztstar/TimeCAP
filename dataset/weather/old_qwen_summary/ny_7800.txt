Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system, which is typically associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near dawn, indicating moisture accumulation and the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. The temperature trend showed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a slight rebound in the late afternoon, consistent with the arrival and subsequent dissipation of a cold front. These combined factors point to a period of unstable weather, likely including rain or showers, followed by a clearing trend with cooler, drier air moving in.
