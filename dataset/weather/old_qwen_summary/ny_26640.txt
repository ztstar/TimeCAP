Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels spiked during the early morning hours, indicating a period of near-saturated air, likely due to condensation or fog formation, before dropping sharply as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool morning to a drier, more stable afternoon, with the potential for improving visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
