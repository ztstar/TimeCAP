Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with high values during the night and early morning giving way to dry conditions in the afternoon, culminating in a sharp spike in moisture late in the day—suggesting possible fog formation or precipitation. Air pressure showed a notable rise midday, peaking sharply before declining again, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind patterns displayed strong, persistent onshore flow in the morning and evening, shifting to gusty, variable winds late at night, likely due to localized terrain effects and pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, cooling nights, and potential for changing conditions later in the day.
