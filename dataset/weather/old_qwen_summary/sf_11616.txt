Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before stabilizing in the early morning. A significant drop in atmospheric pressure occurred during the early hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increasing humidity and the eventual onset of fog and light precipitation. Humidity levels surged to near saturation, particularly during the overnight period, indicating favorable conditions for fog formation, a common feature in the region’s microclimate. Wind speeds diminished to near zero during the early morning, suggesting stagnant air that allowed fog to persist and intensify, before gradually increasing again in the late morning. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly may reflect changing synoptic influences, potentially bringing in marine air or disrupting the prevailing onshore flow, with implications for visibility and temperature stability.
