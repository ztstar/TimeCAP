Over the past 24 hours, a steady warming trend was observed, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the arrival of a warmer air mass. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with repeated spikes during nighttime and early morning hours, suggesting periods of condensation or fog formation. Air pressure rose sharply in the midday and remained elevated, signaling stable atmospheric conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period overnight, but increased in intensity during daytime hours, especially in the afternoon. The wind direction shifted dramatically, particularly in the evening, indicating a change in air flow that may have contributed to the observed temperature rise and fluctuating humidity patterns.
