Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the morning hours, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and later evening, suggesting periods of increased moisture availability, possibly linked to atmospheric stability. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and sustained presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a notable decrease in the late morning and afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition toward more settled and stable weather, with low chances of precipitation and improving visibility.
