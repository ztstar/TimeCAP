Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend began in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon and evening, suggesting a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained high in the early hours before dropping significantly through the night, indicating a drying trend likely driven by changing wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, then rose sharply in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially after midnight, peaking in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to westerly and eventually more northerly, consistent with storm development and subsequent clearing. These combined changes point to the passing of a weather front, with conditions now stabilizing under a more settled, drier, and cooler influence.
