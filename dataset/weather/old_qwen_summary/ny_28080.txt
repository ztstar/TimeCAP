Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming during the afternoon, indicating a nighttime cooling trend followed by a slow recovery. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests increasing moisture content and potential for fog or mist formation. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, especially during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to the northeast and then southeast, likely reflecting a change in atmospheric circulation associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined patterns point to the transition from a cooler, more humid, and slightly windy night into a milder, drier, and calmer day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
