Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with prolonged periods of near-saturated air, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a temporary rise midday and a return to baseline, suggesting relatively stable atmospheric conditions with no significant storm systems passing through. Wind activity was variable, with stronger gusts in the morning and evening, often originating from the southwest and shifting toward the northwest and northeast later in the day, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a marine layer-dominated weather pattern, which is typical for the region, likely contributing to foggy conditions and a cool, damp feel throughout the day.
