Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting a period of condensation and possible fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast during the evening, signaling a potential change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests the atmosphere is transitioning, possibly leading to increased instability and the potential for afternoon showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
