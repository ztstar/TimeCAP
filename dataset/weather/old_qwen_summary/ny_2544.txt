Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a cold night with a slow warming trend. Humidity spiked during the early evening, suggesting possible precipitation or moisture buildup, followed by a consistent drop, pointing to clearing skies. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the night and into the morning, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, with a shift in wind direction from west to east, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of these factors suggests a transition from potentially unsettled conditions to clearer, cooler weather as the high-pressure system consolidates.
