Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing and slightly rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to a more oppressive feel despite the cooler temperatures. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the gradual approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from the southwest to the northwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, pointing to improving weather conditions with lower chances of precipitation in the near term.
