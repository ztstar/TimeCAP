Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing influenced by local coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the onset of fog or low cloud cover, which later dissipated as temperatures increased and winds shifted. A notable pressure spike occurred mid-morning, followed by a sharp drop later in the day, signaling the passage of a weather system that likely brought changing conditions and gusty winds. Wind speeds intensified dramatically in the final hours, particularly from the southwest to west-southwest direction, indicating the arrival of stronger offshore flow, likely enhancing coastal breezes and dispersing any lingering fog. These combined patterns point to a dynamic transition from a cool, moist maritime environment to a drier, windier regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
