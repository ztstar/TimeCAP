Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then dropped significantly during the midday, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure rose sharply during the early hours, indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the stabilization and clearing of skies. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with a calm period around dawn, but increased significantly in the late afternoon, particularly from a westerly to southwesterly direction, hinting at a change in air flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, damp, and calm maritime influence to a warmer, drier, and breezier regime, typical of a developing afternoon sea breeze pattern.
