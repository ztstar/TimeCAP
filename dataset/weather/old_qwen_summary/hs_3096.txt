Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening hours, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity remained high in the early morning and gradually decreased through the day, suggesting a drying trend as air warmed and mixing increased. A notable drop in atmospheric pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a stabilization, which may signal the passage of a weather system and potential for changing conditions. Wind speeds were initially moderate and then diminished, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and later to southerly-southwesterly, indicating possible reorganization of local circulation. These changes collectively suggest that Houston transitioned from a stable, moist environment to a warmer, drier one, potentially increasing the risk of heat stress and setting the stage for possible convective activity later in the day.
