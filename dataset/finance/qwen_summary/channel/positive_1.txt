- S&P 500: The S&P 500 has demonstrated a clear upward trajectory over the past 20 market days, with sustained momentum following an initial sharp rise, indicating strong bullish sentiment. A notable consolidation phase occurred mid-period, marked by minor fluctuations and a brief pullback, suggesting short-term profit-taking before resuming gains. The recent acceleration in the final days, especially a sharp breakout above prior resistance levels, signals increasing market confidence and potential for continued upward momentum.
- VIX (Volatility Index): The volatility index has exhibited a pronounced downward trend over the past 20 market days, reflecting a sustained reduction in market fear and heightened investor confidence. A notable spike in the middle of the period was followed by a sharp decline, suggesting a temporary disruption in sentiment that was quickly resolved. The recent sustained low levels indicate a potential shift toward a calmer market environment, which may signal reduced risk premiums and increased appetite for equities, though vigilance is warranted for any signs of renewed turbulence.
- Nikkei 225: The index has demonstrated a generally upward trajectory with persistent volatility, marked by repeated intraday and interday fluctuations that suggest ongoing market uncertainty.
