Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A sustained drop in air pressure, particularly during the night, indicates the influence of a low-pressure system moving through the region, consistent with the onset of overcast conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief increases in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by variable wind directions—suggesting shifting airflow patterns associated with the approaching system. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and falling pressure points to a persistent marine layer and potential for foggy, damp conditions throughout the day.
