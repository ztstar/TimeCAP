Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a slight recovery in the final hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nighttime radiative loss and changing air mass dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation as temperatures cooled below the dew point. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decrease through the night, reaching a low point before a slight rebound, which is often associated with approaching frontal systems or low-pressure development. Wind speeds increased steadily through the evening and nighttime, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in dominant air flow possibly linked to a developing synoptic-scale disturbance. Taken together, these trends suggest the atmosphere is becoming more unstable, raising the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly during the afternoon hours when heating could further enhance convection.
