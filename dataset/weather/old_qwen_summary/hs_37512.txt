Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating cycles. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that could have supported fog or mist formation, with a sharp drop in moisture content during midday. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which is often associated with the passage of a high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overall, with a significant increase during the late evening and overnight hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, potentially reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
