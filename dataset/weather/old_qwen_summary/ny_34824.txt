Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking sharply before dropping rapidly as the day progressed, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure exhibited a slight decline in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with the movement of a frontal boundary. These combined trends suggest the potential for unsettled weather later in the day, including possible precipitation.
