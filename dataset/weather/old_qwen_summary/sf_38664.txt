Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a sustained increase, indicating the passage of a weather system and the approach of more stable conditions. Wind activity was strongest during the night and early morning, with southerly and westerly flows giving way to nearly calm conditions by mid-morning, then shifting to light northerly winds later in the day. The combination of warming temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing pressure signals a shift toward a drier, more settled weather pattern, likely clearing lingering coastal fog.
