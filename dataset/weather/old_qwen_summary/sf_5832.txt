Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decline overnight, followed by a minor drop in the late afternoon, suggesting possible atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the south to the west-southwest, consistent with a marine layer influence. These patterns collectively suggest a strong marine layer effect, contributing to cool, foggy conditions overnight and gradually clearing as daytime heating and wind patterns shift.
