Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before steadily declining, suggesting the presence and subsequent dissipation of a dense fog layer that likely formed due to the temperature inversion. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the night, stabilizing at a high level through the early morning, then dropping sharply in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds remained light throughout the night and early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow that likely contributed to the onshore transport of maritime air. These combined trends point to the influence of a coastal marine layer that formed overnight, dissipated during the day, and may be giving way to a shift in air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions in the near term.
