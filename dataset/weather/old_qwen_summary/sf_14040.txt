Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which diminished sharply during midday, indicating clearing skies. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a brief rise in the early afternoon followed by a sustained decline, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing conditions. Wind activity was most intense in the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by coastal dynamics and sea breeze influences. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late afternoon suggests a possible change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the approach of a new air mass.
