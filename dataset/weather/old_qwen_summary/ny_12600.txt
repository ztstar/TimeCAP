Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend from early morning through midday, followed by a gradual decline in the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, beginning low, peaking in the late night and early morning, then dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting moisture content changes linked to temperature shifts. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night, reaching a minimum before slowly recovering, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger winds from the southwest to west, likely driven by the dynamic pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, combined with the drop in pressure and rising temperatures, points to a developing storm system that may bring precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
