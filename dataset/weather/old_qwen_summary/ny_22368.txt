Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then dropped sharply during the midday, indicating a transition to drier air, likely due to descending air from a high-pressure system. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from the west-southwest to the west-southwest and then to the west, consistent with storm-related circulation. These combined factors suggest that New York City experienced a dynamic shift from cool, humid conditions to a drier, windier environment, increasing the likelihood of precipitation or storms in the near term.
