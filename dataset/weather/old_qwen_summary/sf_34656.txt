Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping steadily into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a significant increase in moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around dawn, with wind speeds decreasing dramatically during the late night and early morning hours, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, suggesting changing atmospheric stability. The wind direction became more variable during the overnight period and stabilized toward the afternoon, aligning with a shift toward onshore flow that may have brought in marine air. Combined, these indicators point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone marine layer to a more dynamic coastal atmosphere, with potential for clearer skies and increasing afternoon breezes.
