Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperature trends show a steady decline through the night, followed by a slight recovery in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels were consistently high overnight, peaking before dropping sharply as the low-pressure system moved through, which aligns with precipitation events. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, consistent with the changing pressure gradient and storm dynamics. These combined indicators point to a transitional weather pattern, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible rain or thunderstorms, to New York City in the near term.
