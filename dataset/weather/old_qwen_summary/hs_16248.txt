Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, indicating the influence of a moist air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest during the night, consistent with a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, more comfortable daytime, with minimal risk of precipitation or severe weather.
