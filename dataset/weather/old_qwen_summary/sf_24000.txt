Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, contributing to a damp and foggy feel, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, before dropping significantly during midday. A strong shift in wind patterns occurred in the late evening, with sustained high wind speeds from the west and northwest, indicating the influence of a coastal upwelling or approaching marine layer. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for persistent fog and cool conditions through the night, with possible impacts on visibility and travel.
