Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回升, indicating a cooling trend that later reversed with warming. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting high and dropping sharply during the afternoon, which suggests a possible shift from moist to drier air, potentially signaling a change in weather systems. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest to west sectors, consistent with the influence of a developing high-pressure ridge. These combined trends suggest that New York City is transitioning into a drier, more stable, and gradually warming weather pattern, with reduced cloud cover and improved visibility expected in the coming hours.
