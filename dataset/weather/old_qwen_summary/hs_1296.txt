Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped significantly overnight, reaching a low in the early morning before beginning to rise again, indicating a drying trend that may have contributed to increased comfort but also potential for elevated fire risk. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with a strong gust in the pre-dawn period, followed by a marked decrease later in the day, reflecting a shift toward calmer conditions. Wind direction shifted from northerly to more easterly and southerly orientations, hinting at changing air mass dynamics that could signal the approach of a moist, potentially unstable air mass later in the day.
