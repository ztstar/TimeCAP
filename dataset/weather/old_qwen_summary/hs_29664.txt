Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility in the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a weather system, possibly associated with a front or thunderstorm development. Wind speeds increased during the late evening and early morning, with a shift toward southerly to easterly directions, suggesting the influx of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Combined, these indicators suggest a high likelihood of unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
