Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near dawn before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure exhibited a steady rise through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before a sudden drop in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a front or disturbance. Wind speeds remained low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by the pressure changes. The shift in wind direction from predominantly west-northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors points to a change in air mass, potentially bringing less stable, warmer air in the coming hours.
