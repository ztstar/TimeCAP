Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from a dry to a moist air mass. A temporary atmospheric pressure spike occurred mid-morning, suggesting the passage of a short-lived high-pressure system, followed by a sustained drop, which may signal an approaching weather change. Wind patterns shifted from westerly to southerly and then back to westerly, with consistent low speeds, implying stable but evolving air flow. These combined factors suggest the potential for fog development in the early morning hours and a possible shift toward clearer skies later in the day, consistent with typical coastal San Francisco weather dynamics.
