Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating strong moisture presence in the atmosphere. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching their lowest point just before dawn, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of diurnal heating and possible fog dissipation. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midday, with wind speeds dropping to near zero and directional changes indicating a weakening of prevailing onshore flow, which may have contributed to fog retention and reduced mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then began to fall in the late afternoon, signaling a potential change in weather systems approaching from the west. Combined with the high humidity, low wind speeds, and temperature trends, these indicators suggest the lingering presence of marine layer conditions, which could result in foggy mornings and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
