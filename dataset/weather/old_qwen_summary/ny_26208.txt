Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and overnight hours, contributing to a damp and foggy feel, before dropping significantly in the midday period. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early night, with gusts reaching higher intensities, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northerly sectors, which may signal changing air mass influence. Overall, these patterns suggest the remnants of a moist, unstable air mass clearing out, potentially leading to improving conditions with a chance of clearing skies by morning.
