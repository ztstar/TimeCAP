Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, coinciding with a rise in humidity and a shift in wind direction, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. High humidity levels, particularly during the night and early morning, contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, while wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening. The wind direction shifted from northeasterly to southeasterly and then to more easterly, suggesting the influence of a developing onshore flow typical of Gulf moisture intrusion. These patterns point to a transition toward a more humid and potentially unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
