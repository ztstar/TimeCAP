Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests fog formation and possible low-lying cloud cover, consistent with the city's marine layer behavior. Air pressure rose significantly overnight, reaching a peak before stabilizing, reflecting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the foggy conditions and stable atmospheric layering. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the northeast during the early morning hours, which may indicate a change in the boundary layer dynamics or the influence of local topography. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and weak winds points to persistent marine layer conditions, likely resulting in overcast skies and cool temperatures, with potential for lingering fog into the morning.
