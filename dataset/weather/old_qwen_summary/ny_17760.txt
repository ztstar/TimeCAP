Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, then sharply declined during the midday hours, suggesting the arrival of drier air as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, with a shift to more consistent southerly and easterly winds in the afternoon, likely enhancing the warming trend. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and stable high pressure points to a transition toward clearer, drier, and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
