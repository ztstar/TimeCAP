Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a more dynamic daytime atmosphere. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a frontal system or low-level convergence. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the latter half of the period, especially during the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from light northerly flows to more variable and stronger southerly winds in the evening, likely promoting the influx of warmer, moister air. These combined indicators suggest the potential for precipitation and changing conditions in the near term, warranting attention for possible storms or rain later in the day.
