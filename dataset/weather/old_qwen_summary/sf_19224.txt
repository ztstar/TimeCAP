Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours. Temperature remained relatively stable with a slight cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual rise in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting a stable thermal profile influenced by marine layer dynamics. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, with wind directions shifting from westerly to more southerly and easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns around the developing high-pressure ridge. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a gradually clearing and more stable environment, typical of the late morning shift in San Francisco’s microclimate.
