Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-morning and then gradually declining, suggesting the influence of a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may signal the approach of a changing synoptic pattern. These combined factors suggest increasing atmospheric instability, potentially leading to the development of afternoon thunderstorms as the day transitions into evening.
