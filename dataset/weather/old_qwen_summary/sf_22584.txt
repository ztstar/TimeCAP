Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels increased markedly after midnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating a shift toward more moist air, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day before showing a gradual rise, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly, pointing to changing flow patterns near the coast. These combined factors suggest a transition from cooler, damp conditions to potentially drier and more stable air, which may lead to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
