Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the day, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may indicate the influence of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night and early morning, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, hinting at changing atmospheric flow. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a stable, cool, and humid overnight period to a drier, warmer, and more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convection or thunderstorm development.
