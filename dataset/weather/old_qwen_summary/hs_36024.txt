Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, indicating the possible passage of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to changing weather conditions. Temperature trends showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual rise in the afternoon, suggesting a cooling trend overnight and warming during the day, typical of diurnal cycles with possible frontal influence. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, remaining elevated through mid-morning before sharply dropping, signaling a shift from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions, possibly due to a change in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in direction from northerly to southerly, which may reflect the influence of a developing storm system or outflow boundary. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a dynamic weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of unsettled conditions, including potential thunderstorms, especially given the rapid pressure drop and strong wind shifts observed.
