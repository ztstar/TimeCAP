Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from a cold front to a more stable air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass after a period of high moisture. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the latter half of the period, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is often associated with the approach and subsequent passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by the developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then southerly patterns indicates the influence of a changing synoptic-scale flow, potentially heralding a shift in conditions toward more unsettled weather.
