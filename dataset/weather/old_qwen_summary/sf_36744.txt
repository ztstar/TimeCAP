Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, remaining near saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher levels, particularly from the southeast and south-southwest, indicating a shift in local wind patterns possibly linked to coastal dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool maritime environment to a drier, breezier regime later in the day, which could influence both outdoor comfort and potential for wildfire risk.
