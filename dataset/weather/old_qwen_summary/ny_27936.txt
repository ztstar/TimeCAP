Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, potentially clearer air. Air pressure remained relatively low and variable, with notable dips during the night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light with brief increases in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, consistent with a developing or dissipating weather system. These trends collectively point to a transition period in the weather, possibly leading to improved conditions in the coming hours with the potential for clearer skies and cooler temperatures.
