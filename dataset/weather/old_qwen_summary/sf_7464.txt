Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the onset of a drying phase likely associated with offshore air flow. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, followed by a sustained drop in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather dynamics. Wind speeds remained low through the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly, potentially indicating a change in regional circulation patterns. Together, these trends suggest the arrival of a transitional weather pattern, possibly bringing cooler, drier air, with implications for fog dissipation and improved visibility in the coming hours.
