Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, then decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting a warming trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period but experienced a slight downward trend in the late evening, potentially signaling changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief increases during the day, and wind direction shifted notably from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, indicating shifting air masses. These patterns suggest a transition from cooler, more humid conditions to a warmer, drier atmosphere, possibly preceding a change in weather systems.
