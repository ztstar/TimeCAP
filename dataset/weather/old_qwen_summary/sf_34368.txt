Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability likely due to marine air intrusion. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no strong frontal systems passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and late evening, with consistent southerly to westerly wind directions, reflecting the influence of the prevailing sea breeze and offshore flow. The combination of rising humidity, cooling temperatures, and persistent wind patterns points to a high likelihood of fog formation, particularly during the pre-dawn and early morning hours, which is characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate.
