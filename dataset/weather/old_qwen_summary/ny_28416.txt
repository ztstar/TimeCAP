Temperature showed a gradual increase over the 24-hour period, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late morning and afternoon hours. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture levels, culminating in near-saturation conditions, which enhances the perception of dampness and may contribute to fog formation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight decline, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief intensifications during midday and early evening, while wind direction shifted from predominantly northerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns likely associated with advancing weather systems. These combined factors suggest a transition toward milder, more humid conditions, with potential for fog or drizzle in the early morning hours and improving clarity later in the day.
