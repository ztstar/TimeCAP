Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day, indicating a transition from a cold, stable air mass to a more moderate one. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the night, peaking in the late afternoon, which suggests increasing moisture content and potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwesterly, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. These patterns collectively indicate a dynamic weather shift, likely associated with an approaching frontal system that could bring rain or snow, depending on the temperature profile.
