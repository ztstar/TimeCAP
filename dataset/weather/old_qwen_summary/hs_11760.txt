Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, indicating a saturated atmosphere that favors the formation of fog and persistent cloud cover. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to increased cloudiness and precipitation risk. Wind speeds intensified through the night, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, suggesting the influence of a changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined factors point to a high likelihood of overcast conditions and potential for light rain or drizzle, especially during the early morning hours.
