Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating increasing solar heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, frequently reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight fluctuation, with a brief drop during the late night followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a weak low-pressure system or local atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, especially from the southeast and east, suggesting a shift in airflow that may have contributed to the warming trend and helped disperse overnight moisture. Combined, these conditions point to a humid and increasingly unstable atmosphere, raising the potential for isolated thunderstorms or heavy downpours later in the day.
