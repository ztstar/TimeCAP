Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining steadily through the night before modestly rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, reaching near-saturation levels, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained stable throughout most of the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest toward the west-southwest, suggesting the arrival of a more dynamic flow from the Pacific. These conditions point to a coastal marine influence, with cool, moist air prevailing—typical of San Francisco’s microclimate—potentially leading to continued fog and cool temperatures into the coming hours.
