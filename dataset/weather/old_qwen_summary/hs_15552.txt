Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of stable air and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night into the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought calm and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight and into the morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly in the late afternoon, indicating a change in air mass movement. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, increasing the potential for afternoon convective activity as the day progresses.
