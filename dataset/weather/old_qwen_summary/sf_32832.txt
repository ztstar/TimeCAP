Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity remained high during the early hours, then sharply decreased in the mid-morning, indicating a possible shift in air mass or the onset of a drying influence. Air pressure rose steadily through the evening and overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the nighttime hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and southerly, consistent with the approach of a coastal front or change in synoptic flow. The combination of cooling temperatures, increasing pressure, and changing wind patterns points to the arrival of a more stable, drier air mass, likely leading to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
