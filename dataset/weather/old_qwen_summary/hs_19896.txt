Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, reaching saturation in the early morning and remaining near maximum, which suggests the presence of stable, moist air and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly after midnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, indicating a change in airflow that may have facilitated the influx of moist maritime air. These combined factors point to a transition toward more humid, stable, and potentially overcast conditions, with reduced wind by late morning, which could allow fog or light precipitation to persist into the day.
