Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or the influence of a passing front. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a sharp increase in the early morning, which may indicate the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable lull during the early morning hours, followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast, which could signal the onset of a sea breeze. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to more southeasterly patterns indicates changing flow dynamics, potentially contributing to the observed temperature and humidity fluctuations.
