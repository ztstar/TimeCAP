Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating saturated conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing weather. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable surge in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east, consistent with boundary layer adjustments. These patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal regime to a more dynamic and potentially clearing daytime environment.
