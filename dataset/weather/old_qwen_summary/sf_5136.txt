Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. A pronounced drop in humidity occurred in the early hours, followed by a return to higher moisture levels in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a shift in air mass or fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before subsiding, with winds shifting from southerly to westerly directions, consistent with coastal wind patterns. These changes collectively suggest the influence of a marine layer that dissipated during the day, contributing to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier, and breezier weather.
