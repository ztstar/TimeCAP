Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests nocturnal dew point rise and potential for fog formation under calm conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief spike during the evening, associated with a shift in wind direction toward the south-southeast, possibly indicating the onset of a frontal influence. Taken together, these indicators suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially storm-prone conditions in the coming hours, particularly with the combination of rising temperatures, elevated humidity, and weakening pressure.
