Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming phase in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a drier air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before a slight recovery, which is often associated with the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and eventually northerly, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. These combined factors point to an active weather transition, likely involving a frontal passage, with potential for unstable conditions and localized storms later in the day.
