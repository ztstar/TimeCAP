Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a shift toward more unstable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching saturation during the early morning and dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting possible convective activity. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the day, culminating in a peak just before the evening hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind patterns displayed variability in both speed and direction, with stronger gusts and shifts toward more southerly and easterly flow in the late afternoon and evening—conditions conducive to moisture transport and potential thunderstorm development. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, strengthening winds, and a strengthening high-pressure system points to a period of increasing atmospheric instability, raising the likelihood of isolated or scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
