Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during early morning hours, peaking in the predawn period, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the early hours, followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon, signaling the possible passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the midday and early evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, likely driven by pressure gradients associated with the frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast and then back to the northeast implies a dynamic change in air mass, potentially bringing unsettled conditions later in the day.
