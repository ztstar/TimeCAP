Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained high through the night, sharply decreasing in the early morning before rebounding later, indicating a shift from stable, moist air to drier conditions. Air pressure plummeted during the overnight hours, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which is characteristic of a passing low-pressure system associated with stormy weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early afternoon, with strong gusts from the southeast, consistent with an active weather front moving through the region. Combined with variable wind directions and a brief period of calm, these changes point to dynamic atmospheric conditions that likely brought precipitation and gusty conditions earlier in the day.
