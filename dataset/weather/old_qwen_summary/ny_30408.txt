Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder day. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the potential for fog or low visibility during those times. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, stabilizing around a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and eventually to the south-southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric flow that may signal the approach of a weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving conditions, with a likely transition to clearer, drier weather in the coming hours.
