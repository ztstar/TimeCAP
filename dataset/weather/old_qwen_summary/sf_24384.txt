Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a damp and foggy atmosphere typical of the region’s coastal climate. A notable decrease in air pressure during the late night and early morning suggests the influence of a low-pressure system, potentially associated with marine layer development and overcast conditions. Wind patterns shifted from strong westerly and southwesterly flows in the evening to more variable and weaker winds by dawn, with a brief surge in speed and a change to southerly directions in the mid-afternoon. These combined elements indicate a persistent marine influence, with likely continued fog and cool conditions through the day, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas.
