Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late night and early morning, suggesting increasing moisture in the air, possibly due to cooling and condensation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the last several hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest the onset of a stormy weather pattern, with potential for precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
