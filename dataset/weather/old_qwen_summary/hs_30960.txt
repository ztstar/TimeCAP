Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nighttime low temperatures to a building diurnal high. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, before dropping significantly during the late afternoon. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a notable decline in the late evening, suggesting possible approaching atmospheric instability or a developing low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including a shift toward more southerly and easterly flows, which may indicate the onset of a frontal passage or convective activity. These combined conditions—rising temperatures, fluctuating pressure, and increasing wind—point to a potential for thunderstorm development or changing weather patterns in the near term.
