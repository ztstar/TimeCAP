Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the late night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, driven by a shift in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly sectors, suggesting the onset of onshore flow and potential for coastal breezes. These combined patterns point to a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone night to a potentially clearer, windier day as the high pressure continues to dominate.
