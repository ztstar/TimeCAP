Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature followed by a gradual rise, indicating the passage of a cold front early in the period. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility, particularly during early morning hours. Air pressure declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum around midday, signaling the influence of a low-pressure system that brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, suggesting a change in airflow associated with the frontal passage. These combined factors point to a period of stormy weather with potential for precipitation, especially given the high moisture content and dynamic atmospheric pressure changes.
