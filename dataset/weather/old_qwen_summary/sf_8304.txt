Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating strong condensation potential and likely contributing to fog formation, which persisted into the early morning. A significant drop in air pressure during the night and early morning suggests the passage of a low-pressure system, consistent with the increase in cloud cover and reduced visibility. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout most of the day, except for a brief spike in the late afternoon, driven by a shift toward westerly and southerly winds, which may have brought in maritime air. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind direction points to a dynamic marine layer influence, likely responsible for the persistent fog and cool conditions typical of the region’s microclimate.
