Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels remained low during the initial hours but surged dramatically overnight, peaking at near saturation and persisting into the morning, indicating significant moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then northeast, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and potentially foggy conditions as morning progresses.
