Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight and early morning hours, contributing to a damp and muggy feel, before dropping significantly during the midday as the air became drier. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early morning hours, peaking just before midday, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief period of stronger gusts during the night, followed by calm conditions in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting reduced atmospheric mixing. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast in the morning hints at a change in air mass, potentially marking the passage of a cold front and setting the stage for cooler, drier weather in the coming hours.
