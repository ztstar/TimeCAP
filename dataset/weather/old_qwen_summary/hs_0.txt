Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, signaling a significant warming trend likely driven by solar heating and changing wind patterns. Humidity levels declined steadily throughout the day, especially after midday, indicating a drying trend that could increase comfort levels but also elevate fire risk. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential approach of a low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds intensified in the evening, with a marked shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northwest and then to the north-northwest, pointing to a change in atmospheric flow that may precede a weather shift. These combined trends suggest the possibility of unstable conditions later in the day, potentially leading to afternoon thunderstorms or a change in weather patterns.
