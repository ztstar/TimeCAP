Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning a decline, indicating a period of saturated air likely associated with fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly during the morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more northeasterly, reflecting changing local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the city transitioned from a cool, foggy, and damp morning to a clearer, milder afternoon with increasing stability, typical of coastal weather patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics.
