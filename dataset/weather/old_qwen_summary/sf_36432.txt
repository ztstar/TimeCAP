Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a sharp spike in the early hours indicating possible fog formation, followed by a gradual decrease as the day progressed. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with strong gusts from the northwest and later from the south-southeast, indicating shifting wind patterns typical of coastal dynamics. These conditions collectively point to an active weather transition, likely involving fog dissipation and the potential for incoming precipitation or storm activity later in the evening.
