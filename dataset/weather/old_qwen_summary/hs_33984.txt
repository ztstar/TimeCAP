Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the onset of a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels remained persistently high throughout the night and early morning, then sharply declined in the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air, likely associated with a change in wind patterns. Air pressure showed a steady decline in the late afternoon and evening, followed by a slight recovery, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a developing disturbance. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon and shifted from southerly to easterly and southeasterly directions, consistent with a boundary layer adjustment or the influence of a developing sea breeze. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
