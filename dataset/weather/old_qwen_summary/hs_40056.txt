Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly declining. Humidity levels climbed significantly during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation before gradually decreasing, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure showed a slight decline during the night and early morning, followed by a recovery, which may indicate the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast direction, potentially contributing to heat advection and reduced air quality. These combined factors point to an unstable, humid, and warming atmosphere, which could increase the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if additional lift mechanisms develop.
