Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity increased steadily through the early hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation and subsequent dissipation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high value, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning hours, shifting from a westerly to a southerly direction, then easing, indicating a dynamic change in local wind patterns. These combined trends point to a transition toward clearer and more stable conditions, with potential for mild temperatures and reduced precipitation risk in the near term.
