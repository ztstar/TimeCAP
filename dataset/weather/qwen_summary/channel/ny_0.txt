- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a steady decline over the first 16 hours, indicating a consistent drying trend, likely due to atmospheric subsidence or a shift in air mass. A sharp and significant drop occurred between the 16th and 19th hour, followed by a partial recovery, suggesting a transient influence such as a passing front or localized convective activity. The pronounced dip and subsequent rebound may signal a brief period of unstable air, potentially increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms later in the day.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has remained stable at a consistent level for the majority of the past 24 hours, indicating a period of atmospheric stability. A brief drop occurred approximately 6 hours ago, followed by a recovery and a subsequent rise, suggesting the passage of a weak pressure system or localized atmospheric disturbance. The overall pattern points to a transitioning weather regime, with potential implications for changing weather conditions in the near term.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady, gradual increase throughout the initial 16 hours, indicating a sustained warming trend likely driven by daytime heating or atmospheric changes. A sharp and significant jump occurred between the 15th and 16th data points, followed by a rapid rise to a peak, suggesting a sudden meteorological event such as an influx of warm air or a localized heat pulse. After reaching its maximum, the temperature declined sharply and consistently, returning toward earlier levels, which may indicate cooling due to evening conditions or a dissipating heat source.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a sustained period of stability at a moderate level, followed by a sharp decline to near-gusting conditions, indicating a significant weakening of wind activity. A notable anomaly occurred with a sudden drop to minimal values, interrupted by brief spikes, suggesting localized or transient atmospheric disturbances. The erratic fluctuations toward the end of the period imply possible changes in local wind dynamics, potentially linked to shifting pressure systems or urban microclimatic effects.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction has exhibited a consistent shift from a southerly to a more westerly quadrant over the past 24 hours, indicating a gradual change in prevailing airflow. A notable abrupt deviation occurred mid-period, with a sharp swing toward a northerly direction before rebounding to a more southerly orientation, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or localized atmospheric disturbance. This fluctuation implies dynamic weather conditions, potentially signaling instability or changing pressure gradients influencing the region.
