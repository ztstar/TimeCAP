Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable daytime heating patterns. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the late night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which may have contributed to a muggy feel and potential for localized fog or low clouds. A consistent decline in atmospheric pressure throughout the day suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring increased chances of precipitation later. Wind speeds remained minimal until late evening, when they increased significantly and shifted from a northeasterly to a southerly direction, indicating a change in air flow that may facilitate moisture transport into the region. These combined trends suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms or heavy showers in the near term, particularly if the incoming system consolidates with existing moisture.
