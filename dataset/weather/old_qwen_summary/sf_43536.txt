Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels saw a marked increase after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture intrusion typical of coastal conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, indicating a possible approaching weather system, with a notable drop in the final hours that may signal changing conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly and southerly directions to more variable and weaker flows overnight, with a brief strengthening in the late evening. These combined factors point to a transition period likely bringing foggy, cool conditions with potential for increased cloud cover and a marginal risk of light precipitation.
