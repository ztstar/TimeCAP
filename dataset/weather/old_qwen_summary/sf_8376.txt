Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual decline, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion. A notable pressure spike occurred in the early morning, followed by a rapid drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front that likely brought the cooler, moister conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with a changing synoptic pattern. These combined factors point to a coastal fog event influenced by onshore flow and temperature inversion, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
