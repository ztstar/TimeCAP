Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend in temperature, with the lowest readings occurring in the early morning hours, indicating a period of nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable increase, particularly in the mid-morning, stabilizing at a high level, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region and promoting clear, stable conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low until mid-morning, when they increased and were sustained, accompanied by a gradual shift in wind direction from northwest to southerly, suggesting a change in air mass movement. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist, and stable environment toward a drier, more settled atmosphere, with likely improving visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
