Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining, especially during the early morning hours, indicating a persistent cold air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the evening before dropping sharply overnight, followed by a resurgence in the late morning, suggesting possible frontal activity or air mass changes. Air pressure showed a marked decrease in the middle of the period, followed by a recovery, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system through the region. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early and late phases, with strong, shifting winds from the south and southwest, consistent with storm development and frontal passage. Combined with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly, these indicators suggest a dynamic weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and potentially stormy conditions to the city.
