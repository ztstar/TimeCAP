Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and low wind conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping sharply in the midday hours, suggesting a shift toward drier air as surface heating intensified. Air pressure showed moderate fluctuations, with a notable decrease in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or influence on local wind dynamics. Wind speeds remained light overall, with a brief increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, potentially indicating changing circulation patterns. Collectively, these trends suggest the onset of a warmer, drier afternoon with possible implications for increased heat stress and potential for isolated thunderstorm development later in the day.
