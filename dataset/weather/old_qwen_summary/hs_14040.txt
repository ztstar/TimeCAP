Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, suggesting a developing heat buildup likely linked to solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with high values in the early morning and late night, indicating periods of moisture saturation, while a sharp drop in the late afternoon coincided with warming trends. Air pressure showed a marked decrease during the early morning hours, followed by a strong spike in the mid-afternoon, which may signal the passage of a weather system or front. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the south-southeast, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system or local convective activity. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward more unstable conditions, increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
