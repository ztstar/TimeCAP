Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the late night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaking in the late morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, indicating a possible clearing or drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight increase in the mid-morning hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, which may signal a change in air mass. These patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime period to a drier, slightly warmer afternoon, potentially indicating the end of a brief period of moist air advection and the approach of more stable conditions.
