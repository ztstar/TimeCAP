Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern typical of seasonal transitions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting a stabilization and drying trend as temperatures increased. Air pressure exhibited minor fluctuations but consistently remained low, with a notable drop during the early morning and late evening, which may signal the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with gusts increasing in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a frontal system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, later in the day.
