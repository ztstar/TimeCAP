Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from stable nighttime conditions to a more humid and active daytime atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be conducive to developing thunderstorms. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast, consistent with a developing synoptic-scale disturbance. The combination of rising humidity, weakening pressure, and increasing wind suggests an elevated risk of scattered thunderstorms, particularly during the evening hours.
