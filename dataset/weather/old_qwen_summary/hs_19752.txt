Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a shift in air mass. Humidity remained near saturation levels for much of the period, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting high moisture content and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased noticeably during the mid-to-late night, with stronger gusts from the southwest, implying possible convective activity or a change in local wind patterns. The consistent southerly to westerly wind directions suggest a flow that may be drawing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the persistent high humidity and increasing the likelihood of afternoon showers or thunderstorms.
