Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping steadily during the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to evaporative processes or a shallow boundary layer. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly after midday, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather pattern. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southwesterly, consistent with a developing synoptic-scale circulation. These combined indicators suggest the potential for unstable atmospheric conditions, possibly leading to scattered thunderstorms or showers in the near term.
