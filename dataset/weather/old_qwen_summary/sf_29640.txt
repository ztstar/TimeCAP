Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained low during the day, sharply increasing in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture intrusion, consistent with the region’s marine layer dynamics. Air pressure showed a pronounced drop in the early morning, followed by a recovery, reflecting the passage of a weak weather system or pressure fluctuation associated with shifting wind patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from westerly to more southerly and then easterly directions, indicating a change in local wind circulation likely tied to regional pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone marine layer to a more dynamic, ventilated atmosphere, potentially signaling clearing skies and improved visibility later in the day.
