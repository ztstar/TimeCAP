Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable daytime conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation likely tied to overnight dew point increases. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more settled weather. Wind speeds remained generally low, with minimal variability, although directional shifts indicated some atmospheric instability, particularly during the midday hours. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and consistent wind patterns suggests improving conditions toward a dry, stable air mass, reducing the likelihood of precipitation.
