Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, reaching a low before beginning a gradual recovery, indicating a cold night followed by a slow warming trend. Humidity levels remained relatively stable through the early hours, then surged significantly in the late evening, suggesting an influx of moist air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure exhibited a dramatic increase from near 975 hPa to over 1020 hPa, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low and consistent during the first half of the period, but sharply increased in the late evening before tapering off, accompanied by a noticeable shift in wind direction from southwest to more variable patterns, consistent with a changing frontal influence. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting winds points to a transition in weather patterns, likely leading to improved conditions with clearer skies and cooler, drier air in the coming hours.
