Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting a buildup of moisture likely due to marine influence. Air pressure remained stable with a slight upward trend, indicating the presence of a high-pressure system that has brought consistent, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, suggesting a change in the local flow pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity in the afternoon, and a shift in wind direction implies an approaching transition, potentially leading to clearer skies and a return to more typical coastal conditions.
