Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a persistent cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the period, indicating prolonged fog or low cloud cover, characteristic of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with only minor fluctuations, though a brief intensification was observed during late evening hours. The consistent wind direction from the northeast to east suggests the influence of marine air flow, reinforcing coastal fog development and maintaining cool, damp conditions.
