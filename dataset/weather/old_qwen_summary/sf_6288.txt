Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the day, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, clearer air. Air pressure showed a marked drop in the pre-dawn hours, followed by a sustained high-pressure regime that likely contributed to the stabilization and clearing of conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, increasing slightly in the afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from westerly to southerly directions, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a fog-prone, marine-influenced night to a warmer, drier, and more stable afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
