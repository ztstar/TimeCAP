Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, peaking before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or mist conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Collectively, these patterns point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely resulting in improved visibility and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
