Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low overnight but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable surge toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in airflow. These combined trends point to a transition from cooler, humid conditions to warmer, drier air, likely leading to improved visibility and stable, fair weather in the near term.
