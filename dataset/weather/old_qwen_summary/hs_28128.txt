Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase and subsequent daytime warming. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the overnight period, peaking during the early morning, which suggests the presence of overnight moisture accumulation, likely due to a passing front or increased atmospheric stability. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to northeast, indicating a change in air mass and possible frontal influence. These combined patterns suggest a dynamic transition in Houston’s weather, with the potential for clearing skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
