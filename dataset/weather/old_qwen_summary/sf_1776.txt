Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is common in the region during this time of year. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede changing weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a typical coastal marine layer influence, with potential for fog dissipation during the day and a return to more stable, mild conditions.
