Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before beginning a gradual rise in the late morning. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of low clouds or fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather system movement across the region. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the period, with winds shifting direction across a broad range, particularly in the afternoon and evening, hinting at localized or changing thermal influences. These conditions point to a stable, damp, and cool environment typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, especially during transitional periods between coastal fog and sunnier inland conditions.
