Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content during the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation and the presence of marine layer conditions. Air pressure showed consistent variability, with several small peaks and troughs, reflecting dynamic atmospheric adjustments typical of coastal weather patterns. Wind speed remained generally low, with brief spikes during mid-morning and late evening, coinciding with shifts in wind direction that point to localized sea breeze and drainage flow interactions. The combination of high humidity, temperature inversions, and variable wind patterns confirms the persistence of a coastal fog regime, likely contributing to reduced visibility and cooler daytime temperatures.
