Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before steadily declining into the night, indicating a strong overnight radiative cooling effect. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching near saturation during the early morning hours and remaining very high in the mid to late night, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were predominantly low, with brief spikes in the early morning and late evening, often paired with shifting wind directions—particularly from the southwest and west—indicative of marine layer dynamics. The combination of cool temperatures, high humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely resulting in foggy and damp conditions, especially in the early morning hours.
