Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or light precipitation. A notable drop in air pressure during the early hours coincided with a rise in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. The wind direction exhibited a shift from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, aligning with dynamic atmospheric changes that often precede storm development. These combined factors point to a period of unstable weather, potentially bringing showers or thunderstorms later in the day, with implications for travel and outdoor activities.
