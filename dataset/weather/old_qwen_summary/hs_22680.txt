Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a saturated atmosphere conducive to fog or drizzle. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, particularly in the last 12 hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily from early morning through the day, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast toward the east-southeast, hinting at a developing onshore flow. These combined indicators suggest a high likelihood of humid, overcast conditions with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
