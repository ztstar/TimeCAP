Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily increased, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels began high and showed a pronounced decline during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the latter half of the period, pointing to improving and more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass movement. These combined patterns suggest the approach of a drier, cooler air mass, likely associated with a developing high-pressure system, which may bring clearer skies and more stable weather conditions in the coming hours.
