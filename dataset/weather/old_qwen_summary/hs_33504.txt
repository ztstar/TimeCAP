Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and increased dampness. Air pressure showed a gradual rise through the day, culminating in a peak before a slight drop toward the end, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system with potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a strong gust toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, signaling a change in air mass. These conditions collectively suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, which may lead to improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
