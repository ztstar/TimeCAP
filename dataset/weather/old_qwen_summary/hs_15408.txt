Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a prolonged period of near-saturation humidity, indicating a high moisture content in the atmosphere that enhances the potential for precipitation. Temperature trends showed a gradual increase during the day, suggesting warming conditions, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours, which could contribute to convective activity. Air pressure steadily declined through the day, especially in the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with stronger gusts and shifting wind directions, particularly from the southeast and south, which often accompany storm development in this region. These combined conditions point to a high likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, warranting caution for residents.
