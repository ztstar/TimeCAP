Humidity levels rose significantly in the evening and remained elevated, suggesting moisture accumulation that could lead to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decrease, with a notable drop toward the end of the period, signaling the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, which may indicate a change in airflow patterns. Combined, these conditions suggest a developing weather shift, possibly bringing unsettled or stormy conditions to the region.
