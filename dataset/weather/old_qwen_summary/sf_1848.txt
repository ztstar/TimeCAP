Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and elevated temperatures. Humidity levels remained high overnight and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the early hours, followed by a rise and subsequent fluctuation, which may reflect the passage of a weak weather system or local atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased steadily through the afternoon, peaking in the late evening, driven by a persistent southerly to westerly flow that likely contributed to the dispersion of fog and mixing of air masses. The wind direction transitioned from southeasterly to more westerly and eventually northwesterly, aligning with typical coastal dynamics and indicating a possible shift in marine layer behavior that could influence coastal conditions in the coming hours.
