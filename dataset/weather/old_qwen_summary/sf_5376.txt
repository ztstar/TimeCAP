Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Air pressure showed a significant rise in the late evening, peaking around midday, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind activity was minimal during early morning hours but increased significantly in the afternoon, with gusts from the northwest and west, implying the potential for offshore flow and enhanced ventilation. These combined patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable coastal environment toward a drier, more variable regime, which could influence visibility, fog persistence, and overall comfort levels.
