Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the overnight period, then plummeted dramatically in the mid-morning, indicating a significant drying phase likely due to a shift in air mass or wind patterns. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, stabilizing afterward, which may suggest the passage of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, moist, and stable environment to a drier, more dynamic regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and stronger onshore winds later in the day.
