Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of daytime heating and drying. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-range before a slight drop toward the end of the period, which may indicate the approach of a weak frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly, reflecting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a stable, humid overnight environment to a drier, warmer daytime regime, with potential for isolated convective activity later in the period due to residual instability.
