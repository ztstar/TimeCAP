Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and morning periods, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong but diminished overnight, with a shift in wind direction suggesting changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to coastal influences or thermal gradients. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and weak winds during the early morning hours points to a high likelihood of fog, particularly near the coastline, which may persist into the early afternoon.
