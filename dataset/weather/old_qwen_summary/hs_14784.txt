Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking near saturation before sharply decreasing in the late afternoon, indicating a transition to drier conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and subsequent influence from a developing low-pressure area. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight hours, with sustained moderate to strong winds from the south-southwest, aligning with a shift toward more unstable air masses. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and a change in wind direction points to the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day, though residual moisture may support isolated afternoon showers.
