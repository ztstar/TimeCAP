Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady increase, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity levels decreased significantly throughout the day, especially in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting drier air was advecting into the region. Air pressure steadily declined during the early part of the period before stabilizing and gradually rising, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system followed by the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with a developing frontal system or increasing synoptic-scale forcing. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to southwesterly suggests a change in dominant airflow, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns with implications for precipitation and temperature trends in the coming hours.
