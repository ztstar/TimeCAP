Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually warming slightly toward the end of the period. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover, a common occurrence in the region during this time of year. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring continued damp conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout, with winds shifting from a southwest to a more westerly and then a northwest direction, indicating changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching weather system. Taken together, these conditions point to a persistent marine influence and the potential for continued overcast skies and light drizzle in the near term.
