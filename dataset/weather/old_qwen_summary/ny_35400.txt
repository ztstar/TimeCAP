Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler to warmer conditions. Humidity remained near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely persisted into the early hours before gradually declining as temperatures climbed. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, culminating in a notable drop in the late afternoon, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system and potential storm development. Wind speed remained relatively constant, but wind direction shifted from south-southeast to southwest, aligning with the movement of the approaching weather system. These patterns collectively suggest an active weather shift, increasing the likelihood of precipitation and unstable conditions in the near term.
