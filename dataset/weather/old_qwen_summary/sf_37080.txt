Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking dramatically before declining steadily as the day progressed, indicating a period of condensation or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early hours, shifting from a westerly to a more southerly and then northerly direction, with near-zero speeds during midday, which may have contributed to fog dissipation. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a typical coastal fog event, common in San Francisco, driven by marine air intrusion and temperature inversions.
