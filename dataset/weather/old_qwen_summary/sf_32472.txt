Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating elevated moisture content likely contributing to fog formation, which then gradually declined as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase overnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that has helped maintain clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief bursts during the afternoon and early evening, and wind directions shifted across multiple quadrants, reflecting changing local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal climate pattern, with nocturnal cooling and morning fog giving way to lighter, more variable winds and improving daytime visibility.
