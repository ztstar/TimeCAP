Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced stable and unchanging atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent temperature suggests a lack of significant heat sources or cold air intrusions, indicating a steady air mass over the region. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, which may increase fire risk and contribute to discomfort, particularly during outdoor activities. The persistent moderate wind from a southeasterly direction may influence coastal fog patterns, though the absence of temperature inversions or marine layer dynamics suggests limited fog development. Overall, the weather remains dry, stable, and mild, with minimal potential for abrupt changes or adverse conditions.
