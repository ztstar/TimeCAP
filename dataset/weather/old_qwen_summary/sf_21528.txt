Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels reached near-saturation during the early hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting a possible shift in weather patterns, though no major storm system was evident. Wind speeds were generally low, with a consistent easterly to northerly flow, reinforcing the presence of marine influence typical of the region's coastal climate. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and weak winds points to a prolonged period of fog or mist, particularly during the overnight hours, which may affect visibility and comfort for residents and travelers.
