Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler overnight conditions to a milder day. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, suggesting increased moisture content during the cooler periods, which may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, particularly during midday, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout much of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass movement. These combined factors point to a stabilization of weather conditions, likely leading to improved visibility and a dry, relatively calm day ahead.
