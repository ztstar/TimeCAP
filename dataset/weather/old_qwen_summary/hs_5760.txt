Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of dew formation or light precipitation, potentially contributing to a damp and muggy feel. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by slight fluctuations, signaling possible atmospheric instability that could precede thunderstorm development. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction, particularly from the southeast to the south and southwest, which may indicate the influence of a developing low-pressure system or a sea breeze front. These combined factors—high humidity, weakening pressure, and strong, shifting winds—suggest an elevated risk of isolated thunderstorms, especially during the evening and overnight hours.
