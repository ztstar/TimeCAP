Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a shift from cooler nocturnal conditions to more stable daytime temperatures. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, reaching saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog or mist that diminished later as air warmed and moisture content decreased. Air pressure showed a steady rise, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds spiked in the early morning hours before calming significantly, with a sudden shift in wind direction indicating a change in air mass flow, possibly associated with a frontal boundary. Overall, the data reflects a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, with implications for comfort levels and potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
