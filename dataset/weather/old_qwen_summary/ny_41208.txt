Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drying conditions. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the afternoon, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, indicating changing atmospheric flow. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass behind a passing front, leading to improved conditions with reduced fog and clearer visibility in the coming hours.
