Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating saturated conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. A notable pressure increase occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could affect overnight moisture levels. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests a transition toward drier and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
