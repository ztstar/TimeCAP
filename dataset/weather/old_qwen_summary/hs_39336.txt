Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually decreasing through the night before beginning to rise again in the early morning. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the late morning, indicating a possible transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier one. Air pressure exhibited a notable decline during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts originating from the southeast before shifting to more variable directions, hinting at changing air flow patterns. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind, and variable wind direction suggests a dynamic atmospheric environment, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front that could bring precipitation or storms later in the day.
