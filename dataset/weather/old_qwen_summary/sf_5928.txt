Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal climate patterns. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, which suggests increased moisture availability, likely due to marine layer formation. A notable increase in air pressure during the late morning and afternoon signals the arrival of a high-pressure system, contributing to stabilizing conditions and improving visibility. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief spike in the mid-morning, while wind directions shifted erratically, reflecting dynamic air flow near the coast and potential synoptic influences. These combined patterns point to a transitioning weather regime, with the potential for clear skies and mild conditions in the coming hours, consistent with a typical San Francisco afternoon after a foggy morning.
