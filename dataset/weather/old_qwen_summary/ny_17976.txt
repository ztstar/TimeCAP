Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady rise, beginning in the early morning hours and peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping slightly in the midday before rising again in the evening, indicating a moist air mass persisting. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a low point in the late afternoon, which suggests the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with increased chances of precipitation later in the day.
