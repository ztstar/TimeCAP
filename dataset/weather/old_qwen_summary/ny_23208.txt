Temperature showed a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend overnight and warming during the day. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the morning before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to cooler air holding less capacity. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period, then declined sharply in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest, consistent with the arrival of a low-pressure system. These combined trends point to a transition in New York City’s weather, potentially leading to unsettled conditions with possible precipitation later in the day.
