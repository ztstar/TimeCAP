Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily as temperatures increased, indicating a shift from moist, stable air to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system that may bring instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale patterns. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially setting the stage for the development of thunderstorms or showers later in the day.
