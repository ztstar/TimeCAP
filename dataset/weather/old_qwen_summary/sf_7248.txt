Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability, likely due to marine layer formation. Air pressure displayed a steady increase through the morning and early afternoon, reaching a high plateau, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the region is transitioning toward more stable, clear conditions, with a potential for fog dissipation later in the day, typical of a coastal high-pressure regime.
