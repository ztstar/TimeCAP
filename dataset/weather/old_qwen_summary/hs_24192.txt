Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking and remaining elevated through the early morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the midday hours before stabilizing, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, which may signal the approach of a boundary or changing synoptic conditions. Together, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and stable nighttime regime to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic afternoon, potentially increasing the risk of localized convective activity later in the evening.
