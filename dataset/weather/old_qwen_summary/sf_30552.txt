Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the mid-morning, reaching a minimum before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a transition from marine layer dominance to drier air intrusion. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds intensified in the mid-morning, associated with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, followed by a notable reduction in the late evening, pointing to reduced synoptic forcing. These patterns collectively suggest a clearing trend, with the city emerging from a cool, damp marine layer into a drier, more stable air mass, favoring improved visibility and sunny conditions later in the day.
