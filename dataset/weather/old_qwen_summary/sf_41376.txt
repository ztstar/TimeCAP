Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and then steadily declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels remained elevated during the night and early morning, reaching near-saturation conditions, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around midday, marked by a strong increase in wind speed and a change in direction from northerly to easterly, likely driven by a developing sea breeze or pressure gradient. Air pressure fluctuated considerably, with a sharp rise followed by a drop, indicating the passage of a dynamic weather system, possibly a cold front or low-pressure trough. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the local weather, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
