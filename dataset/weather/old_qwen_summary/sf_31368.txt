Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the early hours, indicating the dissipation of fog or low clouds, which then rose again in the late afternoon, likely due to increased moisture transport. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the early morning and a gradual decline later, suggesting a weak high-pressure system passing through. Wind speeds increased significantly during the mid-morning and again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing air mass dynamics, including a notable southerly flow. These patterns suggest the end of a marine layer event and the onset of a more variable, potentially clearer weather regime, with implications for visibility, temperature comfort, and local wind conditions.
