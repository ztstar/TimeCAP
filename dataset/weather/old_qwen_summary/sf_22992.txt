Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-constant high humidity, peaking at saturation levels during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Temperature remained consistently cool, with a gradual rise through the day, suggesting a slow warming trend as the sun emerged, though the increase was modest due to marine influence. Air pressure remained stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure system that has been suppressing significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more southerly, aligning with typical coastal flow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a classic marine layer scenario, likely resulting in foggy mornings and cool, damp conditions, with limited potential for precipitation or strong weather events.
