Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly during the afternoon and early evening, indicating strong daytime heating. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, particularly during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring instability. Wind speeds increased steadily after midnight, with stronger gusts and shifting directions, including a reversal from southerly to northerly flow, which often precedes storm development. These combined factors—rising temperatures, high moisture, falling pressure, and increasing wind—point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity in the near term.
