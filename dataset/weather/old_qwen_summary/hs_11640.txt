Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before showing a slight decline, indicating possible moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which suggests the passage of a low-pressure system through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with inflow associated with a developing or approaching weather disturbance. These conditions—cooling temperatures, rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing winds—point to an environment conducive to the development of thunderstorms, particularly during the evening hours.
