Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the late afternoon, indicating a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier air. A marked drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and a decrease in wind speed, suggesting the possible influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased again in the final hours, particularly from the west and southwest, which may indicate the arrival of a new air mass or the onset of offshore flow. These changes collectively suggest a dynamic shift in atmospheric conditions, potentially signaling the approach of a weather front that could bring changing conditions, including possible fog or rain, in the coming hours.
