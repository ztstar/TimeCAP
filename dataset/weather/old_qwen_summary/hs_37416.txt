Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the early morning hours, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air masses that may have contributed to increased cloud cover or fog. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in direction from northerly to southeasterly in the afternoon, consistent with a developing onshore flow that often precedes precipitation. These combined patterns point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day.
