Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual decline, which may indicate the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger, more consistent southerly to southwesterly winds developing, potentially signaling the onset of a change in air mass. Combined with the rising humidity and shifting wind patterns, these trends suggest a developing instability that could lead to thunderstorm development later in the day.
