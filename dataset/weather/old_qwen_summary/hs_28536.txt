Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely due to nocturnal cooling and dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to northeast, which may signal the approach of a changing air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more unstable conditions, potentially conducive to afternoon thunderstorms.
