Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels declined sharply after midnight, reaching their lowest point during the midday hours, indicating a drying trend likely driven by increasing solar heating and wind activity. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated but generally increased during the afternoon, with consistent easterly to northerly flow suggesting a shift in regional air circulation, possibly linked to a developing ridge. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and increasing comfort levels during the day.
