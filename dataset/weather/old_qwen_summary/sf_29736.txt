Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged significantly during the nighttime hours, reaching near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility in low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a passing weather system, potentially linked to a low-pressure trough affecting the region. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing synoptic patterns and possible onshore flow dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and weak winds points to a high likelihood of fog and overcast conditions persisting into the early morning hours.
