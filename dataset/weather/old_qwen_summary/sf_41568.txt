Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained high values during the overnight hours and a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or the onset of drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though a brief dip and subsequent rise may signal localized atmospheric adjustments. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with a peak in the final hour, driven by a shift to southerly and westerly wind directions, potentially enhancing coastal fog dissipation. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stronger winds late in the cycle suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions in the coming hours.
