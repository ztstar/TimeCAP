Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to New York City. Temperature trends show a gradual warming from early morning through the day, reflecting a transition toward milder conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly in the afternoon and evening, peaking during the night, which increases the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the evening and overnight hours, with gusts reaching higher levels, suggesting stronger atmospheric instability. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly sectors indicates a changing air mass, potentially signaling the onset of cooler, more turbulent weather.
