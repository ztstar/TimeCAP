Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning and late evening, suggesting increased fog potential, particularly overnight, which is common in the region due to marine layer formation. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking before a gradual decline, signaling a transition from stable to slightly more active atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and westerly sectors, implying the influence of shifting sea breeze patterns and possible onshore flow. These combined factors suggest a likely continuation of cool, foggy mornings with clearing skies and mild temperatures in the afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
