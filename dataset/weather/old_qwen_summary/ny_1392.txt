Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting high and dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air, likely due to a change in wind patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the end, reinforcing the presence of a strengthening high-pressure dome that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds showed variability, with a notable peak in the evening followed by a lull, while wind directions shifted from northeasterly to more westerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends suggest the onset of a drier, more stable weather regime, potentially leading to improved visibility and mild conditions in the coming hours.
