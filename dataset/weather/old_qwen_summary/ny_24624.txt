Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a transitional season. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely contributing to reduced visibility and a cool, damp feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the late morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach or influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and south, suggesting a shift in airflow that could bring milder air or the potential for developing weather systems. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increased wind from the southeast hints at a possible transition toward warmer, more humid conditions, with a slight risk of isolated showers later in the day.
