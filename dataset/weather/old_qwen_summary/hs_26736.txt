Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and atmospheric stability. Humidity levels peaked at saturation in the early morning, creating thick fog and reducing visibility, before declining sharply during midday, suggesting a drier air mass moving in. Air pressure exhibited a significant spike in the late night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a developing low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more northerly and easterly directions, with increased speeds in the late evening—indicative of changing synoptic-scale flow and potential storm development. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period marked by high moisture, warming temperatures, and dynamic wind shifts, increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
