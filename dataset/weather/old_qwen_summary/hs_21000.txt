Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a consistent drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of a stable, moist air mass that may have contributed to fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure steadily declined, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather, including precipitation, in the coming hours. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the latter part of the period, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, which may indicate a change in the atmospheric circulation pattern. These combined trends point to a developing weather system that could lead to increasing cloud cover and potential rainfall in the near term.
