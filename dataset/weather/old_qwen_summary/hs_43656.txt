Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture layer that dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and morning, then gradually decreased in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were light and variable overnight, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction that may reflect changing synoptic influences. These combined trends point to a transition period, with the potential for developing convection or thunderstorms later in the evening due to warming temperatures and moisture convergence.
