Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the midday, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by clearing skies. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds were strongest in the early evening and decreased significantly overnight, with wind direction shifting from predominantly westerly to more variable, including southerly and easterly components in the late night and early morning. These patterns point to a transition from marine influence to inland dynamics, likely reflecting the end of a coastal fog event and the onset of a drier, more stable regime.
