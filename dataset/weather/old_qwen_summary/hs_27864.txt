Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion that broke mid-morning. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and increased moisture, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system or a developing frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained generally light throughout the period, with a brief increase during the late night, likely associated with local convective activity or a minor pressure gradient. The overall pattern points to a transition phase in Houston’s weather, with increasing instability and potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
