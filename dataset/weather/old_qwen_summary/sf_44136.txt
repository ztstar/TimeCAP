Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, with a significant increase during the overnight hours and early morning, suggesting the presence of marine layer development, which later broke down as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and improved visibility. Wind patterns revealed a shift from southerly to easterly and then to more variable directions, with stronger winds in the late afternoon, possibly driven by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. These observations collectively point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, warmer weather, consistent with a typical San Francisco afternoon pattern.
