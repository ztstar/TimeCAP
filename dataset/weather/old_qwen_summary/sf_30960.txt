Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the early morning hours, peaking during the night, which suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with a sharp rise late in the period, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably in the early morning, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, with strong gusts from the west and south, likely driven by coastal upwelling and pressure gradients. These combined factors point to a transitional weather phase marked by cooling, high moisture, and variable winds, potentially leading to foggy mornings and a gradual clearing as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
