Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period into a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night, then sharply decreased in the morning, suggesting the dissipation of fog or drizzle as the air warmed. A significant drop in air pressure early in the morning, followed by a period of stabilization, points to the passage of a low-pressure system that brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the mid-to-late morning, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with frontal passage and atmospheric instability. The combination of rising temperature, falling humidity, and sustained wind suggests improving conditions, with drier and breezier weather expected in the coming hours.
