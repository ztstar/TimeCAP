Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed a sharp increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development later in the day. Wind speeds diminished markedly after midnight, with calm conditions prevailing through the early morning, followed by a gradual resurgence in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and east. The shift in wind direction from west to south and then to the east suggests a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to the movement of a coastal trough or a warming trend inland, which may influence coastal fog patterns in the coming hours.
