Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from a colder nocturnal phase to a milder daytime period. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could support cloud formation or precipitation. A notable drop in air pressure during the early morning hours coincided with increased humidity and wind activity, signaling the possible passage of a low-pressure system or front. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the night and early morning, decreasing to near calm conditions in the late morning, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing or passing weather system. These combined factors suggest the potential for unsettled weather, including possible thunderstorms or drizzle, particularly as the atmosphere remains saturated and pressure stabilizes.
