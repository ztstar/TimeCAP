Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the day, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, particularly during the night and early morning. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely suppressed storm development and promoted stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, suggesting a change in local circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition period, with the potential for developing convective activity later in the day due to increasing instability and moisture.
