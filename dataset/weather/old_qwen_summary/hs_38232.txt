Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating the onset of a daytime heating cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning and remained near saturation, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could support cloud development or precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south, indicating a change in airflow likely associated with the developing system. These combined factors suggest a heightened potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the coming hours, particularly during the overnight period.
