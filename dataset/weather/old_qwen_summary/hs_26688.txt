Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the overnight hours, followed by a steady and significant warming trend through the afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning hours before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal boundary layer that trapped moisture before dissipating with warming. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-to-late morning, followed by a sustained drop in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a shift toward more variable and slightly stronger winds in the late evening, accompanied by a change in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially indicating inflow associated with a developing weather system. Collectively, these trends suggest that Houston transitioned from a stable, moist nocturnal environment to a warmer, drier, and increasingly dynamic atmospheric regime, with conditions favorable for possible afternoon thunderstorms or convective activity later in the day.
