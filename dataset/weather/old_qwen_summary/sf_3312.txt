Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of nighttime condensation and fog formation. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, particularly in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind activity remained minimal initially, but increased in intensity and changed direction during the late night and early morning, likely due to local coastal dynamics or synoptic-scale influences. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a high likelihood of fog or overcast conditions persisting into the coming hours, especially near the coast.
