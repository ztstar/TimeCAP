Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal activity and generally fair conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late morning and afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and southerly sectors, hinting at a change in air mass. These combined patterns suggest a transition from cooler, moist conditions to a slightly warmer, drier, and breezier environment, with potential for improved visibility and a mild end to the day.
