Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative cooling and changing air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, peaking in the overnight hours and dropping sharply during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system developing, which typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest, signaling the arrival of a cold front. These combined indicators point to a period of cooling, drying, and improving weather conditions, likely resulting in crisp, clear skies in the coming hours.
