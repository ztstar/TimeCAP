Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and created a damp, cool sensation. A significant shift in wind direction occurred around midnight, transitioning from westerly to southeasterly, coinciding with a temporary rise in wind speed and a sharp decline in humidity, suggesting the dissipation of marine layer influence. Air pressure showed brief fluctuations, with a temporary increase late in the evening followed by a slight decrease, hinting at the passage of a weak weather system. Overall, the data suggests a dynamic coastal transition, with marine layer conditions giving way to clearer skies and more stable conditions by late afternoon.
