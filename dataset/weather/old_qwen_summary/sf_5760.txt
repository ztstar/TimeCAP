Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s maritime climate. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of near-saturation, particularly during the early morning and late night, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor variations, pointing to a persistent high-pressure system influencing the area and contributing to stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west and southwest, likely driven by coastal upwelling and sea-breeze dynamics. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore patterns later in the day may have facilitated moisture influx, potentially supporting continued fog formation or overcast conditions into the night.
