Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late evening and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, indicating an approaching low-pressure system that could bring ongoing precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning, with strong, consistent winds from the southwesterly to westerly quadrant, suggesting the influence of a coastal wind surge or frontal passage. These combined factors point to a dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime, with a high likelihood of continued overcast conditions and possible drizzle or light rain in the near term.
