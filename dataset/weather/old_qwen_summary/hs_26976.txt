Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend likely associated with a passing weather system. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which contributed to a persistent muggy feel and increased discomfort. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, including a sharp rise followed by a deep low, suggesting the influence of a dynamic frontal boundary or storm system moving through the region. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from easterly to southerly and then to more variable directions, which may have facilitated the transport of moist air and increased storm potential. These combined indicators point to a period of unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of localized showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
