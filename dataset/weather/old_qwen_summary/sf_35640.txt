Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a brief drop in the early morning, followed by a notable rise later in the day, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the arrival of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds decreased overnight and remained light through the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These patterns suggest the dissipation of coastal fog and the onset of a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improved visibility and milder daytime conditions.
