Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained high values in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of marine layer influence, while lower values during midday point to drying under increasing solar heating. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which typically signals improving weather and clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally low, with near-zero values during morning and midday hours, followed by a resurgence in the evening, accompanied by variable wind directions—indicative of shifting local circulation patterns, possibly due to coastal dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cool, moist marine environment toward a drier, warmer afternoon, likely resulting in clearer skies and reduced fog by late evening.
