Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation, which aligns with the city’s typical coastal climate patterns. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather to the region. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a notable increase only in the final hours, while wind direction shifted from westerly to more southerly, possibly signaling a change in air mass. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a cool, fog-prone night to a more stable and slightly warmer day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
