Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable marine layer to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained elevated overnight, particularly in the pre-dawn hours, before decreasing significantly as the day progressed—suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight rise in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the morning and midday, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to easterly and then to northerly, reflecting dynamic atmospheric circulation changes that influence coastal fog patterns. These combined factors suggest a typical San Francisco weather cycle—cool, foggy mornings giving way to clearer, warmer afternoons—though the persistent wind shifts may contribute to localized variability in temperature and visibility.
