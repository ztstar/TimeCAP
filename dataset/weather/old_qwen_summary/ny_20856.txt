Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the overnight hours, reaching a low before rising sharply in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture influx. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning, with a notable low recorded in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, but shifts in wind direction—from southerly to westerly and then to northeasterly—signal a changing air mass and potential storm development. The combination of falling pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting winds points to an active weather pattern, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
