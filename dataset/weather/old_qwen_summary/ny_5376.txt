Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before stabilizing in the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose gradually during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly, suggesting increasing moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a sustained high-pressure regime, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and morning, with a notable drop in the mid-morning hours followed by a resurgence in the afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising humidity, stable high pressure, and variable wind patterns indicates the potential for developing fog or low clouds in the morning hours, with improving conditions later in the day.
