Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation and subsequent clearing. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low throughout, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to south-southeast in the late morning, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These indicators collectively point to a transition from a cold, moist air mass to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to clearer skies and colder conditions in the coming hours.
