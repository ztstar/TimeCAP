Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking and remaining high, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is characteristic of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric stability, possibly linked to an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable calm during the early morning hours, followed by a brief increase later in the day, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more easterly and northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a coastal fog event that formed overnight, likely driven by marine layer dynamics, which may persist into the coming hours and impact visibility and perceived temperature.
