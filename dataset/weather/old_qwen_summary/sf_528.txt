Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual回暖 in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, particularly near coastal areas. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period during the early morning hours, followed by a resurgence in the late afternoon, primarily from the south and southeast. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly suggests a change in airflow patterns, possibly signaling a transition in local weather dynamics that could influence coastal fog and temperature stability.
