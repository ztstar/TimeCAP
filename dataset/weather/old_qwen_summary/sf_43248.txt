Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching a low before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest and west during the night to more variable and easterly directions by midday, potentially signaling a change in local circulation. The prolonged period of high humidity and cool temperatures, combined with low wind speeds in the early hours, likely contributed to widespread fog, a hallmark of San Francisco’s microclimate.
