- Number of specimens tested: The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with consistent growth in the number of specimens tested, indicating increasing respiratory surveillance activity or heightened influenza circulation. A notable acceleration in the rate of increase is observed in the final five weeks, suggesting a recent surge that may reflect a peak in influenza activity. This trend underscores the need for heightened monitoring, potential strain on diagnostic capacity, and readiness for public health interventions.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator shows a sustained and accelerating increase in positive influenza A specimens, with a sharp upturn beginning in week 12, indicative of a growing epidemic surge. The trajectory suggests a rapid escalation in transmission, likely entering a peak phase, with recent values far exceeding earlier baseline levels. This pattern signals a significant public health concern requiring heightened surveillance, resource allocation, and potential intervention to mitigate widespread impact.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the final five weeks, signaling a sharp increase in influenza B activity. The data reveals a significant jump in cases during the most recent period, indicating the potential onset or peak of an influenza B outbreak. This rapid escalation suggests heightened transmission and may necessitate urgent public health interventions to mitigate spread and support healthcare system preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the final five weeks, indicating a rapid increase in influenza positivity rates. The data reveals a significant inflection point around week 15, followed by a steep climb that suggests the emergence of a strong seasonal influenza wave. This pattern implies heightened community transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources, warranting urgent public health monitoring and preparedness.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator shows a steady increase in influenza A positivity, with a notable acceleration in the most recent weeks, suggesting the emergence of a significant respiratory influenza surge. The sharp rise from moderate levels to substantially elevated values indicates a transition from baseline circulation to a period of heightened transmission, potentially signaling the peak of an influenza season. This trend underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, public health preparedness, and targeted interventions to mitigate potential strain on healthcare systems.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator shows a sustained upward trajectory over the past 20 weeks, with a marked acceleration in the latter half, indicating a significant and rapid increase in influenza B positivity. The most recent values represent a sharp departure from earlier levels, suggesting the onset of a strong seasonal or outbreak phase. This trend signals heightened transmission activity and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance, public health preparedness, and potential intervention measures.
