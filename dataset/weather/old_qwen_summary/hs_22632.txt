Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting a period of moisture accumulation likely due to nocturnal condensation and stable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a persistent high-pressure influence that has suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, hinting at a change in air mass or the approach of a weak frontal boundary. These conditions point to a transition period with increasing surface instability, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift are maintained.
