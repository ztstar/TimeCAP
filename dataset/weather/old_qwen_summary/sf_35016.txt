Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of low-level clouds and fog as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level before a slight drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening frontal influence. Wind speeds remained low overnight with brief spikes during midday and late evening, with wind directions shifting from southwesterly to northerly, consistent with a transition from onshore to offshore flow. These patterns point to the clearing of marine fog and improving visibility, likely leading to sunny conditions in the coming hours, though coastal areas may still experience pockets of lingering mist.
