Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and easterly, signaling a change in air mass that may bring cooler, drier air. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, potentially reducing the chance of afternoon thunderstorms.
