Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend overnight and a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels surged to near or at saturation during the early morning and late night, particularly around dawn, suggesting conditions favorable for fog or mist formation. Air pressure rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning, then stabilized and slightly declined, reflecting a high-pressure system passing overhead, which generally brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, indicating a change in airflow possibly associated with a frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and calm period toward a drier, slightly warmer, and more dynamic atmosphere, potentially signaling the approach of a weather change.
