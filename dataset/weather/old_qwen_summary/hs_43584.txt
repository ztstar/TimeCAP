Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise in temperature through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked sharply overnight, indicating possible precipitation or fog development, before dropping significantly as temperatures climbed, suggesting a drying trend in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, peaking in the midday hours before stabilizing and slightly declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction from northerly to easterly and back, hinting at changing air mass influences. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a stable, moist air mass to a drier, warmer regime, potentially clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
