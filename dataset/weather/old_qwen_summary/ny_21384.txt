Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting saturated air conditions that may contribute to fog or mist, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure exhibited a continuous upward trend, signaling the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds increased slightly during the early morning hours and remained elevated before subsiding in the late afternoon, with winds predominantly coming from the northwest to west, consistent with a strengthening high-pressure influence. Overall, the combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, rising pressure, and moderate northerly winds points to a transition toward drier, clearer, and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
