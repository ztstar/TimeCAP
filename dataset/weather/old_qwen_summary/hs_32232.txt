Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained elevated during the early morning and overnight, dropping significantly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no clear indication of an approaching weather system, though a slight decline in the morning may hint at changing atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northerly to easterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, drier day, with minimal risk of precipitation but possible discomfort due to rising temperatures and decreasing humidity.
