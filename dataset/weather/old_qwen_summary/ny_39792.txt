Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, reaching a peak in the late night and early morning, then sharply dropping during the midday, indicating a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to high in the early morning and late evening, with directional shifts from the southwest to northwest, reflecting dynamic airflow patterns associated with changing pressure gradients. The combination of dropping humidity, rising pressure, and decreasing wind suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air in the coming hours.
