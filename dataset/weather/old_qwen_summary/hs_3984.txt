Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking near saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the development of fog or mist, particularly during the period of lowest temperatures. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a recovery later in the day, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought transient showers or thunderstorms. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southerly to southwesterly winds dominating, indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation possibly linked to an approaching frontal boundary. These conditions collectively suggest a dynamic weather pattern, with potential for unsettled conditions, including isolated storms, in the near term.
