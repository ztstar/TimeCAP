Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity remained near saturation through the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which suggests the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, particularly in the later half of the period, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, with a predominant westerly to southwesterly direction, consistent with onshore flow often associated with coastal upwelling and fog advection. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, cool overnight conditions to a drier, windier, and more stable afternoon and evening, typical of a San Francisco summer weather pattern.
