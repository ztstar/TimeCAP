Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from night-time radiative loss to daytime solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation for much of the night and early morning, which suggests the presence of stable air and potential for fog or low cloud cover. A significant pressure rise in the late afternoon, peaking in the evening, indicates the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early hours to a more consistent direction from the west-southwest in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a sea breeze. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and a shift in wind direction suggests a transition toward more stable and settled weather, although residual moisture may still support isolated showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
