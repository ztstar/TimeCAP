Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a cooling phase overnight, indicating a dynamic diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a minor drop in the evening—consistent with a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from southerly to westerly over the night, indicating a change in airflow patterns possibly linked to a passing weather front. Together, these conditions point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing moisture and shifting winds potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions later in the day.
