Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during the night, with a brief spike in the afternoon, indicating drying air after an initial period of moisture. Air pressure rose steadily during the early morning, peaking in the midday, which is consistent with the influence of a high-pressure system bringing stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling changing airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cooler, drier, and stable environment to one with stronger winds and potential for more dynamic weather later in the day.
