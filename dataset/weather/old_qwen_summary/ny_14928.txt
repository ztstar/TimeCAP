Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend through the early morning, reaching a high before gradually declining, reflecting the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southeast, hinting at a changing airflow pattern. These trends collectively suggest a transition from stable, humid conditions to a more dynamic atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for shifting weather patterns, including possible precipitation later in the day.
