Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation and potential for fog or mist formation during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure remained largely stable with minor fluctuations, showing no indication of a strong weather system passing through, which implies relatively calm conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent throughout, with a shift in direction from southwesterly to more southerly during the early morning, likely influenced by local thermal patterns. These conditions together suggest a stable atmosphere with a slight risk of overnight fog and no immediate threat of storms or extreme weather.
