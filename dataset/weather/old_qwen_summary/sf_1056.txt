Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the midday, indicating a transition from stable nighttime conditions to a drier, more variable daytime atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight downward trend in the final hours, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind activity intensified during the early morning and late afternoon, with shifting directions indicating dynamic air mass movements, particularly from the southwest and southeast. These combined factors suggest a developing coastal influence, with possible fog formation overnight and a likelihood of clearing skies during the day as winds and pressure systems shift.
