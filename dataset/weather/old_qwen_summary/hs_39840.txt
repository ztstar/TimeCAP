Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before midday, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a gradual increase during the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon, with a significant rise in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly and then easterly, suggesting changing airflow dynamics. These conditions point to a transition phase, likely involving the approach of a drier air mass, which may reduce humidity and improve comfort levels in the coming hours.
