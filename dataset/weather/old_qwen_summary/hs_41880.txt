Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. A steady increase in air pressure through the early morning hours suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained low until late evening, when a notable increase occurred, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly flow, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with the possibility of clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day, though residual moisture may lead to brief periods of low visibility.
