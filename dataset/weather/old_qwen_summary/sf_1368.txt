Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of diurnal cycles and possibly marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which is characteristic of fog formation typical in coastal areas during summer months. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during midday, indicating the presence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing of fog and improved visibility. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the afternoon, likely driven by local topography and sea breeze effects. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the afternoon suggests a transition toward more marine-influenced air, reinforcing the likelihood of fog dissipation and warmer, drier conditions later in the day.
