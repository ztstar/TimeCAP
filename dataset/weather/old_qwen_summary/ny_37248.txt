Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady rise during the daytime, followed by a sharp drop in the early morning hours, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the day but surged overnight, particularly in the early hours, suggesting the onset of moisture accumulation, possibly linked to a cooling trend. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strong high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more westerly and northerly wind directions, likely due to the strengthening high-pressure gradient. These combined trends point to a transition toward cooler, drier, and more stable conditions, with potential for clear skies and comfortable daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
