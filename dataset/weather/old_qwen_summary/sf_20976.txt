Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a typical coastal diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels steadily increased during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of a dense fog or low cloud layer that likely formed overnight. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions to the region. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong throughout the period, with a notable shift in direction from predominantly southerly to easterly, indicating changing synoptic influences and possible onshore flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind speeds in the evening, and persistent high humidity suggests a transition toward clearer, drier conditions later in the day, which may lead to improved visibility and a gradual dissipation of fog.
