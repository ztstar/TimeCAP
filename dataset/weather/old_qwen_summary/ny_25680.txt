Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly between midnight and dawn. A steady drop in atmospheric pressure began in the early morning and continued into the afternoon, culminating in a notable low, which often precedes stormy or unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more westerly and northerly, signaling a change in air mass and the approach of a frontal system. Combined with high humidity and falling pressure, these conditions point to a high likelihood of precipitation later in the day or overnight.
