Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained low during the night and early morning, rising significantly in the late morning and peaking in the early evening, indicating a shift toward more moisture-laden air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late morning, followed by a sharp rise into the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather system, likely a front, that brought clearer skies and increased stability. Wind speeds were generally light except for a brief but strong increase in the late afternoon, coinciding with a change in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, which may have signaled the arrival of a new air mass. The overall pattern points to a transition from cooler, drier conditions to warmer, moister air, potentially setting the stage for changing weather later in the day.
