Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, then dropped sharply during the afternoon before rebounding slightly in the evening, indicating a drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the latter half of the period, suggesting improving weather conditions and the potential approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly in the last few hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable, potentially signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. Overall, the pattern suggests a transition from cooler, more humid conditions to a drier, more stable environment, likely resulting in clearer skies and milder conditions in the near term.
