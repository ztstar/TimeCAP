Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, reaching near-saturation conditions before gradually declining, indicating a possible shift in air mass or onset of clearing. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall but exhibited a brief increase during the early hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, though minor fluctuations point to localized atmospheric changes. Wind speeds were strongest in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may signal changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convection or localized thunderstorms.
