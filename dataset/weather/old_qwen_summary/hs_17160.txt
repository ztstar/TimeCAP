Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the latter half of the period, indicating a shift toward more stable and warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout, peaking during the early morning hours and sustaining near-maximum values, which enhances the perception of mugginess and can contribute to discomfort. Air pressure showed a sustained decline, particularly in the final six hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a notable increase in the final few hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. Collectively, these indicators point to an environment conducive to potential thunderstorm development, especially as warm, moist air continues to accumulate under a weakening pressure gradient.
