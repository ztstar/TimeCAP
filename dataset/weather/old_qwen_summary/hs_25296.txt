Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition toward warmer conditions. Humidity levels were consistently high through the early morning, peaking at saturation, before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies or a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the midday and evening, followed by a drop in the late night, hinting at the passage of a weather system or potential storm development. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, indicating possible storm activity or frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then to westerly-southwesterly directions supports the arrival of a dynamic air mass, which may contribute to unstable conditions and potential thunderstorms.
