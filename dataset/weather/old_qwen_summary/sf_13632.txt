Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the midday, then surging again in the late evening, indicating a possible fog or marine layer development. Air pressure remained relatively stable until late evening, when a notable drop occurred, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, gradually decreasing through the day, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to coastal dynamics. These patterns suggest a transition from a stable, foggy marine layer to a more variable and potentially unsettled weather regime, with implications for visibility, temperature swings, and possible precipitation.
