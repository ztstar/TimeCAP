Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a prolonged period of near-freezing temperatures, with a notable and sustained warming trend observed in the final several hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning and late night, indicating moist air masses that contributed to foggy or overcast conditions. A steady decline in atmospheric pressure was recorded, peaking in the middle of the period before stabilizing, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns, hinting at changing air mass influences. These combined factors point to a transition from cold, damp conditions toward a potentially unstable or storm-prone environment in the near term.
