Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, plummeting during mid-morning and early afternoon before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a period of dry air intrusion followed by moisture reintroduction. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal boundary. Wind activity was minimal during the night and early morning, but intensified in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with coastal wind patterns and potential marine layer influence. The combination of fluctuating humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind directions points to dynamic atmospheric conditions, likely driven by the interaction of marine air and inland temperature gradients, which could lead to changing weather later in the day.
