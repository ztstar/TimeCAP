Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both the number of specimens tested and the proportion of positive cases increasing significantly. The proportion of positive specimens has more than doubled in the last 8 weeks, indicating a sharp escalation in community transmission. Influenza A has consistently been the dominant subtype, with its proportion rising more rapidly than Influenza B, which has also shown marked increases, particularly in recent weeks. The most recent data reveal a notable surge in positivity rates, suggesting the onset of a strong seasonal influenza wave, likely peaking in the near term. This rapid acceleration underscores the need for heightened public health surveillance, increased clinical awareness, and proactive measures such as vaccination and infection control.
