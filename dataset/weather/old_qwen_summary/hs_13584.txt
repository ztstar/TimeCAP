Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a clear cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during early morning hours, reducing visibility. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the day, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from consistent southerly flow during the night to variable and increasing speeds in the afternoon, with gusts from the west and south, possibly signaling the influence of a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day, particularly if the low-pressure system deepens.
