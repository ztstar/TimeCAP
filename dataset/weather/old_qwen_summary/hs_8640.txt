Temperature trends show a nighttime cooling phase followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting increased moisture availability likely from overnight condensation or nocturnal air mass changes. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by stabilization at a lower level, which may signal the influence of a developing low-pressure system or approaching frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased substantially in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the east and south, consistent with a change in regional circulation likely tied to a frontal or convective process. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially increasing the risk of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
