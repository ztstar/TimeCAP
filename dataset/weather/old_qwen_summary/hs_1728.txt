Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a post-overnight dew point increase and subsequent drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure ridge that likely contributed to the clearing skies and stabilized conditions. Winds remained light to moderate, with a shift from northerly to easterly directions during the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a more dynamic air mass. The overall pattern points to a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a drier, warmer daytime regime, consistent with a high-pressure controlled, fair-weather scenario in the Houston area.
