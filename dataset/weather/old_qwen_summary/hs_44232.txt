Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping during the day, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period but declined slightly in the late evening, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, including a shift toward more easterly and northerly flows, which may signal the approach of a disturbance. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night into a warmer, breezier day, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development.
