Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, especially in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing conditions. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more westerly and then southerly direction, with increasing wind speeds toward the end of the period, potentially enhancing coastal mixing and fog dissipation. These conditions together point to a transition phase, with possible fog clearing and variable wind-driven weather patterns affecting the region in the coming hours.
