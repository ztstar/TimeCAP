Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining steadily into the afternoon, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure showed a slight decrease in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a shift in regional atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds diminished significantly after midnight, with light, variable winds prevailing during the day, which may have limited air mixing and contributed to the buildup of humidity near the surface. The shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and then northerly late in the day hints at changing synoptic influences, potentially signaling the end of a moist maritime air mass and the onset of drier, more stable conditions.
