Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, with a notable increase during the late night and early morning, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a high-pressure system over the region. Wind speeds were generally low, with a brief surge in the early morning and late evening, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest a clearing trend with improving conditions, likely leading to a dry and stable day ahead, favorable for outdoor activities.
