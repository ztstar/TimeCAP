Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning, remaining near 100% for several hours, indicating strong fog formation or persistent low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early afternoon, signaling a buildup of high-pressure influence that likely suppressed cloud development and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions near 0 m/s, but picked up in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns possibly tied to diurnal heating or coastal dynamics. The consistent southerly to southwesterly wind direction supports the presence of a marine layer, reinforcing the coastal fog and cool maritime influence typical of the region.
