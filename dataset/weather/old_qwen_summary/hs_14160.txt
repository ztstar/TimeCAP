Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early hours, reaching a peak before a sharp drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with a change in air mass and potential storm development. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and wind shifts points to an active atmospheric environment, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day.
