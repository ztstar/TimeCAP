Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the early morning. Humidity levels remained high, particularly during the overnight hours, with near-saturation conditions persisting for several hours, indicating a strong likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief but strong surge during the pre-dawn hours, followed by a return to gentle breezes, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and eventually easterly, signaling changing atmospheric flow. These conditions collectively suggest a marine layer influence with potential for foggy mornings and mild, stable weather, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate pattern.
