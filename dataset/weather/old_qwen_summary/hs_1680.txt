Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the evening, peaking during the overnight period, suggesting increased moisture availability that may have contributed to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified after midnight, particularly from the west-northwest, signaling a shift in atmospheric circulation that could be associated with a frontal passage. The combination of decreasing temperatures, rising humidity, and a strengthening high-pressure system suggests a transition toward drier, more stable weather, though residual moisture may lead to morning fog or drizzle.
