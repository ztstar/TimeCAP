Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours, which contributes to a muggy and oppressive feel despite moderate temperatures. Air pressure showed a steady decline, especially in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, with a noticeable shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow typical of humid subtropical climates. These combined factors suggest a heightened potential for thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
