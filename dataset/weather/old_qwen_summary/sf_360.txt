Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rebounding in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near dawn before a dramatic drop during midday, suggesting a shift from foggy or moist conditions to drier, clearer air. A notable pressure decrease occurred in the late evening, followed by a brief recovery, indicating the passage of a weather system that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong from the northwest, subsiding during midday before intensifying again in the evening, with wind direction shifting toward the southwest and then south, consistent with a coastal breeze pattern. These dynamics point to a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone environment to a more stable, drier regime, likely bringing improved visibility and milder conditions in the near term.
