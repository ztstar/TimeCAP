Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiation and changing air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation in the late evening and early morning, which suggests the potential for fog formation and a muggy, oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, especially in the afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight and early morning hours, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, consistent with the influx of moist air associated with developing storm systems. The shift in wind direction toward more southerly and easterly flows late at night indicates the influence of a developing frontal boundary, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms in the near term.
