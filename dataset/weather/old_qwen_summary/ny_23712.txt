Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight cool-down. Humidity levels fluctuated sharply, peaking during the early morning hours and dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the influence of a passing moisture front or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a sustained high, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, generally associated with stable, dry, and clear weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southeast and south, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or a change in wind patterns. Combined, these indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from cooler, more humid overnight conditions to drier, milder daytime weather under the influence of a stabilizing high-pressure system.
