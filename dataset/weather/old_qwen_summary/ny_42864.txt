Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and remaining low into the early morning before a gradual recovery. A significant spike in humidity, peaking at saturation levels, coincided with a brief period of light wind and a marked shift in wind direction, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass. This was followed by a strengthening wind from the southwest and a steady rise in atmospheric pressure, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. The wind direction transitioned from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, reflecting changing synoptic patterns that may have contributed to the clearing skies and improved air quality. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a damp, unstable period to a drier, more stable regime, likely leading to clearer skies and cooler temperatures in the near term.
