Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, reducing visibility and creating a muggy feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with increased cloud cover and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger, more consistent winds from the south and southeast, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could bring additional moisture. The shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest in the final hours suggests a possible change in the atmospheric pattern, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal boundary or a shift in the synoptic-scale weather regime.
