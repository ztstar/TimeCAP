Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and gradually declining through the night before showing a slight rebound in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early and late hours, spiking dramatically during the overnight period before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a maritime air mass shift. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which likely contributed to the increased cloud cover and reduced wind speeds during the early hours. Wind speeds were initially moderate and variable, but intensified in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, possibly signaling a change in synoptic conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests the onset of a moist, unstable air mass, potentially leading to foggy conditions or light precipitation in the coming hours.
