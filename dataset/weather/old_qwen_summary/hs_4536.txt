Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the formation of fog or mist during the early hours, likely contributing to reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, particularly in the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable conditions. Wind patterns showed a shift from predominantly southerly to easterly and northeasterly directions in the afternoon, with sustained elevated speeds, especially in the late evening, indicating possible storm development or frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind speeds points to a heightened risk of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
