Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning before beginning a slow decline, indicating a persistent marine influence. Air pressure showed a notable increase around midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and stabilized conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from a southwesterly to a more southerly and then easterly flow, potentially signaling a change in coastal airflow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and moderate temperature trends suggests improving weather stability, with a likely transition toward more pleasant and less fog-prone conditions.
