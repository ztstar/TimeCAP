Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining high, indicating a moist air mass influencing the region. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a notable rise in the early morning hours followed by a gradual decline, suggesting the passage of a transient weather system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more southeasterly directions, with speeds remaining moderate, potentially indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These conditions together suggest the arrival of a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms as temperatures rise and instability builds.
