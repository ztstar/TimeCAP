Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of marine layer formation, which is typical for the region during certain seasons. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, signaling a possible change in weather patterns, potentially bringing in more unstable air. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, then decreased before picking up again in the late evening, reflecting the influence of local topography and sea-breeze circulation. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition that could lead to foggy conditions or even light precipitation, particularly in low-lying coastal areas.
