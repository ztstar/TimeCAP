Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating increased moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and later to the northeast, signaling changing airflow patterns typical of coastal weather dynamics. These conditions suggest a transition toward potentially overcast or foggy conditions, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal climate, particularly during the early morning hours.
