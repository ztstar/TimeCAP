Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely influenced by increasing solar radiation and minimal cloud cover. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before sharply declining, suggesting a drying trend associated with a shift in air mass or subsidence. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely brought stable and dry conditions in the latter part of the period. Wind speeds were uniformly low and wind direction remained constant, indicating a lack of significant synoptic forcing or frontal activity, which supports the stability observed in pressure and temperature patterns. Taken together, these indicators suggest a period of fair, dry, and gradually warming weather with limited potential for precipitation or storm development.
