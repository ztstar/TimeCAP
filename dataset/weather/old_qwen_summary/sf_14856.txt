Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the middle of the night, followed by a sustained period of high pressure, suggesting the passage of a weather system that brought stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning, with a shift from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, reflecting changing flow patterns associated with the pressure changes. These dynamics point to a transition from coastal fog and cool conditions to clearer, warmer, and more stable weather in the late afternoon and evening.
