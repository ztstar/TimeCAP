Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend toward evening, indicating a marked diurnal cycle. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, signaling a potential shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase during the midday period, while wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and later to a more southeasterly flow, consistent with changing synoptic influences. These patterns together suggest the influence of a nocturnal cooling event followed by daytime heating, with possible implications for the development of localized convective activity later in the day.
