Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist marine layer to drier, more stable air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to more easterly and then southerly, which may reflect changing synoptic influences. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cool, fog-prone coastal environment to a warmer, drier regime, consistent with the typical diurnal pattern in San Francisco, with potential for improving visibility and reduced fog in the coming hours.
