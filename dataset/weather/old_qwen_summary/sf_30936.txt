Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during the midday, indicating dry air infiltration, which was later counteracted by rising moisture in the evening, especially during the overnight hours. Air pressure exhibited a fluctuating pattern with a notable low in the early morning and a peak later in the day, suggesting active atmospheric changes, possibly linked to shifting weather systems. Wind speeds increased significantly during midday and again in the evening, with gusts from the southwest and south, implying the influence of a developing onshore flow. These combined factors—cooling followed by warming, variable humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind patterns—point to dynamic coastal weather conditions that may lead to fog formation or localized showers, particularly near the waterfront.
