Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of winter conditions. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the predawn period before dropping and then rising again in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining slightly in the late afternoon, which may indicate the influence of a passing high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind speeds were initially strong and variable, decreasing to near calm during the early morning, then increasing again in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These trends collectively suggest the presence of a cold front moving through the region, bringing colder air, fluctuating moisture, and changing wind patterns, which could lead to variable conditions including possible precipitation in the coming hours.
