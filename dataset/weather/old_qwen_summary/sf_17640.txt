Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, indicating the presence of fog or near-saturation conditions typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind conditions were consistently light and came from the west-southwest, consistent with marine layer flow, which contributed to the cooling and fog development. These combined factors point to a classic coastal pattern, with nighttime cooling, high humidity, and low wind speeds fostering fog formation, particularly in the early hours.
