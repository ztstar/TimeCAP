Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that could contribute to muggy conditions or potential for precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late evening and early morning, with strong gusts originating from the northeast, consistent with a shift in wind direction that often accompanies frontal activity. These combined patterns suggest the likelihood of unsettled weather, including possible thunderstorms or heavy showers, especially given the convergence of high humidity, dropping pressure, and intensifying winds.
