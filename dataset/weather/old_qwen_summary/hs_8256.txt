Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or mist during the overnight period. Air pressure exhibited a significant spike around midday, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought relatively stable conditions and clear skies. Wind speeds gradually increased through the evening and into the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns point to the passage of a cold front, which has likely brought cooler, drier air and may set the stage for improved conditions in the coming hours.
