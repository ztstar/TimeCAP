Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from a cooler maritime influence to a more stable, slightly warmer regime. Humidity levels remained near saturation for much of the night and early morning, indicating fog formation or dense low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A significant pressure decline in the late night hours was accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, signaling the passage of a weather front, possibly bringing changeable conditions. The wind pattern shifted from a southerly to a more westerly and then northerly direction, consistent with dynamic atmospheric adjustments typical of coastal systems. Overall, the data point to a period of coastal fog, a transient front, and variable wind conditions that may influence visibility and comfort levels in the region.
