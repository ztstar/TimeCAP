Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, which suggests nighttime condensation and the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the mid-morning before stabilizing and slightly decreasing, pointing to the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, likely signaling the onset of a sea breeze or a change in air mass. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from stable, humid nighttime conditions to a more dynamic and warming afternoon, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and lift persist.
