Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation and increased discomfort during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, reaching a peak in the late morning before declining slightly, signaling a transition from stable conditions to a developing low-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from consistent southerly flow to more variable directions in the afternoon, with increasing speeds and a change toward easterly and northerly winds, hinting at an approaching frontal system. The combination of high humidity, rising wind speeds, and fluctuating pressure suggests a high likelihood of thunderstorm development in the coming hours, particularly during the afternoon and evening.
