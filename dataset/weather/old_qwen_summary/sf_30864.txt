Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a milder day. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with periods of near-saturation followed by sharp declines, suggesting intermittent fog or low clouds during the night and a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, signaling the passage of high-pressure systems that likely contributed to clearer skies and improved conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that may have brought in drier, warmer air. These combined patterns point to a dynamic weather transition influenced by coastal upwelling and shifting pressure systems, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
