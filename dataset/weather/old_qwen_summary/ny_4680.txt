Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night before gradually rising during the morning and early afternoon, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels surged during the early hours, remaining elevated through the night before dropping sharply in the mid-morning and maintaining low values, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, intensified in the late morning and early afternoon, particularly from the west to northwest, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly suggests a change in air mass, consistent with the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies.
