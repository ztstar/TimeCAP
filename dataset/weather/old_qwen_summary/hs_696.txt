Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sharp drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. A significant increase in air pressure occurred during the early hours, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced humidity later in the day. Humidity levels showed a dramatic swing, peaking at near saturation during the night and early morning before plummeting, suggesting a transition from a moist, unstable air mass to a drier, more stable one. Wind speeds were negligible during most of the night but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction indicating a change in air flow patterns. These conditions point to a period of atmospheric transition, with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility, though lingering dry air may suppress storm development.
