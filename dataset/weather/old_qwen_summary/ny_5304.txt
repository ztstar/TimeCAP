Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced rebound in the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply decreasing through the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable until midday, when it began to rise, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate dynamic atmospheric conditions. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier, and windier afternoon, consistent with the arrival of a frontal system or a change in air mass across the region.
