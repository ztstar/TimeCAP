Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced consistently cool temperatures with a gradual warming trend during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained persistently high, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, especially during early morning hours. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend, suggesting the influence of a stable high-pressure system that may have limited storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest to south-southeast, which could enhance coastal fog dispersion and bring cooler marine air inland. Overall, the combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a typical marine layer weather regime common in San Francisco during this season.
