Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning before dropping, suggesting a period of condensation and possible fog formation followed by clearing. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the morning and midday, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and northeasterly, aligning with a change in air mass and potential for improved air quality. These trends collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely resulting in clearer skies and mild to cool temperatures in the coming hours.
