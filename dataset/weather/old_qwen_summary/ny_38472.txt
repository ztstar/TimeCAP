Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking just before the temperature decline, suggesting the presence of overnight condensation or fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and speed, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind patterns shifted from northerly to southerly and then to a strong westerly flow, suggesting dynamic atmospheric changes, likely associated with a developing low-pressure system. These combined trends point to a transition from a cold, moist, and stable period to a more turbulent and potentially stormy phase, with implications for precipitation and worsening conditions later in the day.
