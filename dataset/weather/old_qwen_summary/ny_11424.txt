Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a strong cold air advection, likely driven by a persistent northerly to westerly airflow. Humidity levels exhibited significant variability, with prolonged periods of high moisture followed by sharp drops, suggesting intermittent mixing of air masses and possible precipitation events. Air pressure showed a dynamic pattern, with a notable rise during the early morning hours, followed by fluctuations that may reflect the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that could influence storm development. These combined trends point to an active weather pattern, potentially leading to unstable conditions and the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
