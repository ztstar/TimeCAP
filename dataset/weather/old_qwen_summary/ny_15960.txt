Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual cooling trend overnight, followed by a steady warming in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early night, remaining elevated through the pre-dawn hours before sharply declining in the morning, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the evening, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable and improving weather. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, weakening in the afternoon before picking up again in the evening, with wind directions shifting from west to southwest and then back to west, consistent with changing airflow patterns around the high-pressure system. Overall, the data points to a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a warmer, drier, and increasingly stable afternoon and evening, likely resulting in clear skies and favorable conditions in the coming hours.
