Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by coastal effects. Humidity levels exhibited a marked inverse relationship with temperature, peaking in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then rose significantly during the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds increased notably during the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts from the southwest and later shifts toward the northeast, indicating dynamic airflow changes possibly due to thermal gradients and synoptic-scale influences. These combined patterns point to a typical coastal transition from cool, foggy conditions to warmer, drier, and windier conditions in the afternoon and evening, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic weather variability.
