Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the early morning hours, peaking just before a significant drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or clearing conditions. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems affecting the region. Wind activity was generally light, with brief periods of stronger gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, primarily from the west and southwest, consistent with coastal wind patterns. These conditions point to a typical marine influence, with cool, moist air lingering overnight and a gradual transition toward clearer, drier conditions during the day.
