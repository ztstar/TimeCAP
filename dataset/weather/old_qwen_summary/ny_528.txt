Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle likely influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture accumulation and possibly fog formation during the low-temperature period. Air pressure remained consistently high, with a slight upward trend in the early hours, pointing to the influence of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings fair and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning, especially around dawn, with winds nearly calm at one point, which contributed to the development of stagnant air and higher humidity. The shift in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast and then to east-southeast in the afternoon hints at a possible change in air mass, potentially signaling an approaching weather system, although current conditions remain calm and stable.
