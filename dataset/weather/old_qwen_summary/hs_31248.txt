Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours, indicating increasing solar heating and a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply through the day, suggesting the dissipation of a nocturnal moisture layer and possible clearing skies. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a rapid drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, reaching peak values in the late evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that likely transported moist air into the region. These combined patterns suggest the potential for unstable conditions later in the night, possibly leading to scattered showers or thunderstorms, especially with the observed pressure fall and wind shifts.
