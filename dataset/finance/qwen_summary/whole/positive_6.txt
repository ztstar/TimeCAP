The S&P 500 exhibited a strong upward trend over the past 20 market days, followed by a recent pullback, suggesting potential profit-taking after a period of sustained gains. The VIX showed a marked decline early in the period, indicating reduced market fear, but spiked mid-cycle before stabilizing at lower levels, reflecting shifting risk sentiment. Global equity markets, including the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, demonstrated resilience with gradual appreciation, though recent volatility in the FTSE hints at possible underlying economic uncertainty. Gold and crude oil prices both displayed a consistent upward trajectory, signaling growing safe-haven demand and rising inflation expectations, respectively. Meanwhile, the USD strengthened against the JPY and CNY, while EUR/USD remained relatively flat, suggesting a broad dollar rally with mixed currency dynamics across major pairs.
