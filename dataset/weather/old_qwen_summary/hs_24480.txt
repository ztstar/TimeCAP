Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist during the early hours, reducing visibility and creating a damp, muggy feel. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around mid-morning, followed by fluctuating pressure readings, indicating possible atmospheric instability and the potential approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction suggesting changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to a developing low-pressure feature. These combined conditions point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and shifting airflows increasing the likelihood of afternoon showers or thunderstorms.
