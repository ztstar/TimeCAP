Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of mid-latitude climates. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours, peaking before declining through the day, suggesting a possible influx of moist air followed by drying due to increasing temperatures. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a brief spike in the early hours and a sustained drop later in the day, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with changing pressure gradients and potential storm development. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of unsettled weather, with increased chances of precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
