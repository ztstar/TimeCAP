Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced nighttime cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, reaching and maintaining saturation for much of the night and early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the night, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have facilitated the influx of moist marine air. Wind speeds showed a sudden spike in the early hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to south-southeast, consistent with a strengthening onshore flow typical of coastal fog events. The combination of near-saturation humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns strongly indicates that dense fog dominated the region during the night and early morning, significantly impacting visibility and travel conditions.
