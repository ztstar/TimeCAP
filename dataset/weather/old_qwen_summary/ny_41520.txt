Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which may have contributed to a damp or foggy feel during the early hours. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low except for a notable increase late in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the trend points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather in the coming hours, with improved conditions expected as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
