Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler overnight period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels showed a marked drop in the early hours, followed by a sharp rise and sustained high levels, suggesting the arrival of moist air and increasing potential for precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is indicative of an approaching low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction signaling changing air mass dynamics, including a shift from southerly to more westerly and northerly flows. These combined patterns point to an active weather front moving through the city, likely bringing overcast skies, increased chances of rain, and a generally unsettled atmospheric environment.
