Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the day, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with moist onshore flow typical of Gulf Coast weather patterns. These combined conditions point to a high probability of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term, especially as the system continues to develop.
