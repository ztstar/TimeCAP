Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged to saturation (100%) during the night, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late night and early morning, followed by a slow recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with strong southerly and easterly winds in the early hours giving way to more variable and generally weaker winds later in the day, with a notable increase in speed and a shift toward a northerly direction in the final hours. These combined conditions—cooler temperatures, high humidity, and declining pressure—point to a moist, unstable air mass, increasing the potential for afternoon thunderstorms or heavy precipitation if convection develops.
