Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a consistent increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-northwest, consistent with a coastal breeze pattern typical of the region. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and stable pressure suggests conditions favorable for fog formation, especially near the coast, which may persist into the early part of the next day.
