Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, persisting at high levels through mid-morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early morning, peaking around dawn, then fluctuating with minor lows, which may reflect the influence of shifting weather systems near the coast. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to easterly and then back to westerly, signaling possible changes in local wind patterns linked to marine layer movement. These conditions collectively point to the presence of a strong marine layer that developed overnight, contributed to fog and high humidity, and dissipated gradually as daytime heating and wind changes disrupted its stability.
