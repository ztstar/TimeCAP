Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the arrival of drier air, likely due to offshore winds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then dipped sharply in the late afternoon before rebounding, which may signal the passage of a weakening weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the northeast and east, consistent with a katabatic or downslope flow. The shift in wind direction from coastal to more easterly and northeasterly patterns points to changing synoptic conditions, potentially bringing clearer skies and reduced marine layer influence.
