Temperature trends show a clear overnight cooling followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of early spring or late autumn. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained stable through the night, then increased slightly in the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with a notable increase in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast, potentially indicating a shift in airflow associated with changing pressure patterns. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a drier, warmer day, with a stable and improving weather outlook for New York City.
