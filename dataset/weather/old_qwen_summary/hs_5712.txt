Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. A gradual decline in air pressure, particularly in the final six hours, suggests an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and overnight, with sustained stronger gusts from the southeast, indicating the inflow of moist air ahead of a developing frontal boundary. These conditions collectively point to an increased likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours, especially as the atmosphere remains unstable and moisture-rich.
