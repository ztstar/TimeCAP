Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Temperature trends showed a gradual increase during the day, suggesting warming air masses moving in, but with persistent coolness overnight due to high humidity and cloud cover. Humidity levels rose significantly, particularly in the late night and early morning, creating a muggy environment and increasing the likelihood of precipitation.
