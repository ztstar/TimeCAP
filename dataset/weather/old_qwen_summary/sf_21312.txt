Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog and low visibility, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and into the early morning, signaling an approaching weather system, though it stabilized slightly in the afternoon. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable but still light winds in the afternoon, suggesting a weakening of surface-level circulation. The wind direction trended from west-northwest to south-southeast, indicating a possible change in air mass flow, possibly bringing in warmer air and reducing fog coverage as the day progressed.
