Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating saturated air and increased potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, dry air aloft and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly by late evening, signaling a possible change in air mass or the passage of a weak boundary. These conditions point to a relatively calm, humid, and cool environment, with minimal convective activity but a lingering chance of fog in low-lying areas during the early morning hours.
