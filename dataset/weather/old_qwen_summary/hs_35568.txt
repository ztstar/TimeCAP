Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a cool, moist phase to a drier, warmer one. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then began to decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system and the potential approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds remained low overnight, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, which may indicate changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition from cool, humid overnight conditions to warmer, drier daytime weather, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development as the day progresses.
