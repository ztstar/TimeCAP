Over the past 24 hours, temperature fluctuations indicate a generally stable but slightly cooling trend, with minimal variation in the lower end of the range. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike during early morning and late night hours, suggesting periods of increased moisture availability, possibly linked to dew formation or low-level convergence. Air pressure dropped significantly during the early afternoon, remained low through the night, and then began to rise slightly, pointing to the influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the midday and evening, particularly from the northwest, indicating stronger atmospheric instability and potential for shifting weather patterns. The combination of fluctuating humidity, dropping pressure, and variable wind direction suggests an active boundary or frontal passage, which may lead to changing conditions such as precipitation or clearer skies in the near term.
