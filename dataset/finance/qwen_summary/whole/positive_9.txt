Over the past 20 market days, equity markets have shown a generally upward trajectory with notable resilience despite periodic volatility, particularly in the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, which recorded sustained gains amid shifting macroeconomic signals. The VIX exhibited a significant decline from elevated levels, indicating reduced market fear and increasing investor confidence, although a brief spike in the middle of the period reflected temporary risk-off sentiment. Emerging market indices, such as the Nikkei 225, displayed strong momentum before a sharp correction, suggesting potential overextension and sensitivity to external pressures. Commodity prices, particularly crude oil and gold, demonstrated upward trends, signaling inflationary concerns or supply-side disruptions, with oil breaking key resistance levels. Meanwhile, the USD strengthened against major currencies, especially JPY and CNY, reflecting tightening global monetary policy expectations and a flight to quality, while EUR/USD remained range-bound, indicating a lack of decisive directional momentum.
