Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply dropping during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to dry, clearing air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a recovery later in the day, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought fog and overcast conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and westerly directions in the early hours to more northerly and easterly flows by midday, likely driven by a change in the pressure gradient. These dynamics point to a maritime influence with fog development at night and clearing skies by late afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
