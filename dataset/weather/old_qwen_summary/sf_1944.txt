Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping through the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before beginning to decline, indicating a buildup of moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the period, suggesting the influence of an approaching low-pressure system that may bring more unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained elevated, particularly during the late evening and early morning, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined indicators suggest the onset of a marine layer and potentially foggy conditions, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with a growing likelihood of drizzle or light rain in the near term.
