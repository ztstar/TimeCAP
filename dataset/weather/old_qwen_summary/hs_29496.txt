Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, reducing visibility and creating a muggy feel. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clearing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, indicating changing synoptic-scale flow that may be associated with a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms if moisture and instability persist.
