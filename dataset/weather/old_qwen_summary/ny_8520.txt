Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a dramatic decline followed by a sharp rebound, signaling the arrival and subsequent departure of a low-pressure system associated with stormy weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the middle of the period, with strong northerly and westerly winds coinciding with the lowest temperatures and highest humidity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggests a change in atmospheric flow, likely bringing drier and cooler air, which may result in clearing skies in the coming hours.
