Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal breezes. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike during early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is common in the region during cooler periods. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning but strengthened significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing flow patterns, possibly due to evolving pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with the potential for improved visibility and reduced fog during the coming hours.
