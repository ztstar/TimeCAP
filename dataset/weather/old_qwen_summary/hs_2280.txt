Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. A significant rise in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, peaking around midday, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated, reaching their highest during the late night and early morning, likely contributing to the formation of a low-level fog or mist. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a marked increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly, suggesting a change in air mass influence. The overall pattern points to a transition from a cooler, more humid, and calm nocturnal phase to a drier, more stable, and slightly breezy daytime regime, consistent with the passage of a high-pressure ridge over the region.
