Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist air to drier, more convective conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend through the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that may signal the approach of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds remained generally low overnight but increased slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from northerly to southerly and eventually westerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. Together, these patterns suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate ahead of an approaching front.
