Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun rose. Air pressure showed a slight increase during the afternoon and early evening, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of stronger gusts in the late afternoon and early evening, primarily from the southwest and south, which may have contributed to the mixing of marine air and the clearing of fog. Overall, the data suggest a transition from a cool, foggy overnight period to a warmer, drier, and more stable daytime environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate during the summer months.
