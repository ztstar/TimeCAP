Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the overnight hours, stabilizing at a high value and signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and maintained clear skies. Wind speeds remained low to moderate throughout the period, with a consistent southerly to southeasterly flow that shifted slightly toward the west-southwest in the late evening, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising humidity, stable high pressure, and persistent wind direction implies a relatively calm and comfortable weather regime, though the high moisture content in the morning may have increased the perceived stickiness during early hours.
