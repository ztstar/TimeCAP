Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady temperature rise from early morning lows to midday highs, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining slightly, suggesting the influence of nocturnal moisture accumulation followed by daytime drying. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a developing weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, consistent with a possible change in air mass. These combined patterns point to an evolving atmospheric setup, potentially increasing the risk of convective activity later in the day.
