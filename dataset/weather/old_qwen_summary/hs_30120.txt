Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong daytime heating effect. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the midday hours before rebounding dramatically in the late night and early morning, suggesting a shift from dry to saturated air conditions. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase, which may indicate the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with stronger and more persistent winds from the southeast and east sectors, potentially signaling the arrival of a moist air mass. Combined, these trends suggest the development of unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day.
