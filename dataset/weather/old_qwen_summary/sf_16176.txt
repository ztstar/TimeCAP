Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. A sharp increase in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable spike during the night, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to southerly, consistent with marine layer dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, likely resulting in foggy mornings and potentially chilly conditions.
