Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, reaching saturation at one point, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to the cooler feel despite rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may stabilize conditions and reduce cloud cover. Wind speeds decreased substantially during the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing at dawn, but picked up again in the late afternoon, particularly from the east and southeast, possibly signaling a shift in local wind patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, increasing wind, and a steep drop in humidity suggests a transition toward clearer, drier conditions, potentially breaking the earlier foggy and cool spell.
