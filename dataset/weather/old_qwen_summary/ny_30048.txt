Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct diurnal pattern, with a prolonged period of cold conditions during the night and early morning, followed by a steady and significant warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of stable, moist air masses that likely contributed to fog or low cloud cover. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined indicators point to an approaching storm or inclement weather, with potential for precipitation and gusty conditions in the near term.
