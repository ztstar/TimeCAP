Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nocturnal temperature lows to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and increasing potential for fog or low clouds. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp spike and subsequent fluctuations, signaling the passage of a weather system that may have brought instability. Wind speeds increased steadily from dawn through midday, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with the influence of a developing or passing frontal boundary. These combined factors—high humidity, pressure changes, and increasing wind—highlight a dynamic and potentially unsettled atmospheric environment, raising the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or showers.
