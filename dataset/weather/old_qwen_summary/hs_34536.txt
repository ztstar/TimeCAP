Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained persistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that contributed to a muggy atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with notable gusts and a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, pointing to changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors suggest the approach of a more stable and drier air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day.
