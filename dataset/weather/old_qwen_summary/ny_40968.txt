Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the day, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking and remaining elevated through mid-morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air associated with a low-pressure system. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a developing storm system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, with a notable shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns tied to the storm’s influence. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
