Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the overnight hours, indicating dry air intrusion, followed by a notable increase in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking midday before slight fluctuations, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system. Wind speeds were highest during the early morning hours and decreased toward the end of the period, with wind direction shifting from a westerly to a more southerly and then easterly flow, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These trends collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, followed by a period of stabilizing, drier, and increasingly calm conditions, which may lead to clear skies and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
