Temperature showed a gradual increase throughout the day, with a sharp rise in the late afternoon followed by a decline in the evening, indicating a warming trend during peak daylight hours. Humidity steadily decreased during the morning and early afternoon, reaching a low before beginning to recover in the evening, suggesting drying air conditions. Air pressure remained nearly stable during most of the day but dropped slightly in the late afternoon before rising again, potentially signaling a passing weather front. Wind speeds fluctuated significantly, with strong and consistent winds in the morning and early afternoon, followed by a lull and then a return to stronger gusts in the evening, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted from southwest to northwest and then to more variable patterns, indicating changing airflow, possibly associated with a developing or moving storm system.
