Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged to saturation in the early hours, persisting at high levels through the night and into the morning, likely due to a stable air mass and minimal mixing. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly during the late afternoon suggests the influence of a developing low-pressure system or a frontal passage. Air pressure exhibited a brief rise during the early night, followed by fluctuations that may reflect the passage of a weather front or localized atmospheric adjustments. These combined signals point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day as warm, moist air continues to accumulate.
