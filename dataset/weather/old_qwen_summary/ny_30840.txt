Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely associated with clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which may have contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. A sustained drop in air pressure during the night and early morning, followed by a slight rebound in the late afternoon, points to the passage of a low-pressure system, consistent with the potential for precipitation or stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the overnight hours, with a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, indicating possible inflow from the Atlantic, which could bring moisture and destabilize the atmosphere. These combined factors suggest a high likelihood of unsettled weather, including the potential for rain or thunderstorms, particularly in the coming hours.
