Influenza activity has shown a sustained and significant upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with both the absolute number of positive specimens and the proportion of positive tests reaching their highest levels in the observed period. The dominance of Influenza A has been consistent, contributing most to the rising positivity rates, though Influenza B has demonstrated a notable and increasing share, particularly in recent weeks. The peak in positivity ratios occurred in the 13th to 15th weeks, followed by a gradual decline, indicating the possible onset of a slowing phase in the current respiratory virus season. Despite decreasing trends in recent weeks, the still-elevated positivity rates suggest ongoing community transmission and continued public health vigilance is warranted. The consistent rise in specimen volume alongside increasing positivity underscores the importance of testing capacity and surveillance infrastructure to support timely response efforts.
