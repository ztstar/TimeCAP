Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level fog or mist common in the region during this time of year. Air pressure showed periods of instability, with a significant drop toward the end of the observation period, indicating a possible approaching weather system or shifting frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably during the mid-morning and late evening, with stronger gusts from variable directions, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. These indicators together suggest a transition period in the local weather, possibly heralding a change in conditions such as increased cloud cover or the onset of precipitation.
