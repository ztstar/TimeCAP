Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable until mid-afternoon, when a slight drop occurred, indicating potential changes in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to more southerly and southeasterly, suggesting possible inflow of moist air. These patterns imply a transition in weather dynamics, with high humidity and increasing winds potentially setting the stage for thunderstorm development later in the day.
