Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal heating cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped sharply during the day before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a cooling front and subsequent drying trend. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the mid-morning, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with prolonged calm periods, but picked up in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south-southeast, likely due to a developing sea breeze and pressure gradient. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and consistent wind from the southeast points to a transition toward more stable and warmer conditions, potentially reducing the chance of precipitation in the near term.
