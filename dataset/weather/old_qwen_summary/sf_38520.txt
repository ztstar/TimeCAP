Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with a sharp spike in the early morning and again in the late night, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is characteristic of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a weather front, likely associated with marine layer development. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from strong offshore flow in the early hours to weaker, more variable winds later, with a reversal toward onshore winds in the late afternoon. These conditions point to the influence of a coastal front, contributing to unstable atmospheric conditions, increased fog, and potentially reduced visibility, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods.
