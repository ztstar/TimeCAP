Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly during midday, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a consistent high-pressure influence, though a slight rise in the late evening may signal a tightening of atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing during the afternoon, with a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass or the approach of a weather system. These patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a more dynamic daytime regime, which could lead to increased afternoon convection and the potential for scattered thunderstorms later in the day.
