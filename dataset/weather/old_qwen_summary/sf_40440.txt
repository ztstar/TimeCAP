Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining high, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of coastal conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, followed by a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the possible influence of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds were initially strong, particularly during the night, before tapering off during the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, fog-prone regime to a drier and more variable air mass, possibly heralding clearer skies later in the day.
