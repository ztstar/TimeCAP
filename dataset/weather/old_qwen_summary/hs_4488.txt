Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant temperature variation. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal condensation and subsequent drying. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by consistent southerly to westerly flow, enhancing heat advection and potentially supporting convective development. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and strengthening winds late in the period raises the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if instability continues to build.
