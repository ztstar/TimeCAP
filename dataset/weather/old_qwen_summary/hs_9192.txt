Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and a damp feel in the air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a strong rebound, suggesting the passage of a weather front that brought changes in conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that may have advected warmer, drier air. These combined shifts point to a dynamic weather transition, possibly setting the stage for unstable conditions or precipitation later in the day.
