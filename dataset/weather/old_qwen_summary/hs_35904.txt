Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping slightly and then surging again toward the end of the period, indicating potential moisture buildup. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds increased notably in the final hours, particularly from the southeast and east, with gusts reaching higher velocities, which may contribute to enhanced moisture transport and potential for thunderstorm development. Combined with the high humidity and weakening pressure, these conditions suggest an elevated risk of isolated or scattered thunderstorms later in the evening or overnight.
