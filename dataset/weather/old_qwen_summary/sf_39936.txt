Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during midday before spiking again in the evening, indicating possible fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the morning and midday, followed by a sharp decline in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with sustained strong gusts and a shift toward more variable wind directions, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined factors point to a transition period in the local weather, potentially bringing overcast skies, fog, or even light precipitation later in the day.
