Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in air pressure, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings more stable and drier conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours and gradually declined through the day, suggesting a transition from moist, saturated air to a drier atmosphere. Temperature remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of strong thermal gradients or frontal systems. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the period, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northwest, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined trends suggest that Houston is transitioning toward more settled weather, with decreasing cloud cover and a reduced likelihood of precipitation.
