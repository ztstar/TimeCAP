Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the period, peaking in the middle of the night before sharply declining during the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting a change in air mass. Air pressure showed a notable decrease in the early to midday hours, followed by a rebound later in the day, which is characteristic of a passing low-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the arrival of a cold front. These combined indicators point to the recent passage of a dynamic weather system, likely bringing cooler, drier conditions and potentially clearing skies in the near term.
