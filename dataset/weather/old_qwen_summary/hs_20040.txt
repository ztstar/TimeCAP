Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool nighttime phase to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before steadily decreasing, suggesting possible clearing or drying trends as the day progressed. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief drop in the early hours followed by a slight rise, which may signal the passage of a weak frontal system or localized atmospheric adjustment. Wind speeds increased notably during the latter half of the night and remained elevated through the morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from variable to predominantly from the northwest, implying changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a dynamic and evolving weather scenario, with potential implications for localized showers or thunderstorms as the air mass adjusts, particularly given the high initial humidity and wind shifts.
