Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before showing a modest decline in the afternoon, indicating a buildup of moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring further cloudiness or precipitation. Wind conditions remained consistently light and from a northerly direction throughout, contributing to a stable but increasingly damp air mass. Collectively, these trends point to a transition toward potentially overcast or foggy conditions, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with elevated moisture and weakening pressure hinting at possible precipitation later in the day.
