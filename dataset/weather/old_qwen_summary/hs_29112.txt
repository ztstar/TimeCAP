Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the early hours of the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the possible approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring further instability. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly and later to more variable directions, with increased speeds in the late evening, potentially signaling a change in airflow due to developing weather dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions becoming more humid and potentially unsettled, increasing the likelihood of precipitation later in the day.
