Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and afternoon sun. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before slightly decreasing in the afternoon, consistent with the formation and dissipation of marine fog common in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased steadily through the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the early morning and late evening, primarily from the west and southwest, reinforcing the influence of coastal wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, moderate humidity, and increasing temperatures suggests a transition toward drier and more stable weather, potentially clearing lingering fog and improving visibility in the coming hours.
