Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a buildup of heat likely driven by increasing solar radiation and stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early to mid-day hours, suggesting moist air advection, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a drier air mass or a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching a low point in the early morning, which is often associated with approaching weather systems and potential instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, indicating possible changes in synoptic-scale flow. Together, these trends suggest the development of localized convective potential, with conditions becoming increasingly favorable for afternoon or evening thunderstorms, especially given the combination of warmth, lingering moisture, and dynamic wind shifts.
