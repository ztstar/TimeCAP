Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight and early morning, dropped significantly during mid-morning, and then rose again as the day progressed, indicating potential moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise again, which suggests the passage of a low-pressure system and possible storm development. Wind speeds remained minimal until late evening, when they increased notably, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with an approaching front. These patterns collectively point to a transitional weather period, likely bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
