Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, signaling the approach of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure front, which may bring changes to the local conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted notably, suggesting changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition period, potentially leading to overcast skies and a higher likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
