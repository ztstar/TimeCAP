Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a pronounced increase during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to a damp and cool feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a gradual rise in the latter half of the period, suggesting improving weather conditions and a potential high-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southwesterly, consistent with onshore flow typical of coastal patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool, and breezy coastal environment toward clearer skies and more stable conditions as the high-pressure system strengthens.
