Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to a persistent foggy and damp feel, especially during the overnight and early morning periods. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, transitioning from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly, suggesting a change in air mass influence and possibly the approach of a marine layer. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the afternoon, indicating a developing low-pressure system that could bring further cloud cover or precipitation. The combination of high humidity, variable wind patterns, and falling pressure suggests an increased likelihood of foggy conditions and the potential for light drizzle or coastal rain in the near term.
