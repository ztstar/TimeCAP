Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal fog and afternoon sun. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture, but surged dramatically in the late evening, coinciding with the return of fog and cooler air. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase in the early hours, followed by a sustained high-pressure ridge that stabilized conditions, though a brief drop occurred in the afternoon, possibly signaling a passing weather front. Wind patterns shifted from light, variable breezes in the morning to stronger, more consistent winds in the afternoon and evening, with a change in direction indicating a shift in regional airflow, potentially related to offshore flow or a change in pressure gradients. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool coastal pattern to a drier, warmer regime, with potential for clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
