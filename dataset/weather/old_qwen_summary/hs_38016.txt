Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating near-saturated conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were modest overnight but picked up in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, signaling a possible change in air mass. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime pattern toward a drier, more variable daytime regime, which could influence afternoon convective activity.
