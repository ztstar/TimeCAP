Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before a significant drop in the midday hours, indicating a transition toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a steady rise, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased in the afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly wind directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a damp, cool, and stable night into a drier, slightly warmer, and breezier daytime pattern, consistent with the passage of a weather front.
