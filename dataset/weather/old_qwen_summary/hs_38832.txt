Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, reaching a low before sharply increasing in the late evening, suggesting the arrival of moist air, possibly from a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a consistent rise overnight, peaking in the early morning, then stabilizing and slightly declining in the afternoon—consistent with the passage of a high-pressure ridge followed by a weakening front. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly in the afternoon, hinting at a change in air mass and potential for increased moisture influx. These conditions collectively suggest the approach of unsettled weather, with increasing humidity and shifting winds indicating the likelihood of thunderstorms later in the day.
