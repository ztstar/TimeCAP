- Number of specimens tested: The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the initial 14 weeks, reflecting increasing respiratory specimen testing and rising influenza positivity, likely signaling a growing influenza season. A peak was reached in week 14, followed by a sharp decline over the subsequent six weeks, indicating a rapid waning of influenza activity. This pattern suggests a typical seasonal influenza curve with a delayed peak and swift decline, which may inform public health planning for vaccination campaigns and resource allocation.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza A: The indicator exhibits a sharp upward trend over the first 12 weeks, reaching a peak before declining steadily over the subsequent 8 weeks, suggesting a typical seasonal influenza surge followed by a rapid回落. The peak coincides with the expected winter influenza season, and the sustained high values in mid-to-late winter indicate significant community transmission. The recent decline, though substantial, remains above baseline levels, signaling ongoing activity that may warrant continued public health vigilance and preparedness.
- Number of positive specimens for Influenza B: The indicator exhibits a pronounced upward trajectory over the initial 12 weeks, signaling a rapid escalation in influenza B activity, culminating in a peak during the latter half of this period. Following the peak, a sustained and significant decline is observed, indicating a waning phase of the influenza season. The pattern suggests a typical seasonal epidemic curve, with the current data reflecting a transition from high transmission to decreasing prevalence, which may inform public health planning for resource allocation and surveillance.
- Ratio of positive specimens (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the first 14 weeks, reflecting escalating influenza activity, which peaks sharply before beginning a pronounced decline. The subsequent reduction over the final six weeks suggests a waning phase of the influenza season, with a notable drop following the peak, indicating potential exhaustion of the circulating virus or increased population immunity. The rapid rise and fall pattern aligns with typical seasonal influenza dynamics, highlighting the importance of timely surveillance and public health preparedness during peak periods.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (%): The indicator exhibits a clear and sustained upward trend over the first 14 weeks, reflecting a rapid escalation in influenza A positivity, peaking sharply before a marked decline in the subsequent weeks. The sharp drop after the peak suggests a possible waning of the influenza A wave, with levels now returning toward earlier baseline values, indicating a potential transition from peak to post-peak phase. This pattern is consistent with seasonal influenza dynamics, implying that surveillance and intervention efforts may need to shift from acute response to monitoring for resurgence or co-circulation with other respiratory pathogens.
- Ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B (%): The indicator exhibits a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with a notable acceleration in the latter half, suggesting increasing influenza B activity. A sharp rise in the final weeks indicates the potential onset or peak of an influenza B season, with high levels of positivity observed in recent weeks. This pattern implies heightened public health concern, warranting intensified surveillance, preparedness, and potential implementation of targeted prevention strategies.
