Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a stable diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at near-saturation levels, suggesting the presence of dew formation or fog, which may have impacted visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, particularly in the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward drier, more stable air, likely leading to improved conditions later in the day.
