Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling event. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which, combined with the temperature dip, suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of the city’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly during the late night and early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to westerly and then to more southerly, reflecting the influence of local topography and coastal dynamics. This combination of factors points to a transition from a moist, fog-prone environment to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely leading to improving visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
