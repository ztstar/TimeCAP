Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a steady rise in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from cooler night conditions to warming daytime temperatures. Humidity levels remained consistently high, frequently reaching saturation, which increases the likelihood of precipitation and contributes to a damp, muggy feel. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, and a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly suggests changing airflow associated with the developing system. These combined factors point to an increased probability of rain or thunderstorms, especially during the evening and overnight hours, with potentially disruptive conditions affecting outdoor activities and travel.
