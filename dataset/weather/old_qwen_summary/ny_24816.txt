Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day, with a brief dip in the mid-afternoon, suggesting possible weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased sharply in the late afternoon, particularly from the southwest, signaling the arrival of a more dynamic air mass. The shift in wind direction from predominantly west to southwest and later to southeast implies a change in atmospheric flow, potentially bringing unsettled conditions or a frontal passage in the near term.
