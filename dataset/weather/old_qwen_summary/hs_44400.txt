Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist during the early hours, likely due to radiative cooling. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, then slightly rebounded, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought overnight moisture. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and shifting directions indicating dynamic atmospheric changes, possibly linked to a developing or passing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for unstable conditions, including scattered showers or thunderstorms, especially if moisture and lift continue to build.
