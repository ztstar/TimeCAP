Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, indicating the arrival of a cold front, likely accompanied by precipitation. Humidity remained near saturation throughout, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere and a high likelihood of rain or drizzle. A steady decline in air pressure through the early morning hours signaled the approach of a low-pressure system, which has now stabilized with a gradual rise in pressure, hinting at the front's passage. Wind speeds increased notably in the latter half of the period, with stronger, more consistent winds from the northwest, consistent with post-frontal conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northwesterly supports the movement of a cold front through the region, likely bringing cooler, drier air and clearing skies in the near term.
