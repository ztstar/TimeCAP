Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily overnight before beginning a gradual rise in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking in the early hours of the night, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-night, followed by a sharp rise, indicating the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a change in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the west and south, suggesting the influence of a coastal breeze or approaching storm system. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly and then back to westerly reflects dynamic atmospheric shifts, potentially signaling a transition in weather conditions that could bring changing precipitation or clearing skies in the coming hours.
