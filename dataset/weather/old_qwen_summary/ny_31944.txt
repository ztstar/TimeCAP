Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City followed a distinct pattern, dropping through the night and early morning before gradually rising during the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase during the early morning, followed by a minor drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible passage of a weak front or pressure shift. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, potentially signaling a change in airflow patterns. The shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest and west, combined with rising temperatures and falling humidity, suggests that a drier, more stable air mass may be moving in, possibly clearing any lingering moisture and improving overall conditions.
