Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with a cooling trend through the early hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting increased moisture content that may contribute to fog formation or a damp feel. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds were relatively low in the early morning but picked up in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from westerly to southerly and then easterly, indicating changing atmospheric flow patterns. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and lingering high humidity suggests a transition toward more stable, potentially clearer conditions later in the day.
