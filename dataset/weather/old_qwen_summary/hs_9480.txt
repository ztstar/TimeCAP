Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late evening, which suggests a saturated air mass and increased potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight rise during the early morning, followed by fluctuating patterns, indicating possible unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and remained strong, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, suggesting a change in air mass flow. These combined factors—high humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns—point to a heightened chance of thunderstorms or showers later in the day.
