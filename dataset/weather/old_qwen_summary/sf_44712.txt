The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has remained exceptionally stable, with no variation in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction across all hourly measurements. This lack of change indicates a persistent and unchanging atmospheric regime, likely due to a strong, stable high-pressure system dominating the region. The consistently low humidity suggests dry atmospheric conditions, which may increase fire risk and contribute to a sensation of discomfort in outdoor settings. The steady wind from a southeasterly direction (130 degrees) implies a consistent flow around the high-pressure system, potentially channeling cooler marine air inland but without any significant mixing or turbulence. Overall, the environment has been calm and stable, with no signs of approaching weather systems or shifting conditions.
