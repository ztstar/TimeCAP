Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight before gradually rising, indicating a strong nocturnal temperature inversion. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and a change in atmospheric circulation. The abrupt rise in wind speed and shift to easterly flow in the late afternoon likely brought drier air, causing humidity to drop and potentially clearing fog in some areas. These conditions point to a dynamic transition period, with a likely increase in coastal winds and variable visibility, affecting outdoor activities and travel across the region.
