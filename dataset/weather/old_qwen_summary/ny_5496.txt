Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies. Humidity levels remained low during the initial hours but surged dramatically in the late night and early morning, persisting at high levels through midday, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air or fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable, dry, and clear conditions. Wind activity was minimal during most of the night and early morning, with brief bursts of moderate wind in the late morning and afternoon, possibly driven by localized pressure gradients. The combination of rising pressure, high humidity, and intermittent winds suggests a transition toward clearer skies and potentially cooler mornings, with conditions favorable for fog dissipation during the day.
