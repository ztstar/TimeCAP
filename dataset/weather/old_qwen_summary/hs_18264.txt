Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely due to low-level convergence. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, indicating a change in the local circulation pattern. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for increasing cloud cover and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms as the system evolves.
