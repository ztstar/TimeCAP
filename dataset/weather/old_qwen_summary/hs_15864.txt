Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the afternoon and early evening, followed by a gradual cooling trend, indicating a strong diurnal heating cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours and dropped sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a daytime convective boundary layer that suppressed moisture retention. Air pressure declined notably in the mid-to-late night, reaching a low point before slowly recovering, which may signal the passage of a weak frontal system or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased during the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. These combined factors—rising temperatures, falling pressure, and shifting winds—suggest an environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorm development, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening hours.
