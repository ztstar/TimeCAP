Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with elevated values in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of fog or marine layer conditions, which are common in the area during certain times of year. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning before rebounding slightly in the afternoon, signaling the approach and passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning hours, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with onshore flow that often enhances coastal fog and cooling. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then northeasterly throughout the day reflects dynamic airflow changes, potentially influencing cloud cover and precipitation likelihood in the coming hours.
