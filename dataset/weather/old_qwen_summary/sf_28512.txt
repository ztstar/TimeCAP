Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which often affects coastal areas. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, signaling the approach of a weather system, possibly associated with a marine layer or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, suggesting changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These conditions collectively point to the influence of a strong marine layer and the potential for foggy or overcast conditions, particularly in the early morning hours, with a gradual clearing trend as the day progressed.
