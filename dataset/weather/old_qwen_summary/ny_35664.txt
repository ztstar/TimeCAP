Over the past 24 hours, temperatures gradually increased, indicating a steady warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity remained consistently near saturation, suggesting a high likelihood of precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, especially in the final six hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speed increased steadily throughout the day, with a notable rise in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined factors point to an evolving and potentially unstable weather pattern, increasing the risk of rain or thunderstorms in New York City.
