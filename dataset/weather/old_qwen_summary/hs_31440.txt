Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during midday, pointing to high-pressure dominance and generally fair weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing circulation patterns, possibly linked to a frontal influence or local convective activity. Together, these trends indicate a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier afternoon, with moderate wind activity that could support the development of localized storms if instability persists.
