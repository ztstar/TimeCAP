Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a significant overnight drop, followed by a steady rise during the day, indicating a cold night transitioning into a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and then declined sharply, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed, which may contribute to clearer skies later. Air pressure remained relatively stable during the night but exhibited a notable decrease in the early morning, followed by a slight recovery, signaling possible changes in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in direction from southerly to more westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, potentially leading to improving weather conditions with drier air and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
