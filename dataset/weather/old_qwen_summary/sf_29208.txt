Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before stabilizing, indicating a sustained marine influence and potential for fog formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, but there was a distinct shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly flow in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in synoptic-scale dynamics. These patterns suggest a transition from coastal fog and cool conditions to clearer skies and a more stable atmosphere, with implications for reduced wind and improved visibility in the coming hours.
