Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, signaling a significant cooling trend likely associated with a passing cold front. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking near saturation, followed by a sharp drop in the late morning and afternoon, indicating the arrival of drier air behind the front. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has since stabilized. Wind patterns shifted from southeasterly to more westerly and then northerly directions, consistent with a change in synoptic flow accompanying the cold front. These combined indicators point to a transition from a humid, stable environment to a cooler, drier, and more stable air mass, which may lead to clearer skies and lower chances of precipitation in the near term.
