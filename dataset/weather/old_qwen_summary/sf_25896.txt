Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of dense fog or low stratus clouds common in the region during this time of year. A significant rise in air pressure occurred during the early morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were strongest during the early evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing synoptic conditions and the influence of local topography. Overall, the data indicate a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable maritime environment to a warmer, drier, and more variable afternoon, typical of a coastal California day influenced by marine layer dynamics and diurnal heating.
