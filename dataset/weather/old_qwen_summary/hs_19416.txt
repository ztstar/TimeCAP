Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of near-constant high humidity, indicating a moist and stable air mass enveloping the region. Temperature remained relatively low during the early morning hours before gradually rising, suggesting a slow warming trend as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds decreased notably over the last 12 hours, with winds shifting to a more southerly direction, which may enhance moisture advection and contribute to potential instability later. These combined indicators suggest that while conditions have been stable and damp, the gradual increase in pressure and weakening winds could presage a transition toward more moderate and potentially drier weather in the near term.
