A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a gradually warming day. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight period, remaining elevated through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a clearing trend later in the day. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is often associated with approaching or passing weather systems. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south-southeast sectors, contributing to more dynamic atmospheric conditions. The combination of dropping pressure, rising temperatures, and increased wind activity implies the potential for changing weather, possibly including precipitation or storm development later in the day.
