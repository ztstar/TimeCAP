Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a notable rise in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of warming air masses. Humidity increased steadily throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before slightly declining, indicating moisture accumulation and possible condensation processes. Air pressure declined significantly during the middle of the night, reaching a low point before rebounding, which is characteristic of an approaching or passing frontal system. Wind speeds intensified dramatically in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These combined trends suggest a developing or recent weather disturbance, potentially bringing precipitation or stormy conditions later in the day.
