Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a notable nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the day, indicating a possible transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure remained stable during the initial phase but experienced a significant drop during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a brief lull in the early morning and a notable increase in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to a more westerly flow. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a developing weather front, potentially bringing precipitation or unstable conditions in the near term.
