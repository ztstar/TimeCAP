Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, reducing visibility. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, associated with stable and generally fair conditions. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with southerly and easterly flows dominating overnight and transitioning to more variable directions in the afternoon, including stronger gusts from the south and west. These conditions suggest a transition toward drier, more stable air, but the lingering moisture and recent pressure rise may increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if sufficient heating and lift occur.
