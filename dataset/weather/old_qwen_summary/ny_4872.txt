Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before midday, suggesting moisture accumulation in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift to more northerly and easterly wind directions, consistent with an evolving storm system. These combined factors point to an increasing likelihood of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions later in the day.
