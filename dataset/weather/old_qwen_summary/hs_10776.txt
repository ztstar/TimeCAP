Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooldown during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply mid-morning, only to rebound late in the day, indicating possible moisture influx or localized convective activity. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, followed by a slight rebound in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southeasterly and then southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns suggest the influence of a developing weather system, potentially increasing the risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
