Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, indicating the passage of a weather front—likely a low-pressure system moving through, succeeded by a high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds remained generally light during the night but increased substantially in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift to stronger winds from the northwest, consistent with the arrival of clearing skies and cooler air. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and decreasing humidity suggests improving conditions, with the potential for clearer skies and a more stable atmosphere in the coming hours.
