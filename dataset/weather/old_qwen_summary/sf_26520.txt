Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cooling trend likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation, which diminished during midday as temperatures rose and winds increased. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and potentially signaling the approach of a weather system. Persistent strong winds from the northwest and west during the early hours gave way to calm conditions at dawn, followed by a resurgence of moderate winds from the west and southwest in the afternoon. These dynamics point to an evolving coastal weather pattern, with the potential for fog dissipation and clearing skies later in the day, though residual moisture may linger into the evening.
