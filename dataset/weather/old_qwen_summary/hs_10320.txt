Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of significant cooling likely tied to a passing frontal system. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, particularly in the early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation that may have contributed to fog or low cloud formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a high-pressure system building in and stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds showed a marked increase during the early morning and late afternoon, with directional shifts suggesting changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to a developing surface low or convergence zone. These combined trends point to a dynamic transition period, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day, though lingering moisture may support scattered showers.
