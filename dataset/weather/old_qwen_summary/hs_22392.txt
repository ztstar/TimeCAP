Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining near saturation through midday, suggesting high moisture content in the air that could support fog or drizzle formation. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a notable increase in the afternoon before a decline in the evening, hinting at a possible shifting weather system approaching the region. Wind speeds decreased through the night and early morning, then stabilized in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in airflow that may be associated with a developing low-pressure influence. Collectively, these patterns suggest a transition period with high humidity and weakening winds, increasing the potential for localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
