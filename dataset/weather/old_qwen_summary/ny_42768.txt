Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a gradual rise, peaking in the late afternoon before declining slightly, indicating a warming trend during the day followed by a cooling night. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture and a brief spike to saturation, suggesting potential for fog or drizzle during the early morning hours. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to westerly, which may indicate a change in air mass. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a damp, stable atmosphere to a drier, more settled environment, likely leading to improved visibility and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
