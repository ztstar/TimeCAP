Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by a drier, more stable regime. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night and early morning, with a brief dip and subsequent recovery, hinting at the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and south-southwest, consistent with the development of a daytime sea breeze or the influence of a developing convection system. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially given the moisture buildup and atmospheric instability observed.
