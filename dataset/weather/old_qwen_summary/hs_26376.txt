Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming cycle through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining significantly as temperatures increased, suggesting the presence of a stable boundary layer that suppressed evaporation. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, followed by a gradual decline, signaling a transition from a high-pressure system that brought clear conditions to a weakening influence, potentially allowing for the development of convective activity later. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the period, with a slight intensification in the late afternoon, coinciding with changes in wind direction that suggest shifting synoptic patterns. The combination of rising temperatures, declining humidity, and fluctuating wind patterns indicates a growing potential for afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if moisture re-enters the lower atmosphere.
