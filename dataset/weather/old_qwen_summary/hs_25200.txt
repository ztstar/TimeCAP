Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and early evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region's climate. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated through midday, suggesting moisture accumulation likely linked to nocturnal condensation or low-level inflow. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, which may signal the approach of a moist air mass or developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the final hours, particularly from the west to southwest, potentially indicating a strengthening surface wind field associated with dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined indicators suggest that Houston may be entering a period of unstable weather, with heightened potential for afternoon thunderstorms due to the convergence of warm, moist air and increasing wind shear.
