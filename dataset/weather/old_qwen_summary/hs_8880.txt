Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn period, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility during those hours. A notable atmospheric pressure fluctuation occurred in the late afternoon, marked by a sharp rise followed by a significant drop, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have triggered localized showers or thunderstorms. Wind patterns shifted dramatically overnight, transitioning from a consistent easterly flow to a strong southerly and then a northerly direction, which may have facilitated the movement of moist air and contributed to instability. These combined factors indicate a dynamic and potentially volatile weather regime, increasing the risk of sudden storms or changing conditions in the near term.
