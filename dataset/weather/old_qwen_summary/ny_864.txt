Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cold night and warming daytime. Humidity levels were relatively stable throughout the night, with a slight increase in the early hours followed by a pronounced drop during midday, suggesting dry air infiltration. Air pressure steadily increased overnight, peaking in the early afternoon before declining slightly, which is consistent with the passage of a high-pressure system that has since begun to weaken. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a notable lull in the late afternoon and evening, though winds picked up again toward the end of the period, particularly from the southeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast suggests an approaching low-pressure system, which could bring increased cloud cover and a potential for precipitation in the coming hours.
