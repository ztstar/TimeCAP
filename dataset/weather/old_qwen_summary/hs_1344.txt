Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation levels, which contributed to a heavy, oppressive feel and likely supported the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a gradual decline overnight, reaching a low before rebounding in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions near dawn, but increased substantially in the late afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest, suggesting the influence of a developing onshore flow. These combined factors point to a transition from a stable, moist night to a more dynamic and potentially storm-prone daytime environment, with increased wind and warming creating conditions favorable for convective activity.
