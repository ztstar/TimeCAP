Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early hours, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then sharply declined, suggesting drier air moving in after the front passed. Air pressure showed a notable decrease during the afternoon, coinciding with strong winds and a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the southwest, which is typical of storm system development. The wind speed increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, likely linked to the low-pressure system that passed through. These patterns point to a dynamic weather transition, with the city likely experiencing stormy conditions earlier in the day and clearing skies with cooler, drier air following the system’s passage.
