Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely influenced by clear skies. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a shift from stable to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late evening, reaching its lowest point before stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the morning and evening, with a consistent southerly to westerly flow in the early hours and a shift toward more easterly and northerly directions later, indicating changing wind patterns associated with frontal movement. These combined indicators point to an approaching weather system, potentially bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
