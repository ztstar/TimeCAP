Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. A stable air pressure pattern prevailed throughout most of the period, with a slight drop observed in the late afternoon, indicating potential for developing instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then southeasterly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment toward a drier, more dynamic afternoon regime, which could influence local convective activity later in the day.
