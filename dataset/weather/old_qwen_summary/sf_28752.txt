Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature fluctuation, with a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase in the late night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night into the early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, before stabilizing and slightly rising later in the day. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the early morning, with strong southerly to easterly winds associated with the low-pressure development, potentially bringing marine air inland. These conditions suggest a period of unstable and potentially foggy weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with the potential for cool, damp conditions persisting into the next day.
