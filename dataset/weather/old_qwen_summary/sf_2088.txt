Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cooling pattern typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with prolonged periods of high moisture in the early morning and midday, punctuated by brief drops, suggesting intermittent fog formation and dissipation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the morning, peaking in the midday hours before stabilizing, which points to the influence of a developing high-pressure system enhancing stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early evening, with gusts from the northwest, tapering off significantly by late night and early morning, consistent with a weakening marine layer. The wind direction shifted from predominantly northwest to more easterly and southerly, particularly in the latter half of the period, implying a possible change in airflow dynamics, potentially signaling the onset of a shift in local weather patterns.
