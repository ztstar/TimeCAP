Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before modestly rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for extended periods, indicating persistent fog formation and low visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal systems passing through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, driven by strong, consistent flow from the west and southwest, which likely contributed to marine layer development. The shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late afternoon may signal a weakening of the coastal influence, potentially allowing for some clearing later in the day.
