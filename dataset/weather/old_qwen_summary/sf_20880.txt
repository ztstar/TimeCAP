Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, with relative humidity remaining at or near 100% for much of the night and early morning, indicating significant moisture accumulation in the atmosphere. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point just before dawn, followed by a gradual increase during the day, suggesting a cooling trend that may have been influenced by marine layer development. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the night and into the early morning, with a notable drop in the latter half, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm, while wind direction shifted significantly from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics and possible influence from coastal upwelling or frontal passage. These conditions collectively point to a stable marine layer with potential for fog formation and limited air movement, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, and may continue to affect visibility and morning commute conditions.
