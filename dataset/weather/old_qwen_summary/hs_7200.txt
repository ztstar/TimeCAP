Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler night phase to a warming day. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass dynamics. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, especially during mid-morning, culminating in a notable increase in the late afternoon, which often precedes improving weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light except for a brief surge in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and changing wind patterns points to a transition toward more stable, drier weather conditions in the coming hours.
