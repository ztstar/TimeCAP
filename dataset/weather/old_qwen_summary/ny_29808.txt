Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising, indicating a cold night followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels showed a notable drop in the late evening and early morning, followed by a sharp increase during the early hours, suggesting the passage of a cold front or precipitation event. Air pressure rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, with strongest gusts coming from the west to northwest, consistent with a developing synoptic-scale system. The combination of falling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition from unsettled to clearer skies, likely leading to colder, drier weather in the coming hours.
