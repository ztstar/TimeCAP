Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the late hours, which suggests increasing moisture content in the air and potential for fog or low visibility. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, reaching its lowest point in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather.
