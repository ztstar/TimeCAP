Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable nocturnal period to a developing daytime heating phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moist air masses and possible clearing conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, consistent with the influence of a developing frontal system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to increasingly westerly and southerly suggests changing air flow patterns, potentially bringing in cooler, drier air and setting the stage for variable conditions in the coming hours.
