Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests a strong likelihood of fog formation or persistent low clouds, typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure declined steadily throughout the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring increased cloud cover and the potential for light precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light, with a complete lull during the early morning hours, followed by a return to gentle breezes later in the day, suggesting a shift in local wind patterns. The wind direction shifted significantly from southwest to northeast in the early morning and then back toward the southeast by evening, reflecting the influence of evolving synoptic-scale flow and possible onshore breezes.
