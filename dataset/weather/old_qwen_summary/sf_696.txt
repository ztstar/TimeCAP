Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting dense fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum observed in the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and morning before showing a gradual decline, hinting at the potential approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were strongest during the late evening and early morning, with consistent northerly to westerly flow, which supports the presence of onshore marine air and fog intrusion. The shift toward lighter, more variable winds in the afternoon, coupled with a rise in temperature and decrease in humidity, suggests a break in the marine layer and the possibility of clearer skies developing later in the day.
