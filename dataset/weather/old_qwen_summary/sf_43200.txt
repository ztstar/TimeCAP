Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation during the early morning, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that diminished as temperatures climbed and winds increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the afternoon, indicating a persistent high-pressure system that has helped maintain clear skies and dry conditions in the latter part of the day. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with coastal dynamics. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and variable winds points to a typical marine layer pattern, which is common in San Francisco and may lead to foggy conditions in the early morning hours if the trend continues.
