Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal climate dynamics. Humidity remained consistently near saturation levels throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which is common in the region during this time of year. Air pressure showed a slight but steady increase, particularly in the latter part of the day, signaling improving atmospheric stability and potential clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast direction, likely driven by a developing coastal breeze or synoptic-scale flow. The combination of persistent high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, slightly warmer weather later in the day.
