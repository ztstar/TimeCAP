Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning hours, particularly from the west and southwest, suggesting strong onshore flow typical of coastal inversions. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, with winds turning to the southeast and then back to the west, hinting at dynamic changes in pressure systems. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests the persistence of a marine layer, likely leading to foggy conditions and potentially reduced visibility in coastal areas.
