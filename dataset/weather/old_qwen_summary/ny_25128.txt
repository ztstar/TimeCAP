Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, especially given the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but declined slightly in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, shifting from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, which may reflect changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting winds implies a higher likelihood of precipitation or overcast conditions in the near term.
