Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with saturated conditions in the early morning and midday, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, typical of the region’s marine layer. A pronounced shift in wind direction from southeast to west-southwest, accompanied by elevated wind speeds, coincided with periods of low pressure and high humidity, pointing to the influence of onshore flow and coastal upwelling. The recurring pattern of pressure drops and wind changes during the night and early morning hours indicates active atmospheric instability, likely driven by the interaction between marine air and land surface heating. These conditions collectively suggest a period of persistent coastal fog and cool, damp mornings, with potential for clearing later in the day as the marine layer weakens.
