Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before rebounding sharply in the afternoon. Humidity remained near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating widespread moisture presence, which likely contributed to the development of fog or low cloud cover. A notable rise in air pressure during the late evening and early morning suggests the passage of a high-pressure system, which may have driven drier conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and northwesterly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for clearing skies. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more dynamic daytime pattern, which could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential in the coming hours.
