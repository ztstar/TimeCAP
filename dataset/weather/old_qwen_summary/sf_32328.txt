Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight but intensified during mid-morning and remained strong in the late morning and early afternoon, particularly from the west-southwest, consistent with typical coastal breezes. The shift in wind direction later in the day, including periods of calm and variable flow, may indicate changing synoptic patterns, potentially setting the stage for a transition in the local weather regime.
