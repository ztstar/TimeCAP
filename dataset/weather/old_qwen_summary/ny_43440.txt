Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which strongly suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning before a noticeable rise, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more stable environment, likely leading to improved visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
