Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar radiation and a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, peaking at saturation, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition to drier air, possibly due to a change in wind direction. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but generally remained stable, with a brief dip during midday, which may have coincided with the onset of a weakening front or localized convection. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that could herald a more dynamic weather pattern. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
