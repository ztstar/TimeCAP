A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely brought about deteriorating weather conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking at very high levels before declining, indicating possible precipitation or fog formation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, consistent with storm passage. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before beginning a gradual recovery, reflecting the cooling influence of the passing system. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from stable to unstable weather, likely resulting in rain, strong winds, and a noticeable temperature drop during the period.
