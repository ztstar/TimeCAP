Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in air pressure, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a strong low-pressure system. Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before rising slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a cooling trend followed by a gradual recovery. Humidity remained near saturation during the night and early morning, which contributed to the development of fog and reduced visibility. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with a shift to more variable and stronger winds from the northwest and west, consistent with storm dynamics. The combination of falling pressure, sustained high humidity, and strong winds points to a period of active and potentially disruptive weather, likely including rain or storms.
