Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels reached saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, which dissipated later as temperatures rose and humidity decreased. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced wind. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, potentially pushing marine air further inland. The shift in wind direction from coastal to more easterly and southerly flow suggests changing atmospheric dynamics, possibly signaling the approach of a transition in weather patterns.
