Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely contributing to fog formation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred around midday, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system, which may have brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and then northerly, consistent with coastal influences and the movement of a frontal system. These conditions point to a transition from a damp, cool period to a drier and slightly warmer phase, potentially improving visibility and reducing fog in the coming hours.
