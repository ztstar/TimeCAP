A significant drop in air pressure during the night and early morning signaled the passage of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply during this period, peaking before declining, which suggests the system brought moist air and potential for precipitation. Temperature followed a distinct pattern, cooling through the night before gradually warming into the afternoon, indicating a front passing through the area. Wind direction shifted dramatically from southerly to westerly and then to easterly, consistent with the movement of the low-pressure system and the subsequent influence of a high-pressure system. The return to stable pressure and rising temperatures late in the period suggests improving weather, with clearing skies and more favorable conditions expected in the near term.
