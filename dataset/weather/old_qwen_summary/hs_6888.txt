Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining through the morning, suggesting the presence of nocturnal moisture accumulation likely linked to a stable boundary layer. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure ridge that may have contributed to clearing skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds remained low overall, with brief increases during the late evening and early morning, coinciding with shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly, hinting at changing air mass influences. These indicators point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more stable daytime condition, with little immediate threat of precipitation but potential for heat buildup later in the day.
