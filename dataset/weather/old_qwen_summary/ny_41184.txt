Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low around dawn before gradually rising again in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced increase during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation just before sunrise, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, calm weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west-southwest, coinciding with a shift in wind direction that may signal the approach of a changing air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing winds suggests improving conditions, with a likely transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable temperatures in the coming hours.
