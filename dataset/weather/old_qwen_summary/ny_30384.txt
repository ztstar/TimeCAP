Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City dropped significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning, culminating in a low-pressure trough, suggests the arrival of a weather system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts approaching 12 m/s, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to northerly, indicating the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These conditions collectively point to the approach of a storm system, with potential for rain and gusty winds in the near term.
