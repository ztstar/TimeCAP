Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting a dry air mass moving in. A steady decline in air pressure, particularly in the late evening and early morning, indicates a developing low-pressure system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds diminished substantially after midday, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a shifting weather pattern, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
