Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. A marked increase in humidity, peaking near saturation, coincided with the lowest temperatures, indicating the presence of fog or dense mist, particularly during the overnight period. Air pressure showed a steady rise, culminating in a sharp spike in the early morning, suggesting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the cooling and stabilization of conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, with a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction from easterly to southerly, signaling a shift in atmospheric flow that may have brought in warmer air and disrupted the fog layer. Overall, the combination of cooling, high humidity, and wind shifts points to a transition from a fog-prone, marine-influenced regime to a drier, more stable pattern, which could lead to clearer skies and more variable daytime temperatures in the coming hours.
