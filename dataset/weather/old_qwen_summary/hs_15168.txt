Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the period, spiking to near saturation during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, indicating prolonged moisture accumulation. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early hours, followed by a sharp drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate during the day, with a significant reduction overnight, while wind direction shifted from southerly to southeasterly and then to easterly, aligning with the movement of the developing weather system. These patterns suggest the potential for thunderstorm development later in the night or early morning, driven by high moisture, warming temperatures, and a weakening pressure gradient.
