Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a nocturnal dew point increase followed by drying air during daytime heating. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the midday hours, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief intensification during the early evening, and wind direction shifted from west-southwest to southeast, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable wind patterns suggests improving weather conditions, with the likelihood of clearing skies and a transition toward drier, more comfortable air later in the day.
