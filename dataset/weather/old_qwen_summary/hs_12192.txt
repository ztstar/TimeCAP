Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the influence of nocturnal condensation and subsequent mixing. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or developing weather instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and northeasterly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward potentially unstable conditions, with increasing moisture and wind, which could lead to thunderstorm development later in the day.
