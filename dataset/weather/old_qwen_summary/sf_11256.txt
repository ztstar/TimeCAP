Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels showed a significant spike during the early morning hours, indicating potential fog formation, which later decreased as temperatures rose and winds picked up. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but showed a notable drop toward the end of the period, suggesting an approaching weather system. Wind conditions were generally light and consistent, with a shift in direction during the early morning and late afternoon, possibly signaling a change in local circulation patterns. These observations suggest the city transitioned from a cool, fog-prone night to a drier, slightly warmer day, with potential for changing weather conditions later.
