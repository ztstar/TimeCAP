Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady drop in temperature, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of nocturnal cooling and early morning stabilization. Humidity remained near saturation for most of the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region during transitional seasons. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the late night and early morning, but intensified significantly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with the influence of a developing coastal breeze pattern. These combined trends point to a transition from a foggy, calm overnight period toward a more stable, slightly breezy afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
