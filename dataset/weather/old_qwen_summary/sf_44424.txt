Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and steadily declining into the night before slowly recovering in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation and remaining at 100% for an extended period, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere and contributed to the fog conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a notable shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then back to offshore, reflecting dynamic local circulation patterns influenced by coastal topography. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and a stable high-pressure environment strongly supports persistent fog and potentially cool, damp conditions, which are characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate, particularly in the early morning hours.
