Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before beginning a gradual回升 in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, reaching saturation by early morning, indicating the potential for fog or low-lying clouds. A steady decline in air pressure during the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift to more northerly and westerly directions, consistent with an approaching frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds points to a high likelihood of precipitation, particularly in the coming hours.
