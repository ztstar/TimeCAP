Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low during the early morning hours before gradually warming toward the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which contributed to the perception of dampness and fog, typical of the city’s microclimate. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sustained period of high pressure, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and reduced chances of precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow during most of the night and early morning, shifting slightly toward the southwest in the late afternoon. The combination of high humidity, moderate winds, and stable pressure indicates persistent fog and possibly chilly conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
