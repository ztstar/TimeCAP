Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds and created a muggy feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight before a slight increase in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system approaching the region. Wind conditions were calm during the night, with minimal movement, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, shifting from southerly to westerly directions, possibly signaling changing air masses. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and increasing wind suggests the potential for developing convective activity, particularly if instability continues to build.
