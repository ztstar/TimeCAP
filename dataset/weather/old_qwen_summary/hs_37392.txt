Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, starting moderate, spiking during the night, and then falling to low levels during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a mix of nocturnal moisture accumulation and daytime drying. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast and then back to the west and south, signaling changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. The overall pattern points to a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable conditions, likely reducing the chance of thunderstorms and improving air quality for the region.
