Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, particularly during the overnight hours, indicating a moist air mass that contributed to a muggy feel. Air pressure steadily declined, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and overnight, with a shift toward more southerly to southeasterly directions, consistent with inflow from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern conducive to thunderstorm activity, especially during the late evening and early morning hours.
