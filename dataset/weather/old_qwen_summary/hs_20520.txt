Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a progressively warmer day. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation in the early morning and maintaining near-constant levels through midday, which significantly increases the perceived discomfort and suggests a high likelihood of dew formation or fog. Air pressure showed a continuous decline throughout the period, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that may bring unstable conditions and potential precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a consistent shift toward southerly to easterly directions in the early hours, which may facilitate moist air advection from the Gulf of Mexico. The sustained high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing temperatures collectively point to a high probability of developing thunderstorms or heavy rain later in the day, particularly if convective instability builds.
