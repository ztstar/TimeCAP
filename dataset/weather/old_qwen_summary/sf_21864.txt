Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover typical of San Francisco’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend toward the end of the period, indicating a possible approaching weather system, though not yet a strong front. Wind speeds remained relatively consistent with a shift toward more westerly and southerly directions in the afternoon, consistent with coastal influences and onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a cool, moist, and stable coastal environment, with a potential for lingering fog or drizzle, especially in the early morning hours.
