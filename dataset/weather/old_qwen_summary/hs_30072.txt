Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily in the afternoon and evening hours, indicating a shift toward more stable and warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near the end of the period, which suggests saturated air and a heightened potential for fog or localized precipitation. Air pressure showed significant variability, with a notable drop in the early morning hours followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable weather. Wind speeds increased during the mid-to-late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with a frontal passage or storm system influence. These combined factors point to a period of unsettled weather, with elevated moisture and dynamic atmospheric conditions increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
