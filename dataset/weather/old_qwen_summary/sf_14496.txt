Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the late night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked shift, remaining high through the early hours before plummeting during midday, then rising again in the evening, indicating a possible transition between air masses. Air pressure peaked in the early morning and remained elevated before declining sharply overnight, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds surged dramatically in the midday hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic weather system moving through the region, likely bringing cooler temperatures and increasing cloud cover in the near term.
