Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically after midnight, remaining consistently high through the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unstable and overcast conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and eventually easterly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that may bring drier and more variable conditions. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds points to a transition period likely bringing changing weather, including possible fog dissipation and increasing windiness as the day progresses.
