Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels climbed sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained light in the early hours, increased in the late afternoon, and spiked in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather shift, with the potential for developing storms or unsettled conditions later in the day.
