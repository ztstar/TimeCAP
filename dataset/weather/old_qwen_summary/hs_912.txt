Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, especially in low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the night and early morning, then gradually increased through the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow that may have transported moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of rising temperatures, declining humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more stable, fair weather conditions in the coming hours.
