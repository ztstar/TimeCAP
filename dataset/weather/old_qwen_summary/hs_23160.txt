Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the onset of daytime heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially in the early morning and overnight hours, indicating saturated air conditions favorable for fog or dew formation. A steady decline in air pressure throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system, points to the potential for developing storms or unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that could bring in moist, unstable air. These combined factors suggest a heightened risk of thunderstorms, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours.
