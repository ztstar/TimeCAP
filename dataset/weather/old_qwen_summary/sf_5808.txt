Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dense moisture, which then sharply declined during the afternoon, likely due to clearing skies and increased solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the day, with a notable drop in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a weather system or shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, with strong onshore flow from the northwest during the night giving way to calm conditions in the early morning, followed by a resurgence of moderate to strong winds from the southeast in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow. The combination of high morning humidity, low wind, and a brief pressure dip suggests a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover in the early hours, which likely dissipated as temperatures rose and winds increased, contributing to clearer skies later in the day.
