Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before modest recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high in the early hours, suggesting fog or low cloud formation, which sharply decreased mid-morning, indicating a clearing of marine layer conditions. A notable rise in air pressure occurred around midday, peaking dramatically and then stabilizing, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud development and improved visibility. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late night and early morning, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from the south to the west and then northward, reflecting dynamic changes in local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy coastal environment to clearer, drier conditions, with implications for comfortable daytime weather and reduced likelihood of precipitation.
