Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the early morning hours before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the overnight hours and remaining near saturation, indicating a strong potential for fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds gradually intensified during the late night and early morning, with winds shifting from southeasterly to northeasterly, aligning with a developing gradient pressure pattern. This combination of cooling, high moisture, and strengthening winds points to a transition toward more stable, potentially clear conditions by morning, though lingering dampness may persist.
