Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, peaking dramatically during the early morning hours before plummeting sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a significant change in air mass. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained low during the night but increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a marine-influenced, foggy environment to a drier, clearer, and slightly warmer regime, typical of a weakening coastal fog event followed by a return to sunny conditions.
