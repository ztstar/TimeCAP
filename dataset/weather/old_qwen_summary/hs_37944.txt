Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating and possible air mass changes. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to a drier, more unstable atmosphere. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late evening and early morning, consistent with the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, signaling changing synoptic-scale flow and potential for storm development. These combined patterns suggest an evolving weather regime with increasing instability and the potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
