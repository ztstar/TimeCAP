Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise during the late afternoon and evening, indicating the onset of a warm period likely driven by solar heating and weakening atmospheric stability. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking in the overnight period before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions, possibly due to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable until mid-afternoon, when a gradual drop occurred, hinting at the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southwest, consistent with a change in circulation associated with the evolving pressure gradient. These combined trends suggest a transition toward potentially unstable atmospheric conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
