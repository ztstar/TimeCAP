Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the mid to late hours, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then to easterly, hinting at changing air circulation patterns possibly associated with a frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable and drier conditions, though lingering high humidity could still support localized afternoon showers if convective activity develops.
