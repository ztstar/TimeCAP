Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the overnight period, suggesting widespread condensation and potential for fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before slightly declining, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that has likely brought drier, more stable air. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions persisting through the early hours, followed by a gradual increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, hinting at changing airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest that Houston is transitioning from a period of high moisture and calm air toward a more stable, drier, and slightly breezier regime, with low risk of precipitation but possible discomfort from residual humidity in the late afternoon.
