A pronounced cooling trend occurred overnight, with temperatures steadily decreasing into the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly during the same period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained stable through the night, with a slight increase during the early hours, indicating a high-pressure system influence. Wind activity was minimal throughout most of the night, with a brief increase in speed and a shift in direction in the late afternoon, likely associated with a local breeze or sea-surface interaction. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and low wind suggests an increased likelihood of fog, particularly near coastal areas, which is consistent with San Francisco’s typical microclimate patterns.
