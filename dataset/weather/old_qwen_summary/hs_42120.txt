Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal heating pattern typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and overnight hours, peaking in the mid-to-late night before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with the approach of a weakening low-pressure system or a developing convection zone. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest and west, with sustained higher gusts in the evening, potentially signaling the onset of convective activity. The shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west, combined with rising temperatures and decreasing humidity, indicates a possible increase in thunderstorm potential later in the day.
