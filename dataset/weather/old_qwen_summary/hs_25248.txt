Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, indicating potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the lowest temperature period. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a sustained high-pressure regime, suggesting the arrival of stable, fair weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in direction from southerly to westerly, possibly signaling the influence of a passing frontal system. The combination of elevated humidity, falling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a high likelihood of overnight precipitation or persistent overcast conditions, with implications for morning commute and outdoor activities.
