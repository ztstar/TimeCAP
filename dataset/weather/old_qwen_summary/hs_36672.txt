Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, likely due to a shift in air mass. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture, especially during the early and late hours, suggesting potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings more stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the northeast and east, possibly indicating a developing frontal influence. The consistent wind direction from the east-northeast suggests a prevailing onshore flow, which may contribute to moisture advection and could influence future precipitation chances.
