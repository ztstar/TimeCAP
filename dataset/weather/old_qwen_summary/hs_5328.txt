Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures peaking during the late afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, indicating the influence of a nocturnal temperature inversion. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% during the early morning hours, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the early hours, followed by stabilization and a slight decline, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or approaching frontal influence. Wind speeds intensified during the early evening and remained elevated overnight, with shifts in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, signaling possible changes in air mass movement. These combined factors point to a transition period, likely involving the passage of a cold front, which could lead to clearing skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
