Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and dipping substantially in the midday, suggesting the influence of coastal fog and diurnal air mass changes. Air pressure exhibited a strong pattern of fluctuation, with repeated spikes and drops, indicating dynamic atmospheric conditions, possibly tied to shifting weather systems and frontal passages. Wind activity was minimal during much of the night and early morning, but intensified late in the day, particularly from the north and northeast, which may have contributed to the dispersal of fog and stabilization of the boundary layer. Overall, the data point to a transition period in the weather, with coastal influences dominating, leading to variable conditions that could result in foggy mornings and clearer, breezier afternoons.
