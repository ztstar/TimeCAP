Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which coincided with the formation of fog and near-zero visibility in some areas. A notable wind event occurred in the early morning, driven by strong southwest to west winds, likely due to a coastal low-pressure system interacting with the marine layer. Air pressure fluctuated throughout the day, with dips indicating dynamic atmospheric changes, particularly around the time of peak wind activity. These conditions suggest a persistent marine layer influence, with potential for foggy mornings and variable wind patterns continuing into the next 24 hours.
