Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight hours, indicating significant moisture accumulation, likely contributing to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds surged in the morning hours before calming significantly by midday, with a shift toward more westerly and northerly wind directions, consistent with coastal flow dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a typical marine layer event, where cool, moist air is trapped near the surface, resulting in overcast skies and potentially chilly, foggy conditions in the city.
