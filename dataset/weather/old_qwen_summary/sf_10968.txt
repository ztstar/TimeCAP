Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure showed a general decline toward the end of the period, particularly in the final few hours, signaling a possible approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to calm, with notable shifts in wind direction—especially a sharp change toward the northeast and east during the late night and early morning—indicative of a change in local flow patterns, possibly due to a sea breeze reversal or frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a dynamic transition in the local weather, with potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
