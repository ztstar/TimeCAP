Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before declining sharply as temperatures increased, suggesting a transition from a stable, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight but showed a notable drop in the late afternoon, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the period, with a marked shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast and then to the east-southeast in the late evening, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric flow. These patterns suggest a transition in weather conditions that could lead to increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day, particularly if the low-pressure influence strengthens.
