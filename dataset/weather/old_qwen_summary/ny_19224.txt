Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing warming trend. Humidity levels remained high in the early period, dropped significantly during midday, and then fluctuated, suggesting a period of dry air intrusion before returning to more moderate levels. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend through the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which typically signals the approach of stable, fair weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early evening, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds from the west and northwest, possibly indicating a change in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, increasing temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearer skies and more settled conditions later tonight and into the next day.
