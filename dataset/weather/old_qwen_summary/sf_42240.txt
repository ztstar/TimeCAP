Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. A sharp increase in humidity, reaching saturation levels in the early hours, suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s marine layer characteristics. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight rise toward midday, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning but increased notably in the late morning and afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to more southerly, potentially signaling a change in airflow patterns. These conditions together point to a typical coastal weather cycle, with marine influence dominating, likely contributing to a cool, foggy morning and a gradual clearing later in the day.
