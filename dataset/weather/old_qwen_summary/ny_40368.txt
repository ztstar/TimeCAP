Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting overnight moisture accumulation, which then decreased as temperatures rose and air became drier. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a gradual decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds intensified toward the evening, particularly in the final hours, accompanied by fluctuating wind directions, hinting at a developing or passing weather system. These combined trends suggest the approach of a dynamic weather front, potentially bringing changes such as precipitation or cloud cover in the coming hours.
