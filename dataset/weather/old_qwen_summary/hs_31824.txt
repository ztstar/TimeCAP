Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely began in the early morning and intensified through the afternoon. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning and late evening, suggesting saturated air conditions favorable for fog or dew formation, but declined significantly during the midday, reflecting drier air aloft. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before showing a slight decline, signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light during the early and late hours, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic air mass interactions. These combined trends point to a transition from a moist, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more variable daytime pattern, potentially reducing the risk of precipitation but increasing heat retention.
