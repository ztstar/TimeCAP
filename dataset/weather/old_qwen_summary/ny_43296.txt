Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced overnight cooling trend was followed by a steady daytime warming, indicating a significant diurnal temperature swing. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning period before sharply declining through the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and drying air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased notably in the morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, with gusts from the northwest and west, possibly indicating the influence of a passing frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from west-northwest to northeast in the afternoon further supports the arrival of a more stable, drier air mass, consistent with improving weather conditions in the city.
