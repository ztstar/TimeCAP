Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing into the early afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, suggesting the potential for fog formation or light precipitation during this period. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase, particularly in the early morning hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to a more easterly flow, implying a change in airflow patterns that may influence local cloud development. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and high humidity points to a transition toward calm and potentially overcast or foggy conditions in the morning hours.
