Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and maritime air masses. Humidity levels reached saturation in the pre-dawn and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of dense fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight decline in the late evening, hinting at possible changes in atmospheric stability or the approach of a weak weather system. Wind patterns shifted from a southwesterly to a more southerly direction during the night, then veered toward the west-southwest in the early morning, consistent with offshore flow that can disperse fog and increase visibility. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a foggy, marine-influenced environment toward clearer, slightly warmer conditions as the day progressed.
