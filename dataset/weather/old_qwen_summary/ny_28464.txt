Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in temperature was observed, indicating a prolonged cold trend, likely due to sustained northerly air inflow. Humidity levels spiked to near saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which may have reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure fluctuated, with a notable rise followed by a gradual drop, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased significantly during mid-to-late night, particularly from the west and southwest, indicating intensified atmospheric instability and possible storm development. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and then back to westerly suggests a dynamic change in air mass, potentially leading to precipitation or worsening conditions in the coming hours.
