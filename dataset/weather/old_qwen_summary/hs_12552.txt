Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the upper 80s to low 90s, indicating a high moisture content in the air that could support fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours but intensified in the mid-morning, shifting from easterly to northerly and southerly directions, suggesting a change in air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment toward a drier, more stable daytime regime, with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
