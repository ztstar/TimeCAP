Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sustained drop in the mid-to-late night, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought increased cloud cover and the potential for light precipitation. Wind speeds were variable, with strong gusts in the early hours, predominantly from the west and northwest, aligning with typical coastal wind patterns, while winds diminished significantly in the late evening. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the final hours may signal a change in airflow, potentially indicating the approach of a new weather pattern, possibly bringing clearer skies and drier conditions.
