Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling and inland heating. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with high values during the night and early morning, likely due to fog development, followed by a significant drop in the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and drying conditions. Air pressure exhibited a generally stable yet fluctuating pattern, with a notable rise during the early morning and a peak in the mid-afternoon, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing and drying trend. Wind patterns were variable, with stronger gusts in the early morning and late evening, particularly from the west and north, consistent with marine layer dynamics and the onset of onshore flow. The combination of cooling overnight, drying in the afternoon, and shifting wind directions suggests a transition from a foggy, cool maritime environment to a warmer, clearer, and more stable daytime regime.
