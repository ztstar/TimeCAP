Over the past 20 market days, equity markets showed a generally upward trend with notable resilience despite periodic volatility, particularly in the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, which exhibited strong momentum in the latter half of the period. The VIX displayed a pronounced spike mid-period followed by a sustained decline, indicating a shift from heightened fear to improved market confidence. Commodity prices, especially crude oil and gold, demonstrated upward trajectories, suggesting strong demand and safe-haven interest, while the Nikkei 225 showed a mixed pattern with a sharp drop toward the end, reflecting regional market stress. Currency movements revealed a weakening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen, while the Chinese yuan remained stable, pointing to shifting global monetary dynamics and potential policy divergence. Collectively, the data reflect a complex but broadly positive macroeconomic environment, with growing risk appetite and inflationary pressures that may influence future central bank policy decisions.
