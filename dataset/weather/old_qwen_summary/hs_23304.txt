Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of high humidity, with values near or at saturation for much of the day, indicating a moist and oppressive air mass. Temperatures showed a slight cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming, suggesting the influence of diurnal heating patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a brief rise during midday hints at a possible weak high-pressure influence, though not strong enough to disrupt the moist conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest a change in local circulation, possibly due to developing convection or a weak boundary interaction. Combined, these factors point to a high likelihood of thunderstorm development, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours, due to the combination of instability, moisture, and increasing wind shear.
