A significant temperature drop occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon, indicating a marked diurnal shift. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, remaining elevated through mid-morning before declining as temperatures increased, suggesting moisture accumulation and subsequent stabilization. Air pressure remained relatively stable overnight but dropped sharply in the early afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to the influence of a developing frontal system, potentially bringing unstable conditions and the risk of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
