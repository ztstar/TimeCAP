Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture that may have contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies. Wind speeds were consistently low until late afternoon, when they increased notably, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast, signaling a potential change in weather patterns. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and changing wind direction suggests a possible shift toward more coastal influence, potentially bringing cooler, foggy conditions in the coming hours.
