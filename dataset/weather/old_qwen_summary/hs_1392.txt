Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal boundary or a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, only to begin a notable decline in the late afternoon, signaling potential approaching instability or storm development. Wind speeds remained low overnight, increasing during the day with a shift in wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, consistent with a developing low-pressure system. These combined patterns—rising humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind flow—point to an increased likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day or overnight.
