Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained largely stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a weak high-pressure system that may have helped clear some of the overnight fog. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the period, with a notable calm during the early morning hours, though a brief increase in the evening may signal shifting air flow patterns. The shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northerly and easterly in the late night and early morning suggests a change in local circulation, possibly linked to coastal upwelling or a developing onshore breeze.
