Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass, likely associated with overnight condensation or shallow convection. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern with a notable peak in the early morning, followed by a decline and stabilization, hinting at the passage of a weather front or localized low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching moderate levels, and winds shifted from southerly to more easterly and then westerly directions, indicating changing atmospheric circulation. These combined factors—high moisture, shifting wind patterns, and pressure changes—suggest the potential for thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly if instability continues to build.
