Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, with near-saturation conditions observed, raising the potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. The wind shift from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly directions aligns with the development of a moist, unstable air mass typical of Gulf weather patterns. These conditions collectively point to an increased risk of thunderstorms later in the day, especially given the combination of high moisture, weakening stability, and dynamic wind shifts.
