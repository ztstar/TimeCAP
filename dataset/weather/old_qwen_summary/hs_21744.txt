Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels dropped sharply overnight, reaching their lowest point just before sunrise, then gradually increased, suggesting the influence of daytime evaporation and potential moisture influx. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, peaking in the early evening before a slight decline, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that may bring clear skies. Wind speeds decreased during the night, reaching a minimum around dawn, then increased in the afternoon, accompanying a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, which may indicate a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a cooler, drier nocturnal regime to a warmer, more humid daytime atmosphere under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
