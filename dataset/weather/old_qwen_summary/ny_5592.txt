Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a passing frontal system. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, followed by a slow decline, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early hours, with gusts reaching higher intensities, particularly from the southeast and east, aligning with the movement of moisture-laden air. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by cooling, increasing moisture, and strengthening winds, potentially preceding precipitation or overcast conditions in the coming hours.
