Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a shift from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, remaining elevated for much of the night before declining slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a period of moisture accumulation likely linked to a passing frontal system. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the afternoon, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night, with gusts from the west and northwest, then diminished in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the data indicates a transition through a weather front that brought cooler, damper conditions overnight, with clearing skies and improving conditions expected as the system moves eastward.
