Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the overnight hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating the presence of a thick fog layer that dissipated with daytime heating. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system likely associated with changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, driven by a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, which may contribute to fog formation and coastal cooling. These combined patterns suggest a transition phase in the local weather, with the potential for foggy mornings and variable conditions as the atmospheric system evolves.
