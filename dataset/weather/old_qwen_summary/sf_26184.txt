Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture accumulation. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with shifts in direction suggesting changing airflow patterns, particularly from the west and southwest during peak humidity. These conditions collectively point to a maritime influence with potential for fog development overnight, consistent with San Francisco’s typical coastal climate patterns.
