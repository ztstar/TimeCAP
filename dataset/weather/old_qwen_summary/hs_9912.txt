Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and declined significantly through the day, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a notable rise in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased through the evening and early night, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially bringing in moist air ahead of a developing weather pattern. The shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southeasterly suggests a change in air flow, which could contribute to increased cloud cover and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms.
