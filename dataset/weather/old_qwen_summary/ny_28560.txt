Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold overnight period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or moist conditions during the night. Air pressure steadily rose through the evening and into the morning, peaking in the late morning and indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate to strong during the night and early morning, shifting direction from northwest to southwest and then back to northwest later, signaling changing wind patterns possibly tied to a developing weather front. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and breezy night to a gradually warming and drier day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
