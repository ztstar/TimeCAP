Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels were elevated during the early hours, indicating a moist air mass, which then sharply declined during the afternoon as dry air moved in, likely due to a change in wind patterns. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the period, peaking in the late evening, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the overnight hours, with a shift in direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, suggesting a change in circulation that likely facilitated the influx of drier air. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, cooling night to a drier, more stable afternoon, with potential for clear skies and comfortable conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
