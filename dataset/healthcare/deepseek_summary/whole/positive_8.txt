Influenza activity has shown a sustained upward trend over the past 20 weeks, with sharp increases in both the number of specimens tested and the proportion testing positive, peaking in recent weeks. Influenza A has consistently driven the rise in positivity, contributing disproportionately to the overall increase, while Influenza B has also risen significantly but at a slightly lower rate. The positivity ratio reached its highest levels in the most recent weeks, indicating a widespread and intense respiratory virus circulation, particularly in the community setting. A notable decline in positivity has emerged in the last two weeks, suggesting a possible plateau or early sign of a downward trend, though levels remain well above seasonal baseline. The sustained high burden underscores the need for continued surveillance, enhanced public health messaging, and consideration of vaccination and antiviral strategies to mitigate further spread.
