Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to a heightened chance of dew formation or fog. A steady increase in air pressure from late evening onward indicates the approach of a high-pressure system, typically associated with improving and drier conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient that could signal changing weather patterns. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly suggests a transition in airflow, potentially bringing cooler, drier air into the region.
