Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of nocturnal radiative cooling and morning solar heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before a sharp decline in the late morning, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as the sun rose and temperatures increased. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, which preceded a significant wind surge, likely due to a passing weather system or pressure gradient shift. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the southwest and west, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns influenced by the marine layer. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic transition from a cool, moist, and calm coastal environment to a warmer, drier, and windier regime, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in the broader weather pattern.
