Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a shift from marine-influenced conditions to more typical daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. A steady increase in atmospheric pressure during the afternoon and evening points to the approach of a high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for stronger onshore flow. These combined trends suggest the end of a foggy, cool period and the beginning of a drier, more stable, and gradually warming phase in the city.
