Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise was observed during the afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of warming air masses. Humidity levels showed a pronounced dip during midday, followed by a sharp increase in the late night, indicating possible moisture influx or condensation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and overnight, with gusts from the southwest, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined trends point to a transition in weather patterns, potentially leading to unstable conditions or precipitation in the near term.
