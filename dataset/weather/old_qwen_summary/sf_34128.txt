Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent break-up. Air pressure remained consistently high, with a slight increase during the midday hours, reflecting stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable patterns, indicating changes in local circulation and potential onshore flow. These conditions collectively suggest a typical foggy, cool coastal morning with clearing skies and mild temperatures later in the day, consistent with San Francisco’s microclimate.
