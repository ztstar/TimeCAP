Temperature showed a steady decline through the early hours, followed by a significant rise in the afternoon, indicating a developing warm front. Humidity remained relatively high during the night and early morning, dropping sharply during the afternoon as temperatures increased, suggesting the influence of drier air. Air pressure experienced a notable spike midday, followed by a return to stable levels, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speed increased substantially in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined trends suggest a transition from cooler, humid conditions to warmer, drier weather, potentially leading to clearer skies and improved conditions in the coming hours.
