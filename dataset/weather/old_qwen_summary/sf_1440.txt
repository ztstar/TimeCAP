Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation in the early morning, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A steady drop in air pressure through the early morning hours suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, consistent with the development of overcast conditions and increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified during the night, particularly in the early hours, with strong southerly to southeasterly flows shifting to more westerly and southwesterly directions by mid-morning, indicating a change in synoptic-scale wind patterns. These combined factors point to a period of persistent fog, cool temperatures, and potentially unsettled weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic conditions during the transition between maritime and continental influences.
