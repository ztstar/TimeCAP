Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a marked dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels climbed sharply during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, then declined significantly through the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increasing temperatures and changing wind patterns. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before gradually recovering, which is typical of an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest and then to the northeast, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that may precede a shift in weather conditions. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward clearer and potentially cooler conditions later in the day.
