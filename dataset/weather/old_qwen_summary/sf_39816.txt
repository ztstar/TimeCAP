Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning and dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a consistent rise, particularly in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry weather. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with directional shifts indicating changing airflow patterns likely associated with coastal influences and the development of a sea breeze. These trends collectively point to a day transitioning from cool, moist conditions to warmer, drier air, typical of a coastal diurnal cycle with favorable weather expected in the near term.
