Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a humid, stable environment to a drier, more settled weather pattern, likely leading to improved conditions with reduced chances of precipitation.
