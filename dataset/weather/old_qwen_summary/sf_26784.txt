Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, culminating in a notable rise in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds were initially moderate, increasing during the overnight hours before diminishing substantially by midday, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a maritime-influenced, foggy night to a relatively stable, dry, and mild afternoon—typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
