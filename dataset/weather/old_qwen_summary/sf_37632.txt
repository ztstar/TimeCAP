Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in temperatures. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, which likely brought increased cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels rose sharply during this period, peaking at very high levels, suggesting the onset of fog or drizzle, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. Wind activity intensified overnight, with strong southerly and southeasterly flows, likely contributing to the advection of marine air and enhanced fog formation. The shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest in the late afternoon may signal a return to more stable conditions, with winds moderating and skies clearing slightly.
