Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, particularly during the pre-dawn hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which dissipated as temperatures rose and wind speeds increased. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a significant spike in the early morning hours, followed by a sustained period of moderate to high pressure, indicating possible stabilization of weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief periods of calm, while wind direction shifted from southwesterly to more easterly and northerly, reflecting changing air mass influences. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer environment toward a drier, clearer, and slightly warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate during transitional seasons.
