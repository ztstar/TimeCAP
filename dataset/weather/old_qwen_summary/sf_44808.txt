Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent atmospheric parameters indicate a prolonged period of atmospheric stability, likely due to a persistent high-pressure system influencing the region. Such stability typically suppresses cloud formation and precipitation, leading to clear skies and dry conditions. The steady southeasterly wind flow suggests a well-established wind pattern, possibly driven by the marine layer, which is common along the California coast. Overall, these conditions point to a calm and dry environment with minimal weather change expected in the near term.
