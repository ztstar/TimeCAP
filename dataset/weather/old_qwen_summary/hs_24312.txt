Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation before sharply declining in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a stable, moist environment to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure remained relatively high through the night and early morning, but dropped notably in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system change. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly and southeasterly winds during the night to more variable, including a strong westerly shift in the late afternoon, consistent with a developing frontal influence. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind speeds, and rapid drying suggests the potential for thunderstorm development later in the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.
