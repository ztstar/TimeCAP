Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Temperature trends showed a cooling phase through the night followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, consistent with diurnal variation under changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the day, indicating a transition from moist to drier air. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, with a sudden change in direction from northerly to southerly and then to easterly, suggesting frontal passage or circulation changes. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing instability and potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
