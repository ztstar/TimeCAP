Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, especially during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog and low visibility, which likely contributed to the cooler perceived temperatures. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the latter half of the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring continued moist conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light but consistent, with a shift in wind direction from the northeast to the southeast, hinting at changes in the local atmospheric circulation. These conditions collectively suggest a stable marine layer with potential for continued fog and mild temperatures, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate during transitional periods.
