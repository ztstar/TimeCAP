Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly in the overnight period, indicating the influence of a moist air mass, which likely contributed to the formation of low-level clouds or fog. A sharp rise in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly, signaling a change in airflow that may bring warmer air into the region. These combined factors point to a transition from a cooler, damp night to a milder, drier, and more stable daytime regime, consistent with the approach of a high-pressure ridge.
