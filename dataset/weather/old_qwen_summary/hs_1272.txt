Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping, then rebounding in the late evening, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air masses and possible convective activity. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, but picked up dramatically in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. This combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and increasing wind suggests the potential for developing thunderstorms, particularly late in the period, with a possible risk of gusty winds and brief heavy rainfall.
