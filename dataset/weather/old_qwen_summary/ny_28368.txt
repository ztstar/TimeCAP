Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before stabilizing, indicating a prolonged cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting a drying trend, followed by a slight rebound in the late afternoon, which may indicate a shift in air mass or the onset of localized moisture inflow. Air pressure showed a consistent and marked rise, particularly during the late night and early morning, pointing to the influence of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry, and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate with notable variability, especially in the early morning, though they calmed during the early afternoon, possibly due to the strengthening high-pressure ridge. Wind direction underwent a significant shift in the early hours, transitioning from west-northwest to northeast and then to southeast, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation that could precede a shift in weather patterns, potentially influencing cloud development or precipitation risks later in the day.
