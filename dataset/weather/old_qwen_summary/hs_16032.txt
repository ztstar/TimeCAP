Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a distinct cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nocturnal temperature drop and a morning rebound, likely due to a shift in air mass. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a slight decline in the late afternoon, hinting at possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased during the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating changing wind patterns typical of a frontal passage. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the atmosphere that could lead to unsettled weather, including the potential for thunderstorms, particularly if moisture and lift continue to converge.
