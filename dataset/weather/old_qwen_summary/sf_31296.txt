Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking and remaining elevated, suggesting dense fog formation or prolonged marine layer persistence. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the mid-morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely contributed to the increased cloud cover and fog. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the predawn and early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with offshore flow and fog transport into the city. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and sustained winds points to a stable marine layer that has dominated the coastal atmosphere, likely resulting in cold, foggy conditions with limited sunshine.
