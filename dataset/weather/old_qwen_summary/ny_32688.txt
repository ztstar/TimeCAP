Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decrease during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool overnight period into a milder daytime cycle. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which may have reduced visibility during those periods. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northeasterly and then toward the south, indicating changing airflow patterns possibly associated with a developing ridge. Overall, the data suggests improving weather conditions with decreasing moisture and increasing stability, likely leading to a clearer and more comfortable day ahead.
