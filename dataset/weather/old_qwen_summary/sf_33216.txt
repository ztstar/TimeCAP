Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable nocturnal period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog, a hallmark of the city’s microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before increasing steadily in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight and remained light in the early morning, but began to strengthen again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest toward the west and then southeast, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a typical marine layer pattern, with fog and cool temperatures in the morning, followed by clearing and warming as the day progresses—consistent with San Francisco’s signature coastal weather cycle.
