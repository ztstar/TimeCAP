Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a significant overnight drop followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold night with a return to milder conditions during the day. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing skies. Wind speeds were strongest in the pre-dawn and midday hours, with consistent winds from the northwest to west sectors, suggesting a shift in airflow that may have transported cooler air into the region. Taken together, these trends point to a transition from a cold, foggy night to a gradually improving, clearer day under a strengthening high-pressure influence.
