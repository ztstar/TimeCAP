Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a notable cooling event likely tied to a passing front or nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during the same period, suggesting a shift to drier air, possibly due to descending air or a change in wind direction. Air pressure exhibited a brief but marked drop around the time of the temperature and humidity changes, consistent with a low-pressure system’s influence, which may have contributed to the instability. Wind speed increased substantially during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air mass and potential storm development. The combination of these factors suggests a transient weather system passed through the region, bringing cooler, drier conditions and potentially setting the stage for unstable weather later in the day.
