Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a warmer daytime pattern. Humidity levels surged during the overnight period, remaining elevated through early morning before rapidly declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moisture-laden air. Air pressure showed a sustained increase through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, which typically signals the approach of stable, fair weather conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight and increased slightly in the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating changing air mass influences. Together, these trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night into a drier, warmer day, with conditions favorable for clearing skies and improved comfort as the day progresses.
