Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon, which suggests the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the sun rose and temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system, though it stabilized afterward with fluctuating readings consistent with shifting local wind patterns. Wind speeds increased substantially in the final hours, particularly from the northwest and west, which may indicate the arrival of stronger offshore flow or a change in synoptic-scale conditions. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, foggy maritime environment toward a drier, windier, and slightly warmer regime, potentially marking the beginning of a more stable high-pressure period.
