Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp spike during the overnight hours and a marked drop during the midday, indicating a possible passing frontal system or localized thunderstorm activity. Air pressure dropped significantly in the early morning before rebounding, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system that likely brought the observed moisture and instability. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing synoptic-scale flow. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic weather pattern, potentially increasing the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day as warmth and moisture reaccumulate.
