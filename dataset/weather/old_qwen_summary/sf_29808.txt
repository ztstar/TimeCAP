Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily dropping through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, which later gave way to a significant drying trend as winds increased. Air pressure rose steadily through the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around midday, with a marked increase in speed and a change in direction from westerly to southerly, potentially signaling the arrival of a coastal wind surge or changes in synoptic flow. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer regime to a drier, more variable, and potentially windier environment in the coming hours.
