Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose substantially overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon as temperatures increased, suggesting a possible clearing or drying trend. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the possible influence of a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with the approach of a developing storm or frontal boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions and fluctuating humidity, these changes suggest an unstable atmospheric environment, raising the likelihood of thunderstorms or localized heavy precipitation in the near term.
