Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight hours, dropping sharply during midday before rebounding in the evening, suggesting the influence of marine layer dynamics and possible fog formation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before a sharp decline in the afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a low-pressure system or changing weather front. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the early morning hours, driven by strong westerly and southerly winds, likely due to pressure gradients associated with coastal upwelling or storm systems. The shift in wind direction from west to north and then to northeast in the late afternoon indicates a potential change in synoptic conditions, possibly bringing cooler, drier air and influencing visibility and local wind patterns.
