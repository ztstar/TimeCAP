Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures decreasing through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly. Humidity remained consistently high, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to persistent fog or mist, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds rose during the night and early morning, maintaining moderate strength before tapering off, with winds consistently originating from the northwest quadrant—indicating a shift in airflow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined factors point to the arrival of a stable, dry air mass, likely signaling the end of any recent moisture-laden conditions and a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions.
