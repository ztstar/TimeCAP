Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon and evening, indicating a nighttime cooling trend possibly due to clear skies or low cloud cover. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely associated with a change in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before stabilizing, which is indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the region, typically bringing stable and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally low at night, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction pointing to changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to the approaching high-pressure influence. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting winds suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition to clearer skies and more settled weather in the coming hours.
