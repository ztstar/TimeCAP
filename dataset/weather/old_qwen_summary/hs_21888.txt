Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moist air masses and possible overnight condensation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase toward midday, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable conditions, potentially reducing the risk of thunderstorms, though residual moisture may still support isolated showers later in the day.
