Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with marine layer conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a partial recovery, indicating the passage of a weather system, possibly a frontal boundary. Wind speeds remained low throughout most of the night, with a brief increase in the afternoon, and wind directions shifted from westerly to southerly, signaling a change in airflow likely tied to the system's movement. These conditions collectively suggest a coastal fog event influenced by marine air, with a transition toward clearer skies and warmer temperatures as the system moved eastward.
