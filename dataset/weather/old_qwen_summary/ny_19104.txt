Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning, indicating a significant cooling trend, followed by a gradual recovery as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking during the night, before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend through the night, reaching a peak in the late morning, which is indicative of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with sustained strong winds from a consistent northerly direction, likely enhancing cooling and dispersing any lingering moisture. The combination of falling temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strong northerly winds points to the arrival of a cold front, leading to crisp, dry conditions and potentially clearer skies in the near term.
