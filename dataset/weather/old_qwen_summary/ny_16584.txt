Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise overnight, suggesting high-pressure influence that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind patterns shifted from light easterly flow to stronger, more variable winds in the afternoon, with a notable change in direction from westward to southerly, possibly signaling an approaching front. These combined indicators suggest the passage of a nocturnal cooling event followed by the onset of a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improving conditions for the remainder of the day.
