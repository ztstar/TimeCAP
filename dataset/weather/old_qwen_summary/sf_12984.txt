Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as the sun heated the surface. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate in the early morning, with stronger gusts from the southwest during the night, transitioning to lighter, more variable winds in the afternoon as the pressure gradient weakened. The shift in wind direction from southwest to more westerly and then to northwest suggests a change in airflow patterns, which may signal the approach of a new weather system or the clearing effect of a high-pressure ridge.
