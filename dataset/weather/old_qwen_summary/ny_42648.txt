Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooldown occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping and fluctuating through the day, indicating a shift in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight increase during midday, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely brought clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were low and consistent through the night, but increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a significant shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, signaling a potential change in air mass. This combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and southerly winds suggests a transition toward more humid and potentially unstable conditions, possibly setting the stage for afternoon thunderstorms.
