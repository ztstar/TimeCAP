Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling phase. Humidity reached and maintained saturation levels during the early hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure showed a consistent and significant upward trend, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry, and clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished notably in the afternoon, coinciding with a shift toward more northerly wind directions, which may reflect a weakening of frontal influence and increased atmospheric stability. Overall, the data point to a transition into a colder, drier, and more settled weather regime, likely resulting in crisp, clear conditions for the remainder of the day and into the next.
