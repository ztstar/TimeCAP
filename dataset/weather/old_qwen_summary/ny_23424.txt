Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to the city. Temperature trends show a significant cooling during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from cooler, stable conditions to a more unstable, warming phase. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking in the morning before dropping significantly in the afternoon, which may signal the passage of a frontal boundary. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more easterly and then southeasterly direction, consistent with the development of a cyclonic circulation around the low-pressure center. Combined with the falling pressure and changing wind flow, these indicators suggest an increased likelihood of precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
