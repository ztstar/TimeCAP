Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late night and early morning before slightly declining, indicating persistent moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting a possible change in atmospheric stability or the approach of a weather system. Wind activity was minimal overnight, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the late afternoon and early evening, likely associated with shifting local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a developing marine influence, with potential for fog or low clouds, particularly near coastal areas, as the evening progressed.
