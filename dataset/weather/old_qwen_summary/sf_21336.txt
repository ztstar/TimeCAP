Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cooling trend typical of coastal marine influence. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of significant weather system movement through the region. Wind speed remained low and consistent until the final hour, when it increased slightly, possibly signaling a shift in local circulation patterns. Wind direction shifted significantly from southwesterly to more southerly and then westerly, indicating evolving flow patterns that could influence coastal fog dissipation or the arrival of a new air mass.
