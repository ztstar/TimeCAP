Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, remaining elevated through the early morning before fluctuating, suggesting the influence of marine air masses and potential fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, which may have signaled the approach of a low-pressure system or shifting weather front. Wind speeds were generally moderate during the day, with a marked reduction in the early morning hours, while wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to southerly and then easterly, hinting at a complex interaction of local topography and synoptic-scale patterns. These combined factors suggest a dynamic transition period, potentially leading to increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term.
