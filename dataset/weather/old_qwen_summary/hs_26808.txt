Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation and increased discomfort during cooler periods. A gradual drop in air pressure was observed, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling possible approaching unsettled weather or storm systems. Wind speeds increased slightly during the evening and early night, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, consistent with changing air mass dynamics. These combined indicators point to an evolving atmospheric condition that may lead to precipitation or thunderstorm activity in the near term.
