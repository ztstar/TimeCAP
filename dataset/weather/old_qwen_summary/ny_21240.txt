Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery during the afternoon, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity levels dropped sharply in the early hours, reaching a low mid-morning before rising again in the evening, suggesting a dry air mass during the night and possible moisture influx later. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, peaking in the early hours before a slight decline, which may signal the arrival of a high-pressure system influencing stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the night, particularly in the early hours, before calming dramatically in the late morning and early afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more southerly and then easterly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition from a cold, dry, and stable overnight regime to a milder, more variable daytime pattern, with potential for clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
