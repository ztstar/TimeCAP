Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming during the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining through the day, suggesting increased moisture availability that may contribute to afternoon cloud development or showers. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate but increased during the night and early morning, with a shift toward more southerly to easterly directions, which may facilitate the transport of moist air into the region. Combined, these trends point to a developing weather pattern conducive to afternoon convection and potential thunderstorms, especially if daytime heating intensifies.
