Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere. Temperature trends revealed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting a stable marine layer influence. Air pressure fluctuated with a notable rise during the early morning hours, followed by a steady decline, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather pattern. Wind speeds increased modestly during the evening and overnight, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, hinting at changing synoptic conditions. The combination of high humidity, stable temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests a high likelihood of fog or low clouds persisting into the early part of the next day.
