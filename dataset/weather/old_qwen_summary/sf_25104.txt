Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours and decreasing during midday, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion and potential fog development. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong southerly to westerly flows, possibly enhancing coastal fog formation. The shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest in the late afternoon suggests a transition in air mass, potentially signaling the onset of a drier and more stable regime.
