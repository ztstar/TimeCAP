Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of nocturnal moisture and the influence of drying air masses. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable increase in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were light to moderate throughout most of the day, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and eventually to a more northerly flow, indicating changing synoptic patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, warming afternoon, likely leading to partly cloudy to clear conditions in the coming hours.
