Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually warming slightly toward the end of the period. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike in the early morning followed by a sharp drop during midday, indicating a shift from moist to drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind activity remained light overall, with brief bursts of moderate wind, primarily from the west and southwest, which may have contributed to localized fog dissipation and air mixing. These trends collectively point to a transition from a cooler, more humid night into a drier, clearer morning, consistent with typical coastal weather patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics.
