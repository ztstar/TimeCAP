Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nocturnal temperature drop and a return to warmer daytime conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, reaching saturation and persisting near 100% for several hours, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a significant spike during the early morning, followed by a return to near-normal levels, hinting at the passage of a transient weather system. Wind patterns shifted from moderate southerly to stronger westerly and then northerly directions, with increasing speeds through the afternoon, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting winds indicates a transition period likely associated with an approaching frontal system, increasing the risk of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
