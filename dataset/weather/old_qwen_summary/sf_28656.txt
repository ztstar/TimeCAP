Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced spike in the early hours, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere, which likely contributed to fog formation, particularly during the night. Air pressure exhibited a significant drop in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable rise in wind speed and shifting wind direction, suggesting the arrival of a developing weather system. The sustained southerly to easterly wind flow during the early period gave way to more variable and stronger winds later, consistent with frontal passage. These changes collectively point to the approach of a low-pressure system, increasing the likelihood of overcast skies, cooler conditions, and potential light precipitation in the coming hours.
