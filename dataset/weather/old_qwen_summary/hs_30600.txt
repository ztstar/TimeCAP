Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend that likely contributed to increased atmospheric instability. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which enhances the feeling of mugginess and increases the potential for precipitation. Air pressure showed a notable decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring storms. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to an elevated risk of thunderstorms, especially during the overnight hours, with possible impacts on local travel and outdoor activities.
