Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure remained stable through the night and early morning, then declined slightly in the late afternoon, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were strongest in the early evening, decreasing through the night and morning, with gusts originating from the northwest, followed by a shift to more variable and weaker winds in the afternoon. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and a drop in pressure indicates the possible arrival of a changeable weather pattern, possibly bringing clouds or precipitation later in the day.
