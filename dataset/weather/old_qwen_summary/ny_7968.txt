Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery during the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooler night and warming trend as daylight returned. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning hours, dropping significantly in the midday and stabilizing at lower levels, suggesting a drying trend after overnight moisture accumulation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northeast, likely due to strengthening gradient forces associated with the high-pressure buildup. Combined, these trends point to a transition from a damp, cool overnight period to a drier, more stable, and gradually warming day, consistent with the arrival of fair weather conditions.
