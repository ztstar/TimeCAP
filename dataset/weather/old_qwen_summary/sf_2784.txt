Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning and sustaining near 87% for much of the night, indicating a moist and stable air mass. Air pressure showed a notable rise, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with a significant increase in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and then southerly, suggesting changing flow patterns. These trends collectively suggest the end of a cool, foggy period and the beginning of a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer regime, consistent with the typical afternoon clearing seen in coastal San Francisco.
