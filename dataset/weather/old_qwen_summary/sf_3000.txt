Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or a clearing trend. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a notable drop toward the end of the period, indicating possible approaching weather changes. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a consistent northerly to westerly component early on, shifting to more variable directions later, including a brief easterly component in the late evening. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a coastal marine layer that was dense and stable overnight, breaking down during the afternoon, potentially leading to clearer skies and milder conditions in the coming hours.
