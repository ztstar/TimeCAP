Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually warming in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a cooling period followed by stabilization. Humidity levels remained relatively high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the afternoon, which may indicate clearing skies and improved air circulation. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speed intensified significantly in the afternoon, peaking in the evening, with wind direction shifting from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with a developing northerly flow. Taken together, these patterns suggest a transition toward clearer, drier, and cooler conditions, with increasing windiness likely to persist into the coming day.
