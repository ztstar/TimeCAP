Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking in the hours just before sunrise, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical for the region during marine layer events. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sustained period of low pressure, suggesting the influence of a developing or passing weather system, possibly associated with a coastal front. Wind speeds were strongest during the night, with a shift to stronger, more variable winds in the early morning, followed by a marked decrease during midday, which coincided with the development of the marine layer. The wind direction transitioned from westerly to more southerly and easterly, indicating a complex interaction between coastal winds and regional pressure gradients, which may influence the stability and duration of fog and low clouds.
