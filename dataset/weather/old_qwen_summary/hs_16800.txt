Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating a moist air mass likely influenced by nearby Gulf moisture. Air pressure showed a sustained rise, particularly from midday onward, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day, with a notable increase in the final hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing air flow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially reducing the risk of thunderstorms but also possibly trapping pollutants near the surface.
