Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours, indicating a saturated air mass, which then decreased significantly as the day progressed, suggesting a drying trend. Air pressure showed a slight increase in the middle of the day followed by minor fluctuations, hinting at a stable but evolving atmospheric condition. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout, with a subtle shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southeast in the afternoon, possibly signaling a change in air mass movement. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for clearing skies and improved comfort conditions later in the day.
