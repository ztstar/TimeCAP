Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high in the early period, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding late in the cycle, suggesting a shift in moisture content likely tied to changing air masses. Air pressure steadily increased through the early and midday hours, peaking in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the afternoon and evening, particularly in the final hours, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest to west, consistent with offshore flow conditions. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, more stable, and windy regime—typical of a coastal clearing pattern following a period of fog and low clouds.
