Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in air pressure, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with changing and potentially stormy weather. Temperature trends revealed a cooling pattern overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, suggesting a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels fluctuated widely, peaking during early morning hours and decreasing through the day, consistent with fog formation at night and dissipation during daylight. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west and southwest, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation likely linked to the low-pressure system. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more unstable and potentially rainy conditions in the near term.
