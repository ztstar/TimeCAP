Temperatures exhibited a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by overnight radiative cooling. Humidity levels increased significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to reduced mixing and near-surface condensation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a brief rise in the late morning followed by a slight drop, hinting at minimal large-scale weather system influence. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or local circulation. These patterns collectively suggest a transition toward more humid and potentially unstable conditions, which could elevate the risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
