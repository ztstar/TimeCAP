Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the morning, with winds shifting from a southwestern to a more west-southwesterly direction, consistent with a coastal wind pattern driven by the pressure gradient. These combined factors suggest improving conditions with reduced fog and increasing sunshine, favorable for outdoor activities later in the day.
