Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and into the evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the night, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure showed a steady decline toward the end of the period, indicating a possible approaching weather system, potentially associated with storm activity. Wind patterns shifted from variable to more consistent, with increasing speeds and a change in direction suggesting an evolving atmospheric circulation pattern. These conditions collectively suggest the onset of unstable weather, with a heightened risk of thunderstorms later in the day.
