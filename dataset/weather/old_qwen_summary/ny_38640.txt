Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, then dropped sharply during midday before rising again in the evening, suggesting the influence of changing air masses. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speed increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west to southeast, consistent with a developing frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, likely bringing unsettled skies and potential precipitation in the near term.
