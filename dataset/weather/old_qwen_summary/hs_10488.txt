Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperatures showed a gradual increase during the day, suggesting warming trends, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and early morning, reaching near saturation, which enhances the potential for fog or precipitation. Wind conditions remained consistently light and from the northeast throughout the period, suggesting limited air mass mixing and possible stagnation of moisture. Combined, these patterns point to a high likelihood of developing showers or thunderstorms later in the day, especially with the elevated humidity and weakening pressure.
