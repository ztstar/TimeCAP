Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Persistent high humidity levels, particularly during the early hours, suggest the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. A notable spike in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a sharp drop in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a weather front that may have brought changing conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated considerably, with strong gusts in the early and late hours, coupled with shifts in wind direction that reflect dynamic atmospheric changes, including possible onshore flow. These combined factors point to a transition period in the weather, likely involving fog dissipation and the approach of a more stable air mass.
