Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the morning, indicating a cold overnight period with a slight warming trend. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, spiked in the mid-morning, and then stabilized, suggesting the influence of changing air masses and possible localized moisture influx. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, then stabilized with minor fluctuations, pointing to a passing low-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds increased overnight, peaking in the early hours before diminishing, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to northeast, consistent with the movement of a frontal system. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, bringing cooler temperatures, variable winds, and potential for changing conditions later in the day.
