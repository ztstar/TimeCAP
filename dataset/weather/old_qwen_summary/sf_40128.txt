Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning, dropping significantly during midday before rising again in the evening, suggesting the presence of a low-level moisture layer that lifted and dissipated as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early night, peaking around midnight, followed by a steady decline through the morning hours, which may signal the approach of a weather system or shifting air mass. Wind speeds increased sharply in the early morning, driven by strong onshore flow, before subsiding to light and variable conditions by midday, with wind direction shifting from predominantly westerly to southerly and later northerly, reflecting changes in local synoptic conditions. These combined factors point to a transition from a stable, foggy marine layer to a more variable and potentially clearing pattern, with implications for visibility, temperature comfort, and wind exposure across the region.
