Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the early morning hours and then declining, indicating a shift from moist, marine-influenced air to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind patterns were highly variable, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest during the night, followed by calmer conditions in the afternoon, particularly from the south and east. These combined factors suggest a transition from a foggy, cool marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, which may lead to improved visibility and warmer daytime conditions in the coming hours.
