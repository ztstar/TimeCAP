Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight followed by a steady warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight low. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a possible frontal passage or moisture influx. Air pressure remained stable at a high level throughout the period, signaling persistent fair weather and the absence of an approaching storm system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the west and northwest, which may indicate changing air mass influences. Overall, the data points to a transition from a cool, moist morning to a warmer, drier afternoon, with stable atmospheric conditions expected to persist.
