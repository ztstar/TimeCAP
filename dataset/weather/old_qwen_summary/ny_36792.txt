Temperature trends show a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of winter conditions. Humidity spiked during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, followed by a significant drop during the midday, which likely improved visibility and comfort. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, which may have contributed to the mixing of air layers and the dispersal of moisture. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and moderate winds suggests improving conditions with a likelihood of clearer skies and a drying trend in the coming hours.
