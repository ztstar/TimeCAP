Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a substantial warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cool night to a milder day. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then dropped sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the clearing of moist air and the arrival of drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, signaling the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were light and variable during the night, increasing notably in the afternoon, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, which likely contributed to the warming trend. The shift in wind direction and the combination of rising temperature and falling humidity point to a dry, stable air mass taking over, likely resulting in clear skies and favorable conditions for the remainder of the day.
