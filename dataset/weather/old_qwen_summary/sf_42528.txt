Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooldown during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a strong marine influence, with persistent fog and low visibility likely. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred mid-morning, with increased wind speeds and a change in direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, suggesting a dynamic shift in air mass movement. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor dip late in the period, which may have preceded or coincided with the arrival of a weak frontal influence. Overall, the combination of high humidity, variable winds, and cooling temperatures points to a typical coastal fog event with potential for lingering damp conditions into the early hours of the next day.
