Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, reaching saturation in the early hours before steadily declining, indicating a period of condensation and possible fog formation. Air pressure remained stable through the night, then increased notably in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and later to more westerly, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, likely resulting in improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation in the near term.
