Temperature trends show a steady decline through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery during the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle with a cold nocturnal period. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning a modest decline, suggesting increasing moisture availability that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then exhibited a marked decrease in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, consistent with the development of a frontal system moving through the region. These combined factors suggest a transition to potentially unstable conditions, with increased chances of precipitation and cooler temperatures later in the day.
