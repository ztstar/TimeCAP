Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the night and early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply during the same period, peaking at very high levels, which suggests the presence of moist air and the potential for fog or low clouds in the early morning. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop, signaling the passage of a weather front that may have brought precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning hours, with strong gusts from the northwest and later from the northeast, consistent with a developing storm system. Combined, these indicators point to the influence of a cold front moving through the area, which could result in showers or thunderstorms and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
