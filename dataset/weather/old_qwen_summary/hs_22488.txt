Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly, reaching saturation in the early morning, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or dew formation and contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, signaling the approach of a more stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate and generally consistent, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then to westerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These patterns together suggest the influence of a developing frontal system, potentially leading to scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
