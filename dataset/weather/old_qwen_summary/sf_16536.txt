Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly overnight before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn before slowly decreasing, indicating a period of high moisture content likely associated with fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, consistent with the influence of marine air intrusion. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal pattern, where cool, moist air moves in from the Pacific, contributing to foggy mornings and mild daytime temperatures.
