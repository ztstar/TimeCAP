Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle, with temperatures dropping through the night and rising sharply during the afternoon, indicating strong solar heating under clear skies. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and remained elevated into the midday before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable boundary layer to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily declined through the afternoon and evening, reaching a low point just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with near-still conditions during the night, but increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to developing surface heating and pressure gradients. The wind direction showed a shift from southeast to variable and then to more southerly/southwesterly in the evening, hinting at potential inflow from the Gulf of Mexico, which could contribute to increased moisture and instability later in the day.
