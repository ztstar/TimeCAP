Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature swing likely driven by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of a dense fog or low cloud cover typical of coastal conditions. A notable increase in air pressure during the early morning hours coincided with the peak in humidity, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere and contributed to the fog formation. Wind speeds diminished during the night and early morning, with light and variable winds, followed by a shift in wind direction toward the east and southeast in the late afternoon, potentially indicating the onset of a sea breeze. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with nighttime cooling, fog development, and a gradual clearing as the pressure system strengthens and winds begin to shift, likely improving visibility and conditions in the coming hours.
