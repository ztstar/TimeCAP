Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and early morning, with a notable surge in the early hours, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that has since stabilized. Wind speeds remained low and consistent throughout the day, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and then to the west during the afternoon, possibly indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and stable air mass to drier, more settled conditions, likely resulting in clear or partly cloudy skies in the coming hours.
