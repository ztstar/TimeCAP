Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating strong diurnal temperature variation typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a sharp rise later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather front or atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased substantially in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore, potentially signaling an influx of marine air. These combined patterns point to a transition period marked by fog, cooling, and the arrival of a more dynamic air mass, which may lead to continued overcast conditions and a potential for light drizzle in the coming hours.
