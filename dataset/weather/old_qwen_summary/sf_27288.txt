Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility in the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind speeds remained light through the night, but increased substantially in the afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to southwest, consistent with a sea breeze developing. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and changing wind patterns points to a coastal fog event that likely dissipated during the afternoon as winds strengthened and temperatures rose.
