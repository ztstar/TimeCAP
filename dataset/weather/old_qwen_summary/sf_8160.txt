Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and into the early morning, peaking dramatically before declining sharply as the day progressed, indicating a significant shift in air mass. Air pressure increased significantly during the early morning, suggesting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with near-zero winds in the predawn hours, but picked up in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These changes point to a transition from maritime inflow to a more settled, possibly fog-prone regime, consistent with San Francisco’s coastal weather dynamics.
