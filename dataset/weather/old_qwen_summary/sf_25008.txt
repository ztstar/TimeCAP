Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, suggesting fog formation or marine layer persistence, which then decreased during the afternoon as conditions cleared. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-afternoon, followed by a rebound later in the evening, signaling possible frontal passage or shifting atmospheric dynamics. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening, particularly from the west and northwest, consistent with the influence of coastal winds and potential upwelling. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and stable marine layer to a drier, windier, and more variable regime, likely driven by synoptic-scale changes affecting the Bay Area.
