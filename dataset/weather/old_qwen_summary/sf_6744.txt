Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, remaining near saturation through the early morning hours before dropping significantly in the afternoon, indicating a shift from foggy, moist conditions to clearer, drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing between midnight and 6 AM, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west-southwest, consistent with a shift in local wind patterns. These changes collectively point to a transition from a fog-prone, stable marine layer to a drier, more stable atmosphere, likely signaling improved visibility and a break in the typical coastal fog cycle.
