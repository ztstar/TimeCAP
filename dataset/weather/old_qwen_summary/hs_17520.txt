Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a slight回暖, with temperatures stabilizing after a period of sustained low values. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late evening and early morning, indicating a moist air mass that likely contributed to increased comfort levels and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a steady rise, particularly during the mid-to-late night, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased slightly in the overnight hours, shifting from a consistent southerly direction to a more easterly flow, which may signal a change in air mass dynamics. Overall, the data suggests a transition toward more stable and dry conditions, though lingering moisture could still support isolated showers, especially during early morning hours.
