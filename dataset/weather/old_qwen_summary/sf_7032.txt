Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, starting high and dropping sharply during midday before rising again in the evening, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier, more variable air. Air pressure fluctuated with a notable peak in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies. Wind speeds remained generally low throughout the day, with a brief increase in the late evening, while wind direction shifted from northwest to southeast, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. Overall, the pattern suggests a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog dissipation and a developing onshore flow, which may contribute to cooler conditions overnight and potential fog return in the early morning.
