Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from a cold nocturnal period to a milder daytime phase. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight and remained elevated, particularly in the late night and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, with a notable drop in the latter half of the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system likely associated with incoming precipitation. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal system. These combined factors indicate a dynamic and unsettled weather pattern, with a high likelihood of precipitation and cooler, windier conditions in the near term.
