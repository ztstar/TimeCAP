Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation in the early hours before gradually declining, suggesting conditions conducive to fog or dew formation during the coolest part of the night. A consistent pattern of high pressure prevailed throughout the period, contributing to stable atmospheric conditions and clear skies in the morning, with minimal cloud development. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and later to more variable patterns, potentially signaling changes in air mass influence. The combination of warming temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns in the evening suggests a transition toward more comfortable conditions, though residual moisture may lead to isolated early-morning showers.
