Temperature showed a gradual decline overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning before steadily rising through the day, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime air. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting possible dew formation, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, which may have contributed to clearer skies. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and dry weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly, signaling a change in air mass. Overall, the data points to a developing pattern of fair weather with improving conditions, likely resulting in pleasant daytime temperatures and reduced precipitation risk.
