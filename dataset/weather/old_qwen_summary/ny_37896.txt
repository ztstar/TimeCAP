Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before a gradual recovery. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained high readings during the night and early morning, followed by a notable drop during midday, suggesting a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were variable, with peak gusts occurring in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and west, potentially signaling a change in weather patterns. These indicators collectively suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid period to a drier and more stable phase, likely improving visibility and reducing the chance of precipitation.
