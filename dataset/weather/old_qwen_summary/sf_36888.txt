Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily dropping during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the likelihood of fog formation, which is typical in coastal areas during temperature inversions. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, reaching a sustained high, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the early evening, with strong southerly and westerly flows giving way to calmer conditions by morning, consistent with the land-sea breeze cycle and the transition into a more settled weather regime. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly in the afternoon points to a change in large-scale airflow, possibly signaling the arrival of a more stable air mass, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
