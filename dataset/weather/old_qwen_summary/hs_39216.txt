Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours, suggesting saturated air conditions that may have contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the early morning, which was followed by a slow recovery, hinting at the passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and south-southeast directions, potentially bringing in moist air and supporting convective activity. Combined with elevated humidity and fluctuating pressure, these conditions suggest a heightened risk of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
