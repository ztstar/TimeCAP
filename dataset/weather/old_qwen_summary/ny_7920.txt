Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Temperature trends show a cooling phase overnight, followed by a steady rise in the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a cooler, possibly stormy period to a warming trend. Humidity levels soared during the night and early morning, peaking just before the pressure minimum, which aligns with increased cloud cover and precipitation risk. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, particularly from the southwest and west, consistent with storm dynamics, before calming and shifting to lighter, more variable directions in the afternoon. The combination of these factors points to a recent weather disturbance—possibly a passing front or storm system—now giving way to improving conditions with a return to more stable, mild temperatures.
