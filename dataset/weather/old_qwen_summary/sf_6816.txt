Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-to-late night before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog and low clouds as the day warmed. Air pressure exhibited a gradual increase during the morning and midday hours, followed by a notable drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or frontal passage. Wind speeds were generally light during the early morning hours, with brief periods of stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to coastal influences. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and stable marine layer to a drier, more variable, and potentially unstable air mass, which could lead to clearer skies and more variable conditions in the coming hours.
