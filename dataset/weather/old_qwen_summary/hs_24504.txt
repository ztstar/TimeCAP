Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation before a sudden and dramatic decline in the mid-morning, suggesting a significant weather shift likely tied to a passing front. Air pressure exhibited a pattern of fluctuating lows and highs, with repeated drops below 1010 hPa, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability and possible storm activity. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning but increased substantially in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from varied directions, including a shift to more easterly and southerly flows later in the cycle. These combined trends point to the passage of a frontal system, which has likely brought brief precipitation and cooler conditions followed by clearing skies and a return to milder temperatures.
