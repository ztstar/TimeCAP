Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, followed by a gradual stabilization, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal heat loss and increasing moisture. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests high moisture content in the air and a strong potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained stable initially, then showed a consistent increase, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with a marked increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions, including southerly and easterly flows that may indicate a developing sea breeze or moisture influx. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering humidity and the possibility of isolated showers or thunderstorms if instability increases.
