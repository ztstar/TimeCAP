Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures steadily decreasing during the night and early morning hours before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly, peaking at near saturation, which is consistent with the development of fog and low-lying stratus clouds typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure continued to decline steadily throughout the period, indicating an approaching low-pressure system that may bring prolonged overcast conditions and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, suggesting a change in upper-level flow and possible onshore winds enhancing coastal moisture. Together, these indicators point to a persistent marine influence with high moisture content, reduced visibility, and a likely continuation of cool, foggy conditions in the coming hours.
