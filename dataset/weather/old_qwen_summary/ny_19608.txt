Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, beginning from a cold baseline and rising steadily through the day, indicating a warming trend likely due to changing air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early to mid-period, peaking in the night hours before dropping significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting possible clearing or a shift in air flow. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a sharp decline in the early morning followed by a recovery and a subsequent drop, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and potential for unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more westerly and then to a strong northerly direction toward the end of the period, which may signal the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors suggest a transition in weather conditions, with potential for precipitation or stormy weather in the near future.
