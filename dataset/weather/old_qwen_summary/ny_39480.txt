Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss and increasing cloud cover. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, contributing to a damp and chilly feel. A steady decline in air pressure, especially during the night, points to the approach of a low-pressure system, which is consistent with deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, signaling a change in air mass and potential for precipitation. These combined factors suggest that New York City experienced a transition toward unstable, wet weather, with strong potential for rain or drizzle, particularly in the morning hours.
