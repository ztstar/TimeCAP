Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during midday, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were highest in the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, likely associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. These combined patterns point to a transition from a moist, cooler night into a drier, more stable, and gradually warming day, favorable for improving visibility and reduced precipitation risk.
