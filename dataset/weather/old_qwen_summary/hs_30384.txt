Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool nocturnal period to a warming day. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, persisting at high levels before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing front or storm system. A notable and abrupt drop in air pressure in the early hours, followed by a rebound, points to the passage of a low-pressure system or storm front, which likely brought the increased humidity and wind activity. Wind speeds picked up during the evening and early morning, with a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, consistent with the shift in pressure systems and the potential for storm development. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind patterns indicates an unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the risk of thunderstorms or heavy precipitation in the near term.
