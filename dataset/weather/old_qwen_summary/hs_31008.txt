Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation multiple times, which suggests the presence of fog or mist during the early hours, likely due to nighttime radiative cooling. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a rise, signaling the passage of a weather front, possibly accompanied by precipitation. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift toward more easterly and southerly directions, indicating a change in air mass and potential for storm development. These combined conditions suggest a high likelihood of thunderstorm activity, particularly during the evening hours, with implications for localized flooding and reduced visibility.
