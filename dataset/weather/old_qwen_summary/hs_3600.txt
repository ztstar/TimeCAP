Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning, indicating increasing moisture in the air, which may contribute to fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overnight, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable, possibly signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, stable pressure, and strengthening winds suggests the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day if sufficient instability is present.
