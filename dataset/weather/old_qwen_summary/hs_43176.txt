Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front early in the period. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting condensation and potential fog or light precipitation, which later cleared as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a steady decline, signaling possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, then increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to northeast, consistent with a change in air mass. These combined indicators suggest post-frontal conditions with clearing skies and improving air quality, though increased wind late in the period may elevate dust or pollen dispersion.
