Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a milder daytime period. Humidity levels showed a marked contrast, with near-saturation conditions during the early morning, likely contributing to fog or mist, followed by a sharp decline and a return to moderate levels as the day progressed. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest and later to the west-northwest, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching high-pressure dominance. Overall, the data suggest improving weather conditions with reduced cloud cover and lower chances of precipitation, favorable for outdoor activities later in the day.
