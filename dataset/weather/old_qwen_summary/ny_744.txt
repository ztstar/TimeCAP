Temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a strong cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels sharply increased during the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to cooling air near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a brief drop in the early morning, followed by a return to higher values, signaling a passing weather system with minimal low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the period, with peak gusts in the late morning and early evening, and a notable shift in wind direction toward the west and southwest, potentially indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest the city experienced a transition from a moist, cool night to a drier, slightly warmer day, with winds shifting in response to evolving pressure gradients, possibly heralding a change in weather conditions.
