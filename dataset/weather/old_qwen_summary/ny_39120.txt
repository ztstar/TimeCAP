Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels surged to extreme values during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which likely reduced visibility and contributed to a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, culminating in a low reading by late evening, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the overnight hours, particularly around dawn, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable patterns, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined indicators point to a transition period in the weather, with potential for precipitation and deteriorating conditions in the near term.
