Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that persisted through the night and into early morning. Humidity remained near saturation for most of the period, with prolonged periods of 100%, suggesting high moisture content in the air and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stabilizing and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then to westerly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. This combination of cooling, high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting winds points toward a transition in weather, possibly leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions by late morning.
