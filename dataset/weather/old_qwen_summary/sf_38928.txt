Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal swing likely influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during midday, followed by a rebound in the evening, suggesting the influence of shifting air masses and possible fog dissipation. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before a sudden drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the arrival of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning hours, with strong southerly and westerly flows, then diminished to near calm conditions during the late night and early morning, aligning with typical marine layer behavior. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore in the late evening suggests a change in atmospheric circulation, potentially bringing moist air back into the region and increasing the likelihood of fog or low clouds later tonight.
