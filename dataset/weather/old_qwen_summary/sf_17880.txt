Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature patterns. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a slight decline, suggesting the possible approach of a weak weather system or a shift in airflow. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly, consistent with marine layer dynamics and onshore flow. These conditions point to a persistent marine influence, with fog and cool, damp air dominating the coastal environment, typical of San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
