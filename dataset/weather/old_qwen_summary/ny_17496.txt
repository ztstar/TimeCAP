Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably high values in the early morning and late evening, suggesting periods of moisture accumulation and possible fog formation. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, indicating the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were variable, with several bursts of stronger winds accompanied by shifting wind directions, particularly from the northeast and east, hinting at dynamic air mass interactions. These patterns collectively suggest a transition toward drier and more stable weather, though lingering moisture may contribute to early morning fog and cooler conditions.
