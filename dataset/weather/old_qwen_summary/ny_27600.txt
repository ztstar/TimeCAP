Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, followed by a recovery, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may have brought precipitation. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a drier, more dynamic one, potentially signaling clearing skies and improving conditions by the next day.
