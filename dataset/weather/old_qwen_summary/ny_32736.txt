Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation during the night. Air pressure exhibited a consistent downward trend, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the south and southeast, consistent with a developing frontal system drawing in moist, unstable air. Combined with sustained high humidity and falling pressure, these conditions point to a higher likelihood of precipitation in the near term, potentially affecting outdoor activities and travel.
