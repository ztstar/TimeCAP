Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, reaching saturation in the early morning, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the night and early morning. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, indicating a weakening high-pressure system and potential for incoming weather changes. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, suggesting a shift in atmospheric circulation that could bring more dynamic weather. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southwest to more variable and westerly patterns hints at possible changes in coastal upwelling or storm influence.
