Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in air pressure during the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that likely contributed to increased cloud cover and precipitation. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning, which coincided with the highest likelihood of fog and potential for thunderstorms. Temperature trends showed a gradual warming trend through the day, with a significant rise in the afternoon, suggesting a buildup of heat and energy in the atmosphere. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest, indicating the influence of a developing frontal boundary or storm system. These combined factors suggest an unstable atmospheric environment, increasing the risk of severe weather, including thunderstorms and heavy downpours, particularly in the coming hours.
