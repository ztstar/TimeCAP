Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the late night and early morning, suggesting moist air infiltration and potential for precipitation. Temperature gradually increased through the day, with a notable rise in the afternoon, reflecting a warming trend likely driven by a shift in air mass. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the period, with brief bursts of stronger winds and variable directions, including southerly and westerly shifts, which may have contributed to the transport of warm, moist air into the region. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern that could result in rain or stormy conditions later in the day.
