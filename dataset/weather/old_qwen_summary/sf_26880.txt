Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong overnight cooling phase likely driven by clear skies and low cloud cover. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking near dawn, suggesting the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture, which is typical of San Francisco’s microclimate. A notable decline in air pressure during the early hours, reaching a low point before a sharp rebound, signals the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and eventually northeast, indicating changing atmospheric circulation likely linked to the front’s influence. These conditions collectively point to a transition period marked by potential for fog, cooler temperatures, and unsettled weather, which may affect visibility, commute conditions, and outdoor activities across the city.
