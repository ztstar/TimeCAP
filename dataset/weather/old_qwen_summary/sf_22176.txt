Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily decreasing, suggesting the presence of marine fog that likely dissipated with increasing solar heating. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system to the north, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong, with a consistent flow from the northwest to west, aligning with prevailing onshore winds typical of the region’s marine layer. The shift in wind direction toward the west-southwest in the afternoon, combined with declining humidity and rising temperatures, signals the breakdown of the marine layer and the potential for clearer skies later in the day.
