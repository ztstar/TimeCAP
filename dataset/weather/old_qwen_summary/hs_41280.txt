Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more unstable air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend after a brief dip, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and fair weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to a developing surface boundary. These combined trends suggest the potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, moist air continues to accumulate under the prevailing high-pressure influence.
