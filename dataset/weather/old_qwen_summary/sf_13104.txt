Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon, indicating a shift in thermal patterns likely tied to changing air masses. Humidity levels showed a distinct diurnal cycle, with high values in the early morning and late night, dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the influence of coastal fog dissipation and sea breeze development. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then rose steadily during the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that would bring clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased noticeably in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, aligning with typical afternoon sea breeze dynamics. Wind direction shifted from offshore (southwest) in the morning to more onshore (northeast) during the afternoon, revealing a reversal consistent with the development of a coastal thermal low, which may contribute to the persistence of fog and cooler conditions into the evening.
