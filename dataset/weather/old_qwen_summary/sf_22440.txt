Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady rise in humidity, peaking near saturation levels during the early morning hours before gradually declining. Temperature remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations indicating a consistent maritime influence, typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in direction from northwest to west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal flow patterns. The combination of high humidity, stable temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, likely contributing to foggy conditions, especially during the overnight hours.
