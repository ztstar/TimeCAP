Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming period in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air, likely from a shallow boundary layer or recent precipitation. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds remained consistently moderate throughout the period, with a sustained flow from the south-southeast to southwest, contributing to the transport of warm, moist air. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward clearer skies and drier air later in the day, with increasing stability and reduced potential for convective activity.
