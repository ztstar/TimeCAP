Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively stable until mid-morning, when a sharp increase occurred, indicating the arrival of moist air, likely due to marine influence or fog formation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds varied significantly, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a cooler, foggy, and moist period to a drier, warmer, and more stable environment, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate variability.
