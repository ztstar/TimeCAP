Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. A sharp increase in humidity, peaking at 100% during the early morning hours, suggests the formation of fog or low clouds, likely due to radiational cooling and moist onshore air. Air pressure remained consistently high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions, though a slight rise in the morning may have contributed to the clearing of fog. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and north, likely aiding in the dispersion of fog and promoting air mixing. The shift in wind direction from offshore to onshore and then back to offshore patterns reflects dynamic coastal influences, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimates.
