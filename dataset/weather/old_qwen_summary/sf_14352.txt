Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply as temperatures began to rise, suggesting a transition from a damp, cool period to a drier, milder one. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern, with a sustained period of high pressure in the middle of the night, followed by a decrease in the late afternoon, potentially indicating a shift in atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the early morning and late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to coastal influences. These combined trends point to a typical marine layer transition, with fog and cool conditions giving way to clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
