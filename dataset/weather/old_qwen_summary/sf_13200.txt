Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the overnight period, particularly in the early hours, indicating the influence of marine fog and low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, suggesting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward stronger westerly and northwesterly flows, consistent with offshore winds typical of coastal dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a foggy, cool morning into a drier, warmer, and more stable afternoon, typical of a summer day in San Francisco under a developing high-pressure ridge.
