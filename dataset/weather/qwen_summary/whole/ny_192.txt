Temperature showed a gradual rise through the night, followed by a sharp increase during the morning hours, indicating warming conditions likely linked to solar insolation. Humidity peaked dramatically in the late night and early morning, dropping abruptly in the late afternoon before rebounding, suggesting possible precipitation or fog development. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching a low point in the evening, which may signal an approaching weather system or storm front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction, implying a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of rising temperature, fluctuating humidity, falling pressure, and changing wind suggests the potential for unstable weather conditions, possibly including thunderstorms or a frontal passage.
