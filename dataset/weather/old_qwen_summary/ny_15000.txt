Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling nighttime phase likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or mist formation, possibly contributing to reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before rebounding slightly in the late morning, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought overcast conditions and precipitation. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief calm period during the early hours and a shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late morning, implying a change in air mass and potential for storm development. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, with lingering damp conditions and the potential for unsettled weather later in the day.
