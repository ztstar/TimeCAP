Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting the influence of marine layer dynamics. Air pressure showed a notable spike during midday, followed by a sharp drop in the evening, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system or a frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight hours, particularly from the west-southwest, indicating the influence of offshore flow or a developing breeze from the Pacific. These combined patterns reflect the typical coastal weather behavior in San Francisco, with strong marine influence, variable wind direction, and temperature moderation, potentially leading to foggy conditions in the early morning and clearing skies later in the day.
