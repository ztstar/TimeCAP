Over the past 24 hours, temperatures remained consistently low, indicating a prolonged cold spell with minimal warming during the day. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before slightly declining, suggesting moisture accumulation in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate and consistent, with prevailing winds from the northwest, contributing to the cold, dry air advection across the city. The combination of sustained low temperatures, rising pressure, and stable wind patterns points to a strong, persistent high-pressure ridge, likely resulting in clear skies and cold, dry weather in the immediate forecast.
