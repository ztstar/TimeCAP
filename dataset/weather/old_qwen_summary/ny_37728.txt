Over the past 24 hours, temperatures gradually increased, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike to saturation followed by a sharp drop, suggesting possible precipitation or atmospheric instability. Air pressure declined steadily, especially in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, consistent with the passage of a frontal system. These combined indicators suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially unsettled weather, with increased risk of rain or thunderstorms later in the day.
