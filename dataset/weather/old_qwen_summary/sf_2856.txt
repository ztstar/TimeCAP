Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and remained consistently high, indicating a saturated air mass likely associated with marine influence. Air pressure increased steadily, peaking in the late evening, suggesting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that has stabilized conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight, particularly after midnight, while wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to southerly and then northeasterly, possibly signaling a change in the local circulation pattern. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, damp, and windy coastal regime to more stable, drier, and calmer conditions, which may lead to clearer skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
