Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures consistently declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the early hours and dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass or the influence of a drying wind. Air pressure showed a steady increase, particularly in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening and early morning, with a notable rise to strong levels, accompanied by variable wind directions that shifted from easterly to westerly and then back, hinting at dynamic local flow patterns. These combined indicators suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, potentially reducing the likelihood of fog and improving visibility across the city.
