Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime patterns. Humidity remained near saturation during the night and early morning, sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of overnight moisture and the onset of drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, peaking in the late afternoon, which typically signals improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and early evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, possibly indicating a change in air mass or the influence of a developing local circulation. These combined trends point to a post-precipitation clearing phase, with drying air and strengthening winds suggesting a transition toward more stable, fair weather conditions.
