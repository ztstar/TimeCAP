Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cool start and warming trend. Humidity levels experienced a significant spike in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or high moisture content, which later dropped sharply, likely due to the onset of drier air and increased wind. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speed increased notably in the afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, indicating changing flow patterns possibly associated with a developing weather front. These combined factors suggest a transition toward fairer, drier weather in the coming hours, with improved visibility and a reduced chance of precipitation.
