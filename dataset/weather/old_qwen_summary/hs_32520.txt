Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the day, particularly after midday, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a notable increase in the early hours and a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then northwesterly, consistent with the influence of a developing high-pressure ridge. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, likely leading to improved air quality and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
