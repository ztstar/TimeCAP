Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a consistent and gradual increase, indicating stable atmospheric conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with a notable lull around dawn, followed by a return to moderate breezes in the afternoon, likely driven by coastal dynamics. Wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to southerly during the night, reflecting changing airflow patterns, which may have contributed to the advection of moist marine air and the development of low clouds or fog.
