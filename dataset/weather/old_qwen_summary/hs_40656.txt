Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then sharply declined during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend likely associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late afternoon, aligning with potential inflow from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined patterns suggest a transition toward more unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
