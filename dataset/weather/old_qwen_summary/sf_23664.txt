Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the coastal climate. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and the absence of significant storm systems in the region. Wind patterns shifted from a southerly to a more westerly direction during the night, aligning with typical marine layer dynamics that bring cool, moist air inland. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and consistent wind suggests continued fog and low cloud cover may persist into the coming hours, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas.
