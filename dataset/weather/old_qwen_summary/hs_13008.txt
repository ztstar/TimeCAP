Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning, dropping significantly through the afternoon, which suggests the atmosphere became drier as temperatures climbed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift from southerly to more westerly and then northwesterly directions, consistent with the development of a frontal boundary. These combined factors point to an evolving weather pattern that may lead to thunderstorms or heavy rain in the near term.
