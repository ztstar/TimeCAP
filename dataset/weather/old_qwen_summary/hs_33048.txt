Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures peaking in the afternoon before declining through the evening and early morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, remaining elevated through the night and into the morning, indicating moisture accumulation likely due to nocturnal condensation or a shallow boundary layer. A gradual drop in air pressure was observed, particularly in the final hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and northerly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. Collectively, these trends point to a transition in atmospheric conditions that could lead to increased cloud cover and potential for showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
