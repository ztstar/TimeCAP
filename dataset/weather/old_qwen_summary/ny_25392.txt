Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moist air that may have contributed to fog or low visibility during the night. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated, with stronger gusts in the afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, which may have helped mix air layers and disperse moisture. The shift in wind direction from prevailing westerly to more southerly and easterly patterns late in the period hints at a potential change in air mass, possibly signaling a transition toward more variable or unsettled weather in the coming hours.
