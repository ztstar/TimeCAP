Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of urban environments. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before declining, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to overnight condensation or low-level air mass changes. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend throughout the day, culminating in a low-pressure system that may signal an approaching weather front. Wind speeds remained moderate overall, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that suggest changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to the approaching low-pressure system. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather conditions, with potential for precipitation or changing skies in the near term.
