Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in air pressure, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Temperatures showed a steady rise during the day, peaking in the afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, suggesting a warm front followed by a cold front. Humidity levels remained high for much of the day, particularly in the midday and early evening hours, contributing to a muggy atmosphere and increasing the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the southwest and west sectors, consistent with storm dynamics. The shift in wind direction from the northeast to the west and northwest during the evening indicates a change in air mass, supporting the arrival of cooler, drier air behind the front.
