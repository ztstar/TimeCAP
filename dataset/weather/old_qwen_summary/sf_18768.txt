Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting reduced mixing in the lower atmosphere, further enhancing fog formation and retention. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west and then southward late in the day suggests a change in airflow, which may be linked to the development of a marine layer and could influence coastal weather patterns in the coming hours.
