Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near dawn before declining sharply in the afternoon, indicating the passage of a moist air mass. Air pressure showed a pronounced increase during the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which stabilized conditions and likely suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then to west-southwesterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure build-up. These trends suggest a transition from a humid, stable air mass to a drier, more settled environment, reducing the likelihood of storms but potentially increasing daytime heat retention.
