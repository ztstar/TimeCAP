Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a pronounced overnight dip followed by a steady rise, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and cooling at night. Humidity levels experienced a sharp increase during the early morning hours, coinciding with a marked temperature drop, suggesting the onset of fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point before beginning a gradual recovery, which is typically associated with the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest to west-southwest directions, signaling the arrival of stronger flow likely linked to the developing low-pressure system. Combined, these trends suggest that New York City is transitioning into a period of potentially unsettled weather, with increased chances of precipitation and stronger winds in the near term.
