Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to a damp and chilly feel, followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon as air pressure began to rise. A notable increase in wind speed and a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions occurred in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. The sustained rise in air pressure during the late afternoon and evening indicates the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. These trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and windy night into a drier and more stable daytime atmosphere, with potential for improved visibility and milder temperatures later in the day.
