Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the nighttime hours, with temperatures dropping significantly as the day transitioned into night. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking at very high levels, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is common in the region during marine layer events. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the midday and early evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the afternoon and evening, with a notable shift to lighter winds overnight, followed by a return to stronger gusts in the early morning hours, likely associated with changing wind patterns across the bay. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind direction points to a persistent marine layer that has likely contributed to foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
