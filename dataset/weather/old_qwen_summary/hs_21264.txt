Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and a warming trend. Humidity levels showed a general decline, particularly in the late afternoon and night, suggesting drier air masses may be moving in or that evaporative cooling is reducing moisture content. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, reaching its lowest point toward the end of the period, which can signal the approach of a low-pressure system or potential for unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with consistent northeasterly to easterly flows, supporting the movement of air masses across the region. The combination of dropping pressure, decreasing humidity, and warming temperatures hints at a transition toward less stable atmospheric conditions, potentially increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
