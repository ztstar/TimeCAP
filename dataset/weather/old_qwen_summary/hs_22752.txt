Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly in the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing thermal energy in the atmosphere. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before midday, which suggests a buildup of moisture likely due to overnight condensation and low-level inflow. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting a lack of strong frontal activity but a slight rise in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a tightening of high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were consistently moderate, with a steady southerly to south-southeasterly flow throughout the day, which likely contributed to the transport of moist air into the region. These conditions collectively point to a humid, warming environment with potential for afternoon thunderstorms, especially as daytime heating intensifies and atmospheric instability increases.
