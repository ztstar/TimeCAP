Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating saturated air that contributed to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual rise, peaking in the late afternoon, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system bringing stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were light and variable overnight, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air mass dynamics. These patterns point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment toward a drier, more stable daytime regime, with minimal storm activity expected in the immediate future.
