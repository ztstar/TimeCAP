Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog or light precipitation during that period. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly, a classic sign of an approaching or passing storm system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with sustained stronger winds from the northeast, consistent with frontal passage and potential for gusty conditions. The shift in wind direction from east to northeast and the overall atmospheric instability point to an active weather pattern that could bring further showers or storms later in the day.
