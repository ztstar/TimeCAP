Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s coastal climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but declined slightly in the late evening, potentially signaling a change in atmospheric conditions. Wind activity was minimal overall, with brief bursts of light to moderate winds, primarily from the west and southwest, consistent with typical coastal breezes. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and southeast in the late night and early morning may indicate the influence of a changing pressure gradient, possibly hinting at the arrival of a new weather system.
