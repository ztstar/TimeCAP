Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility, before dropping significantly in the latter half of the day as air warmed. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that may have stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds intensified during the night and early morning, then declined markedly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly and southerly, reflecting a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest a transitioning weather regime, potentially marking the end of a moist, cool period and the onset of clearer, drier conditions.
