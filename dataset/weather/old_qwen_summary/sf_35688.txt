Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that contribute to persistent fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable decline during the night, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, which may signal a transition in atmospheric stability and potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the period, with a shift toward stronger southwesterly winds in the final hours, suggesting increasing circulation that could bring changes in temperature or precipitation. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting wind direction points to a likely continuation of foggy, cool conditions with possible development of low clouds or drizzle in the near term.
