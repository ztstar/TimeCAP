Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily, indicating a transition from damp, stable conditions to drier, more dynamic air. A steady drop in atmospheric pressure suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with sustained strong winds from the west and southwest, contributing to the cooling and moisture transport. These combined factors point to an active weather shift, potentially bringing precipitation or stormy conditions in the near term.
