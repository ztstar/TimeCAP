Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cool, stable night to a milder daytime period. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with a sharp decline during mid-morning and a sudden surge later in the day, suggesting possible convective activity or shifting air masses. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the late morning before a sharp drop, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early hours, with sustained strong winds from the northwest and west, followed by a shift to predominantly easterly and northeasterly directions in the late afternoon and evening, consistent with a coastal influence. The combination of rising pressure, strong winds, and fluctuating humidity points to dynamic atmospheric conditions, potentially indicating the passage of a frontal boundary or the onset of a storm system.
