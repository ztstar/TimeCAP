Temperatures dropped steadily through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising again in the morning, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend. Humidity spiked dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation and remaining elevated, suggesting the presence of fog or dense moisture that likely reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, followed by a sharp increase in the late morning, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were moderate during the night, with a notable increase in the pre-dawn hours, followed by a significant calm in the early morning, reflecting changing local wind patterns. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly directions suggests complex airflow dynamics, possibly influenced by coastal topography and evolving pressure gradients.
