Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before stabilizing slightly in the early morning. Humidity levels remained near saturation throughout the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog and low visibility, which is typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure showed a gradual decline in the late evening, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting a weakening low-pressure system moving out of the area. Wind speeds increased steadily through the morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, signaling a change in atmospheric flow that may bring clearer conditions. These patterns point to a transition from a dense, foggy marine layer to a more variable and potentially drier regime as the day progresses.
