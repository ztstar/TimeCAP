Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of a dense fog layer consistent with typical coastal conditions. A notable increase in air pressure during the late night and early morning coincided with a shift toward clearer skies and improved visibility, signaling possible subsidence or a weakening of coastal fog. Wind patterns showed a consistent southerly to westerly flow overnight, transitioning to more variable directions in the afternoon, which may reflect changing synoptic influences. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable winds implies a high likelihood of fog persistence into the early morning hours, with potential for gradual clearing as the day progresses.
