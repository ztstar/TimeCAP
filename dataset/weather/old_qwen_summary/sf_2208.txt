Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping steadily through the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations suggesting no strong frontal systems passed through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast and southeast, possibly due to local topographic effects and diurnal wind patterns. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast suggests a change in air flow, potentially signaling the influence of a developing coastal breeze or a weakening marine layer.
