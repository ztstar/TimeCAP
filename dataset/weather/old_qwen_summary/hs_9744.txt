Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning to decline, which suggests increasing moisture availability that could contribute to fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, particularly after midday, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained low until mid-afternoon, when they intensified briefly and shifted to more variable directions, potentially indicating localized atmospheric changes or early signs of convective activity. Overall, the data reflect a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic afternoon, with conditions conducive to clearing skies and improving comfort levels later in the day.
