Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a nocturnal temperature drop to a daytime recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly during the final hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low initially but intensified in the late evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, pointing to changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest that a frontal system passed through the region, resulting in cooler, moister conditions overnight, now giving way to drier, more stable weather expected to persist into the near future.
