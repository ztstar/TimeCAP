Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking and remaining very high through the night, which suggests saturated air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point before beginning a slight recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, consistent with a developing or approaching frontal system. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests a high likelihood of thunderstorms or scattered showers in the near term.
