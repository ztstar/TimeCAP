Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cool, stable marine layer to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, suggesting persistent fog or low cloud cover, which began to clear as temperatures rose and humidity decreased in the afternoon. Air pressure steadily increased during the evening and overnight, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which is typical of a strengthening high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were subdued during the early morning but picked up in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west-southwest, consistent with the breakdown of the coastal inversion. These conditions point to a transition from a foggy, cool marine environment to a clearer, more stable afternoon, likely improving visibility and reducing the likelihood of precipitation.
