Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning and remaining elevated through the night before decreasing slightly in the late afternoon. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and consolidation of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated notably, with a peak in the late afternoon and evening, driven by shifting wind directions from the south to the west and northwest, suggesting dynamic local circulation patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and strengthening winds late in the period points to improving weather conditions, likely clearing any lingering coastal fog and promoting brighter skies.
