Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked decline during the overnight period, reaching their lowest point in the early hours, which suggests dry air infiltration, likely due to shifting wind patterns. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a shift in direction from northeasterly to southerly and then back toward the northeast, reflecting dynamic airflow adjustments around the high-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and increasing daytime comfort despite the initial coolness.
