Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to west and then toward the southeast, consistent with the influence of a developing coastal low. These trends collectively suggest the onset of a changeable weather pattern, potentially leading to fog dissipation followed by increased wind and possible precipitation later in the day.
