Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked rise during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting a shift in air mass or possible moisture influx. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained stronger gusts from the southwest to west-southwest, consistent with a developing surface-level flow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These patterns suggest a transition toward drier, more stable air, with potential for reduced cloud cover and improved visibility as the high-pressure system consolidates.
