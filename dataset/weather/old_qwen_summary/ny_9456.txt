Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing daytime heating pattern. Humidity remained consistently high overnight, dropping significantly in the late morning and continuing to decline through the afternoon, suggesting clearing skies and reduced moisture content. Air pressure exhibited a continuous downward trend, particularly from midday onward, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system likely bringing unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, with strong and consistent winds from the southwest to west sectors, consistent with the influence of a storm system moving through the region. These combined factors suggest that New York City is experiencing the onset of a dynamic weather shift, likely leading to precipitation and potentially gusty conditions in the near term.
