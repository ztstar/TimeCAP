Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the day. A significant increase in temperature occurred in the afternoon, indicating the arrival of warmer air, likely due to a shift in wind patterns. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, then dropped sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with the warming air. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to changing wind conditions. Wind speed increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, consistent with the development of a frontal system that could bring unsettled weather later.
