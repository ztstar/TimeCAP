Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility in the early hours. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period but showed a slight decline toward the end, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally low, with a consistent northerly to westerly flow that helped maintain cool, moist conditions along the coast. The shift in wind direction later in the day may signal the onset of a change in air mass, possibly bringing clearer skies and more variable conditions in the near term.
