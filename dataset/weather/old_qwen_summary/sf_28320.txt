Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and low visibility during the pre-dawn hours. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sharp rise during the night and early morning, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions in the afternoon. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly and easterly directions at night to more westerly and variable flows in the morning, suggesting a change in local circulation influenced by coastal dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable wind directions points to a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for fog and cool conditions persisting into the next day.
