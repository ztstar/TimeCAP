Temperature trends indicate a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising toward morning, suggesting a cold night followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels increased significantly during the late night and early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which may contribute to fog formation or damp conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and into the early morning, then began to decline, signaling a possible shift in weather systems. Wind speeds decreased through the night, reaching a minimum in the early hours, before increasing again, with a notable change in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in airflow patterns. The combination of rising humidity, falling wind speeds, and shifting wind direction suggests the potential for fog or low visibility in the morning, with a possible transition to more dynamic weather conditions later in the day.
