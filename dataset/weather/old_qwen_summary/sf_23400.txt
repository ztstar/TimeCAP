Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low cloud cover that likely formed during the cooler hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a sustained drop in the latter half of the period may signal the approach of a weather system or changing atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds decreased through the night and early morning, then began to increase again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southwest to more southerly and easterly, which could indicate a change in airflow patterns due to regional pressure gradients. These combined trends suggest the city is transitioning from a foggy, cool nocturnal phase toward a warmer, drier afternoon, with potential for clearing skies and increasing wind activity later in the day.
