Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight before sharply decreasing in the late morning, suggesting clearing skies and drying air associated with the advancing front. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing at a high level, which typically correlates with fair weather and improved conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the afternoon, particularly from the southwest to west-southwest, indicating the influence of a strong low-pressure system’s periphery. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cold, damp environment to a drier, cooler, and increasingly stable atmosphere, likely bringing clearer skies and a noticeable drop in perceived temperature.
