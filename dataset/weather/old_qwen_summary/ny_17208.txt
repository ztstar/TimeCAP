Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed through the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a nocturnal temperature dip to a returning daytime heat pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking and remaining elevated throughout the day, which suggests increased moisture in the air and potential for fog or mist, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a high level, reflecting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that has brought stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day but remained moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, indicating changing air mass dynamics and possible influence from a nearby weather front. Overall, the combination of rising humidity, stable high pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests clear skies and mild conditions with a slight chance of fog early in the day, but generally favorable weather for outdoor activities later in the day.
