Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced surge during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor increase in the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns exhibited variability, with stronger and more consistent winds in the late evening and early morning, possibly driven by coastal sea breeze dynamics and pressure gradients. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and variable winds suggests a high likelihood of fog and low clouds continuing into the overnight period, potentially affecting visibility and morning commutes.
