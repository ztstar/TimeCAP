Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the overnight hours, particularly around dawn, indicating strong moisture accumulation likely due to coastal fog formation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a rapid recovery, suggesting the passage of a shallow low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to more easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions are typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, where marine influence and topography interact to produce localized, rapidly changing weather patterns.
