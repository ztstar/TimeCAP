Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low clouds as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night, peaking in the early morning and then stabilizing, which may reflect the influence of a high-pressure system enhancing atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with near-zero conditions in the early hours, but increased in the afternoon, likely due to the development of a land-sea breeze pattern. Wind directions varied widely overnight, shifting toward more onshore and southerly flows in the morning, which may have contributed to the transport of marine air and fog into the city.
