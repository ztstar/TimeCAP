Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, surged dramatically in the late night and early morning, and then dropped sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with near-zero values during the early hours, but picked up significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These trends point to a transition from a cool, moist marine layer to a drier, warming regime, consistent with the typical afternoon fog dissipation and wind shift observed in coastal San Francisco.
