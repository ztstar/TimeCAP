Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked significantly during the early morning hours, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to a noticeable drop in perceived temperature. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase during the early morning, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system, which may have stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief surges during the night, and wind direction shifted notably from southerly to northerly and then westerly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. These patterns indicate a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more variable daytime regime, potentially setting the stage for clearing skies and improving comfort later in the day.
