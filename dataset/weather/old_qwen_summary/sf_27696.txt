Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually increasing in the late morning, indicating a pronounced overnight cooling trend. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the evening and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a significant spike during the early hours, followed by a gradual drop, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from easterly to southerly and then to westerly directions, with increased speed later in the day, likely due to changing pressure gradients. These conditions collectively point to a transition period with coastal fog dissipation and the potential for improving visibility and clearer skies later in the day.
