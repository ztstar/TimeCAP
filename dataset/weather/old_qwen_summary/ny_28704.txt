Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong cold front passage. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours, spiked dramatically during the late night, and then plummeted again, suggesting the influence of a passing storm system with possible precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, culminating in a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were initially strong, particularly from the northwest, then diminished significantly in the late night and early morning, aligning with the weakening of the storm system. Combined with consistent wind direction from the northwest, these indicators point to a transition from stormy, cold conditions to a drier, more stable, and cooler weather pattern likely to persist into the coming days.
