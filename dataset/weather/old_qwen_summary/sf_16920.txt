Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning before gradually declining through the night and into the early hours of the next day. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, reaching saturation and remaining at 100% for an extended period, indicating high moisture content in the air and increasing the likelihood of fog formation. Air pressure remained nearly stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal activity and relatively stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which may signal the beginning of a change in air mass. These conditions—cooling temperatures, near-saturation humidity, and low wind speeds—create a high potential for dense coastal fog, particularly in low-lying and inland areas, which could impact visibility and commute conditions.
