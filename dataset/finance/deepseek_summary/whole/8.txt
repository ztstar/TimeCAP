Over the past 20 market days, equities have shown a generally upward trend with notable volatility, particularly in the S&P 500 and Nikkei 225, suggesting renewed investor confidence amid shifting macroeconomic expectations. The VIX exhibited a sharp spike mid-period followed by a sustained decline, indicating a transition from heightened fear to calmer sentiment, though recent stabilization suggests lingering uncertainty. Gold and crude oil both demonstrated resilience and upward momentum, reflecting safe-haven demand and persistent supply concerns, while the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates displayed subtle shifts, with the yen showing relative strength despite broader dollar fluctuations. The FTSE 100 posted a steady climb, outpacing other major indices, likely driven by strong performance in energy and financial sectors. Overall, markets appear to be pricing in a mix of inflationary pressures, central bank policy caution, and geopolitical risks, with diversification and risk management remaining critical for portfolio positioning.
