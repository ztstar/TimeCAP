Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by cloud cover and wind patterns. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting condensation and possible fog formation, which later decreased as temperatures rose and winds increased. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum just before dawn, followed by a slow recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and south, contributing to the dispersion of moisture and a drop in relative humidity. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and later to easterly suggests changing air mass dynamics, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies in the coming hours.
