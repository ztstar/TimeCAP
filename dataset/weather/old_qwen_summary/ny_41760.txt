Over the past 24 hours, a marked cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and remained elevated through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a transition from a saturated air mass to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant low-pressure system activity, which implies stable atmospheric conditions without immediate storm development. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, particularly between midnight and 6 AM, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a drier, cooler air mass from the northwest, which may lead to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
