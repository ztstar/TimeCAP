Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, suggesting the presence of moist air masses and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend throughout the night and early morning, stabilizing and then fluctuating slightly, which may signal the approach or passage of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with a shift in direction from southeast to southwest and eventually to west-northwest, indicating changing flow patterns possibly related to a developing synoptic-scale disturbance. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns suggests increasing instability, raising the potential for afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
