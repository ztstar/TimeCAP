Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a significant cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss and possibly cloud cover changes. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the late hours, which suggests a saturated air mass conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease toward the end of the period, signaling a possible approach of a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the late afternoon, which may indicate a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, falling pressure, and shifting winds suggests the potential for unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of precipitation or thunderstorms later in the day.
