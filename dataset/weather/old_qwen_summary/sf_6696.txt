Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, indicating persistent moisture in the air, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase from late night onward, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early hours, with calm conditions between midnight and 6 a.m., suggesting limited mixing of air and favorable conditions for fog persistence. The shift in wind direction from the south-southwest to more westerly and southerly sectors may reflect changing synoptic influences, potentially affecting coastal air flow and temperature distribution.
