A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that likely brought stormy conditions. Temperatures remained relatively stable through the night before rising steadily in the afternoon, indicating a gradual warming trend as the system evolved. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a sharp decline in the early morning followed by a sustained increase, suggesting the passage of a dry front followed by moist air infiltration. Wind speeds intensified during the midday and late afternoon, with gusts from the south and southwest, contributing to unstable atmospheric conditions. The shift in wind direction from the northeast to the south and west, combined with rising temperatures and humidity, points to a transition toward a more humid and potentially unsettled weather regime in the coming hours.
