Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, indicating the passage of a strong low-pressure system, which is typically associated with stormy conditions. Temperature trends show a sharp decline in the early hours, followed by a gradual warming, suggesting the influence of cold air advection initially, succeeded by a warming trend as the system progressed. Humidity levels peaked at near saturation during the night, coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which likely contributed to fog or light precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently strong throughout the period, with winds consistently blowing from the southwest, aligning with the typical flow around a developing low-pressure system. The combination of falling pressure, increasing wind, high humidity, and cooling temperatures points to a significant weather event, likely bringing precipitation and potentially hazardous conditions to New York City.
