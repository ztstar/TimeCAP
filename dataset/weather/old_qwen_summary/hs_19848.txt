Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, then began to decline, suggesting the air was becoming drier as temperatures rose. A consistent rise in atmospheric pressure, particularly from mid-afternoon onward, signals the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These combined trends point to a transition toward more stable, dry, and potentially clearer weather, with reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
