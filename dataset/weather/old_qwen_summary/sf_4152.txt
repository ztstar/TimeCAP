Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the middle of the night, followed by a recovery in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a passing weather system. Wind activity was variable, with strong gusts in the late evening and early morning, followed by calm conditions overnight and renewed winds in the late afternoon. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly patterns suggests a change in air mass, potentially signaling the arrival of a new, cooler marine influence.
