Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple instances of saturation, suggesting a moist and potentially unstable air mass. Air pressure showed significant fluctuations, including a notable rise followed by a sharp drop, which may signal the passage of a weather system, possibly a front. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening and overnight, with strong, steady winds from a northerly to easterly direction, likely associated with a developing low-pressure system. These conditions together point to an active weather pattern, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
