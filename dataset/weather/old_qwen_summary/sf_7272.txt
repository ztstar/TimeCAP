Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high overnight, particularly in the pre-dawn period, indicating strong moisture presence, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures through evaporative cooling. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system, possibly associated with incoming marine air or a shifting weather front. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly southerly and westerly directions to more variable and northerly flows later in the day, with increased gusts during the evening, hinting at dynamic atmospheric changes. These conditions collectively suggest the arrival of a coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, potentially bringing fog, cooler temperatures, and variable winds across the region.
