Over the past 24 hours, a notable temperature dip occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling night transitioning into a milder day. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout most of the period, with a sharp drop in the early hours before rebounding sharply in the late evening, suggesting a possible front passage or localized moisture shift. Air pressure exhibited a significant decline in the afternoon and early evening, reaching a low point before rebounding, which is indicative of a passing weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late evening and overnight hours, with gusts reaching strong levels, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then easterly, implying dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined indicators point to the influence of a developing or recently passed frontal system, potentially bringing unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation, in the immediate future.
