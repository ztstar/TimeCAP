Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching their lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining near saturation for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period, with a gradual decline in the final hours, suggesting the potential approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable increase toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-southwest to west, consistent with coastal influence. These conditions collectively suggest a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, potentially leading to cool, foggy mornings and improving conditions later in the day.
