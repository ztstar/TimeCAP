Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover that likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred midday, marked by strong gusts from the west and southwest, which coincided with a temporary drop in air pressure, suggesting a change in atmospheric dynamics. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly, possibly signaling the influence of a coastal trough or an approaching weather front. These combined factors—rising humidity, cooling temperatures, fluctuating pressure, and variable wind—point to a transition period likely associated with marine layer development and potential fog persistence into the evening.
