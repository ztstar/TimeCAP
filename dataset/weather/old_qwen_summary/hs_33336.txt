Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially linked to increased cloud cover and precipitation risk. Winds remained light throughout most of the night but increased slightly in the late evening and early morning, with a notable shift in direction indicating changing air mass influences. These conditions collectively suggest a transition toward more unstable weather, with a heightened potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
