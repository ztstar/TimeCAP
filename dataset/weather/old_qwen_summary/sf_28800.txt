Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature fluctuation, with a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating possible fog formation or marine layer influence. Air pressure dropped sharply during the early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding later in the day, which suggests the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more easterly and then northerly directions, with sustained onshore flow in the morning and a weakening of wind speeds during the late night and early morning. These combined factors point to a dynamic marine layer cycle, likely contributing to foggy conditions and cooler temperatures in coastal areas, with potential implications for visibility and travel during early morning hours.
