Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before showing a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating possible approaching atmospheric changes. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction suggesting changing air mass patterns. These combined conditions point to a transition period, potentially setting the stage for unsettled weather later in the day.
