Temperatures exhibited a clear overnight dip followed by a steady rise, indicating a transition from a cool, stable nighttime period to a warming morning and afternoon. Humidity fluctuated significantly, with periods of near-saturation during early morning hours and a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a drying air mass. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the late night and early morning, followed by a rebound in the afternoon, pointing to a passing low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and eventually westerly, consistent with the movement of a frontal system. Combined, these trends suggest a dynamic weather pattern with the potential for changing conditions, including possible precipitation or clearing skies later in the day.
