Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the late afternoon, suggesting a shift from cool marine influence to more stable daytime heating. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight and early morning periods, peaking in the mid-to-late morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by a sustained period of low pressure, which is often associated with approaching weather systems or storm activity. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the northeast, potentially signaling the arrival of a frontal system or a shift in prevailing winds due to topographical effects. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition—likely bringing overcast conditions and possible light precipitation—highlighting the importance of preparedness for changing coastal weather patterns.
