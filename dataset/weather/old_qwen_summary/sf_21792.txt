Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight decline toward the end, suggesting a weak atmospheric disturbance may be approaching. Wind speeds were generally low, with calm conditions prevailing during the early morning hours, though a modest increase occurred in the late evening. Wind direction shifted from northwest to southwest during the night, indicating a change in airflow that may be associated with the transition from marine layer dominance to a more variable pattern.
