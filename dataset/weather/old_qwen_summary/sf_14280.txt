Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A significant drop in wind speed during the early morning hours, coupled with near-still air and high humidity, suggests the presence of a stable marine layer. As the day progressed, wind speeds increased and air pressure rose steadily, signaling the breakdown of the marine layer and the onset of clearer, drier conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns reflects changing synoptic influences, potentially indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that will bring improved weather in the coming hours.
