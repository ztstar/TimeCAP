Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling front's passage. Humidity levels showed a pronounced decline during the day, suggesting dry air infiltration, which may have suppressed cloud development and precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, reaching a peak in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival and dominance of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds decreased notably after midday, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable and ultimately southerly, hinting at a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest that Houston transitioned from cooler, drier conditions under a strong high-pressure influence, with limited potential for storms or precipitation in the immediate future.
