Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a cooling trend followed by a warming phase likely tied to diurnal cycles and changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden air mass that subsequently dissipated. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the midday hours, followed by minor fluctuations, which may reflect the influence of a high-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and south-southeast, with gusts reaching notable levels, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary or shift in circulation patterns. The shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly in the final hours suggests changing airflow dynamics that could precede a shift in weather conditions, including possible precipitation or cooler air advection.
