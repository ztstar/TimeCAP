Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery through the day, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely driven by marine influence. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility in coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early to mid-day hours before a noticeable decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were low and steady overnight, with a shift toward more consistent easterly to southerly winds, which may have facilitated the influx of moist marine air. The combination of near-100% humidity, cooling temperatures, and weakening pressure signals a high probability of persistent fog and cool conditions into the following day.
