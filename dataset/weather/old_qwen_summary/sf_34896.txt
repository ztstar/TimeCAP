Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained relatively high overnight before sharply declining during the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air, likely due to offshore winds. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a brief rise midday, but overall stability, implying no significant storm systems impacted the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, particularly from the southeast and later from the west-southwest, signaling a shift in local wind patterns that may have facilitated the drying trend. The combination of warming temperatures, dropping humidity, and variable wind direction suggests a transition toward a more stable, dry, and potentially sunny afternoon to evening period.
