Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before rebounding in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant cooling trend during the early hours. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, then fluctuated, suggesting moisture accumulation likely associated with a weakening frontal system. Air pressure remained stable through the night before steadily increasing into the afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly during the evening hours, with gusts reaching strong levels, likely due to shifting pressure gradients and a change in wind direction from southerly to westerly. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a gradually clearing and more stable afternoon, with reduced chances of precipitation but potential for breezy conditions as the high-pressure system consolidates.
