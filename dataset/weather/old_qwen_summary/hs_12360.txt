Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the clearing of low-level moisture. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and morning, reaching a peak in the midday, which is consistent with the approach of a high-pressure system bringing stable, drier conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the late night and early morning, increasing significantly in the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime environment, likely associated with the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
