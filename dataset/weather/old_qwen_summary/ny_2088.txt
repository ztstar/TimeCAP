Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in atmospheric pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system associated with stormy conditions. Temperature fluctuated with a cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained elevated for much of the period, with notable spikes coinciding with falling pressure, pointing to active moisture transport and potential precipitation. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the middle of the period, particularly from the northeast and east, followed by a shift to more southerly and westerly directions, consistent with frontal passage and changing storm dynamics. These combined factors suggest a weather pattern conducive to strong winds, possible rain or snow, and a sharp drop in temperature, particularly in the coming hours.
