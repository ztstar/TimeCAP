Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with notable spikes during the night, suggesting the presence of fog or moist air masses common to the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a significant drop overnight, culminating in a sharp decrease in the early morning, which often precedes unsettled weather or storm systems. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late evening and early morning, with strong gusts from the south and southeast, likely driven by a developing low-pressure system. The combination of falling pressure, rising wind speeds, and persistent humidity points to an active weather pattern that could bring overcast conditions or light precipitation in the near term.
