Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the overnight hours, reaching a low before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cold night and warming day. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning and midday, then increased significantly in the late evening, suggesting possible moisture influx or dew point rise. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, peaking in the late afternoon and maintaining a high level, which generally signals stable, dry weather and a weakening of storm systems. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and in the morning, increased through the afternoon, and then decreased in the evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and changing wind patterns suggests the end of a cold, dry spell and the potential approach of a more humid, stable air mass.
