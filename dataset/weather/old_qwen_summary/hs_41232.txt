Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region's humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily into the early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and an increase in wind speed, signaling the approach of a weather system. The wind pattern showed a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow during the night and early morning, transitioning to more variable and stronger winds later in the day, likely due to frontal influences. These combined trends point to a developing atmospheric instability, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms or showery conditions in the near term.
