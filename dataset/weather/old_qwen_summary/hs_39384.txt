Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the late night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the likelihood of fog or dew formation, consistent with the low nighttime temperatures. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise, hinting at the passage of a weather front or changing atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south-southeast, potentially signaling the influence of a developing low-pressure system or convective activity. Combined with high humidity and increasing wind, these conditions raise the potential for unstable weather, including isolated thunderstorms, particularly during the late evening and overnight hours.
