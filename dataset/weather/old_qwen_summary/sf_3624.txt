Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally low at night, but increased during the morning and late evening, with shifts in wind direction suggesting changing air mass dynamics, including a possible onshore flow. These combined factors point to a transition period where coastal fog, mild temperatures, and developing instability may continue to influence local weather into the coming hours.
