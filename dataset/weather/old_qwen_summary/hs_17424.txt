Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before moderating slightly, suggesting increased moisture availability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period but showed a slight decline toward the end, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon and evening, with a consistent shift in wind direction from the northeast toward the east-southeast, indicating a change in circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the potential for developing convection later in the day, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours.
