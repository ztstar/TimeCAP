Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline through the early morning hours before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity remained high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly through the midday, suggesting a drying trend as air warmed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, particularly a sharp decrease to near 978 hPa, signaling the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, consistent with storm development. These combined indicators suggest that New York City experienced a transition from stable, damp conditions to a more dynamic and potentially stormy environment, likely bringing precipitation and unsettled weather in the near term.
