Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the night and early morning, reaching saturation in multiple intervals, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a peak in the early hours followed by a steady rise, signaling the influence of a passing weather system that may have brought in cooler, drier air. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with shifting wind directions indicating changing circulation patterns, possibly tied to coastal upwelling or a sea breeze. These conditions collectively point to a dynamic coastal environment typical of San Francisco, where temperature inversions, fog formation, and variable winds are common, particularly during transitional periods.
