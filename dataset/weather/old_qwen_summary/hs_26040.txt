Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a clear diurnal cycle likely influenced by overnight radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or mist formation during the early hours, particularly given the near-zero wind speeds and stable air conditions. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a rise in wind speed, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and drier conditions. Wind direction shifted from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, reflecting changing synoptic influences, possibly linked to an approaching front or pressure gradient adjustment. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and increasing wind speeds suggests a transition toward more stable and less humid conditions, potentially reducing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms in the coming hours.
