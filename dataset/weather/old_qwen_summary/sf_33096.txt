Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, then sharply declined during the afternoon, indicating a drying trend likely linked to changing wind patterns. A significant increase in wind speed occurred in the early morning, accompanied by a shift to strong westerly to southwesterly flow, suggesting the arrival of a coastal breeze or frontal passage. Air pressure showed a notable spike midday, followed by a drop in the late evening, which may signal the influence of a developing low-pressure system approaching from the northwest. These combined factors point to a dynamic transition in weather conditions, potentially setting the stage for changing skies and possible precipitation later in the day.
