Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before a sharp decline during the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass that likely brought drier conditions. Air pressure showed fluctuations, with a notable drop in the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could influence future storm development. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and persisted through the night, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions, including possible thunderstorms later in the day.
