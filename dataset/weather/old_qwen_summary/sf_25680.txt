Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with persistent high moisture content in the early hours, suggesting fog formation, which diminished during the afternoon as temperatures rose. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased wind speeds, indicating the approach of a weather system. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more variable and southerly, with a brief period of calm before a surge of stronger winds from the west-northwest. These indicators collectively point to a transitioning weather pattern, likely involving the movement of a marine layer and a developing atmospheric disturbance that may bring changing conditions in the coming hours.
