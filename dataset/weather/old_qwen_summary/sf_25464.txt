Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually rising. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly in the last several hours, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with gusts from the northwest and west, which may have contributed to the mixing of marine layer air and the dissipation of fog. The shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly patterns in the afternoon suggests a gradual change in airflow, potentially signaling the onset of a transitional period with improving visibility and warmer conditions.
