Temperature trends show a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually rising through the day, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a cool autumn or winter period. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the night, suggesting drier air masses moving in, which may have contributed to the temperature drop and reduced fog or mist formation. Air pressure steadily increased over the period, signaling the approach and dominance of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear skies. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon, particularly from the west-northwest direction, implying the influence of a strengthening surface-level high-pressure gradient. Combined, these patterns suggest improving weather conditions with decreasing cloud cover and lower chances of precipitation, though cooler temperatures may persist into the evening.
