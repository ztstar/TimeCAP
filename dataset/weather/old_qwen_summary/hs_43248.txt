Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to cool surface temperatures and moist air. Air pressure showed a general upward trend, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight drop, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased during midday and into the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially indicating a change in air mass. The combination of rising humidity, increasing wind, and fluctuating pressure suggests a transition period that could lead to unstable conditions, possibly increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
