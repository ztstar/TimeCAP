Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating high moisture content in the air, which likely contributed to a damp and foggy atmosphere during the overnight period. Air pressure remained relatively stable but gradually increased during the evening, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate dynamic air mass movements. These patterns suggest a transition from a cooler, humid, and somewhat unsettled night into a more stable and mild day, with potential for improving visibility and clearer skies later in the day.
