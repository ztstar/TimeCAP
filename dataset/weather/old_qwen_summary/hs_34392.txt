Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A notable wind shift occurred in the late evening, with stronger winds from the southeast and a change in direction indicating a possible influence from a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the day, suggesting a building high-pressure ridge, but recent fluctuations hint at dynamic atmospheric adjustments. The combination of elevated humidity, warming temperatures, and shifting wind patterns may signal the potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
