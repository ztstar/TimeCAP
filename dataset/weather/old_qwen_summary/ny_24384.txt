Temperature showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend followed by solar warming. Humidity remained elevated during the night and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation, likely due to dew point proximity, which may have contributed to fog or mist. Air pressure steadily increased over the 24-hour period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, with a notable increase in the late evening and early morning, accompanied by shifting wind directions that indicate changing atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and declining humidity suggests improving weather, with a transition toward drier, more stable conditions in the coming hours.
