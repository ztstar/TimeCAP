Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming period in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then surged dramatically in the afternoon before dropping sharply, suggesting the passage of a strong high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to southerly again, with increased wind speeds in the late afternoon, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These conditions suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, particularly as warm, dry air interacts with lingering moisture, increasing instability in the atmosphere.
