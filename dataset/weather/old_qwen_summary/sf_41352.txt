Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early and late hours, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the late afternoon, marked by a sudden increase in wind speed and a change in direction, suggesting the arrival of a new air mass. Air pressure showed a sharp rise in the early morning, followed by a sustained high-pressure regime, indicating stable atmospheric conditions, though a brief drop late in the day may signal a developing disturbance. These patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and foggy period to a drier, more variable regime, with potential for changing conditions later in the day.
