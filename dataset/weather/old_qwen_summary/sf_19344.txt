Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that contributed to a dense, damp atmosphere. Temperatures remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend toward the end of the period, suggesting a gradual warming pattern during the day. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the northeast, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to improving clarity and stability, likely reducing marine layer influence in the coming hours.
