Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual stabilization at colder levels, indicating a substantial cooling trend. Humidity remained consistently high throughout most of the period, with a notable increase toward the end, suggesting the presence of moist air that could contribute to fog or precipitation. Air pressure steadily declined, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that often brings unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased steadily, peaking in the final hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions, which may indicate the influence of a developing storm system. Together, these indicators suggest the onset of a cold, windy, and potentially precipitation-prone weather event across New York City.
