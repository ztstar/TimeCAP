Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable increase during the overnight hours and a sharp decrease during midday, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent clearing. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, culminating in a marked drop in the final hours, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or frontal passage. Wind speeds were generally light during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These patterns collectively suggest the onset of a dynamic weather transition, potentially bringing cooler, moister conditions and increased wind in the immediate forecast.
