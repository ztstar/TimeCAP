Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning periods, indicating stable moisture content in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a fluctuating but generally declining pattern, with a sustained drop in the final hours, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more easterly and southeasterly wind directions, which may facilitate moisture inflow. These combined factors—rising temperatures, persistent high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening southeast winds—point to the development of unstable conditions, increasing the likelihood of isolated thunderstorms in the coming hours.
