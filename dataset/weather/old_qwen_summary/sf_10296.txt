Temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a marine layer that dissipated as the sun warmed the surface. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions to the region. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief periods of higher activity, and wind direction shifted dramatically from a consistent westerly flow to variable patterns, possibly indicating a change in local circulation or a break in the marine layer. Overall, the data suggests a transition from a cool, foggy, and moist nocturnal period to a drier, clearer, and slightly warmer daytime pattern, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic regime.
