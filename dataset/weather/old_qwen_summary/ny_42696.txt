Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight period, indicating saturated air conditions likely contributing to fog or mist, which then sharply declined as temperatures rose. A notable increase in air pressure during the early morning hours suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased during the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow, possibly signaling the approach of a weather front. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and stable environment to a drier and more variable atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and more dynamic weather later in the day.
