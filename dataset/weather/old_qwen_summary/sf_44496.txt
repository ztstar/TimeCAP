Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced stable and unchanging atmospheric conditions, indicating a persistent weather regime with minimal variability. The consistent temperature across all hours suggests a lack of significant thermal changes, likely due to a stable air mass influencing the region. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, which may increase fire risk and contribute to rapid temperature fluctuations during daylight hours. Steady wind speed and a fixed wind direction imply a uniform airflow, likely driven by a broad-scale high-pressure system that suppresses storm development. This combination of dryness, stable pressure, and consistent winds reflects a clear, calm weather pattern typical of late summer in the Bay Area, with little chance of precipitation or significant weather changes in the near term.
