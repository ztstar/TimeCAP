Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early afternoon before steadily declining through the night, indicating the influence of a strong marine layer or nocturnal radiative cooling. Humidity levels remained elevated during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure showed minimal fluctuation, with slight drops around midday and early evening, consistent with the passage of a weak frontal system or coastal trough. Wind speeds were strongest in the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from west to southwest and eventually to the northeast, signaling a change in large-scale flow that may have introduced drier air. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal pattern in San Francisco, with cooling nights, persistent low clouds or fog, and variable wind patterns driven by local topography and the Pacific maritime influence.
