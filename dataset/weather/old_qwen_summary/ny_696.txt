Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early hours, associated with a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south and eventually southwest, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal system. A notable drop in humidity occurred mid-morning, followed by a rebound in the evening, indicating possible precipitation or moisture advection earlier in the cycle. The recent calm winds and rising pressure suggest improving weather, with the potential for clearer conditions and cooler temperatures in the near term.
