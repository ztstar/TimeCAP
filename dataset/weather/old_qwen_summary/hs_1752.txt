Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before declining sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of a stable boundary layer that trapped moisture overnight. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the early morning, reaching a peak midday before weakening slightly in the late afternoon, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds remained low until midday, then intensified during the afternoon, with directional shifts indicating a transition from southerly to easterly flow, potentially signaling the onset of a sea breeze or a change in synoptic conditions. These combined patterns suggest a developing atmospheric setup that could increase the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly if further moisture inflow and instability are present.
