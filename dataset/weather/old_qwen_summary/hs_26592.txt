Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% for several hours, suggesting the presence of fog or mist and increasing the likelihood of dew formation. A notable pressure fluctuation occurred in the early morning, with a sharp drop followed by a rebound, potentially signaling the passage of a weather front or a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally light until late afternoon, when they increased significantly, accompanied by shifts in wind direction that indicate changing air mass dynamics, possibly from a southerly to a more easterly or northerly flow. These combined factors suggest the possibility of unstable atmospheric conditions, heightening the potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
