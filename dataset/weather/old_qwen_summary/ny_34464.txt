Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooling trend overnight followed by warming. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting moisture accumulation, likely due to stable atmospheric conditions and potential fog formation. A gradual increase in air pressure during the midday and early evening suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and improved weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with variable directions indicating shifting airflows, possibly linked to a developing or passing weather front. The combination of rising pressure, moderate wind, and decreasing humidity in the late evening implies a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, favoring clearer skies overnight.
