Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal moderation. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before slightly declining, suggesting increased moisture availability, likely due to marine air intrusion. Air pressure remained stable with minor fluctuations, consistent with a relatively stable atmospheric regime, though a slight increase in the late afternoon may signal a weakening of coastal influence. Wind speeds were generally low, with periods of calm and weak, variable winds, while wind direction shifted from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting changes in local sea breeze patterns. These conditions point to a typical marine layer scenario, with potential for fog and overcast skies, especially in the early morning, and a transition toward clearer skies later in the day as temperatures rise and wind patterns stabilize.
