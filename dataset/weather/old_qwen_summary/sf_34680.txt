Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight and early morning hours, dropping significantly during the late afternoon and evening, suggesting clearing skies and improved air circulation. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were strongest during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south and east, possibly signaling a change in synoptic flow. These trends suggest increasing instability and potential for variable conditions, including possible fog dissipation and a shift toward more open, breezy weather.
