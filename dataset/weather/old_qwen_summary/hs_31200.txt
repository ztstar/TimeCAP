Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation in the early morning hours, then dropped sharply during midday before rebounding to high levels in the late evening, suggesting a mix of overnight condensation and potential moisture influx. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, particularly during the late evening and early night, signaling a possible approaching low-pressure system or frontal passage. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with a developing circulation pattern. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind suggests the potential for unstable conditions, possibly leading to thunderstorms or showers later in the night or early next morning.
