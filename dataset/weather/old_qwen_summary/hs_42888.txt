Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual temperature increase during the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the overnight period before declining through the afternoon, suggesting the influence of nocturnal moisture accumulation and subsequent mixing. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and morning, with a slight drop in the late afternoon and early evening, potentially signaling the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, which may indicate changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition period with increasing instability, raising the possibility of isolated thunderstorms later in the night or early morning.
