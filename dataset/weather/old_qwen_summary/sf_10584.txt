Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming in the late afternoon. A notable increase in humidity occurred during the night and early morning, likely due to the cooling air reaching dew point, contributing to foggy conditions. Air pressure showed a fluctuating pattern with a peak in the early morning, followed by a gradual decline, indicating possible shifts in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained generally light, with consistent directional shifts indicating variable flow patterns, particularly from the northwest and southwest sectors, which may reflect marine layer influence. These combined factors suggest the presence of a strong marine layer, with potential for persistent low clouds or fog, especially in coastal areas, affecting visibility and morning commute conditions.
