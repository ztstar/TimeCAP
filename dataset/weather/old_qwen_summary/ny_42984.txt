Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated into mid-morning before declining, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend in the latter half of the period, signaling improving weather conditions and a potential shift toward clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with higher velocities from the east and southeast, likely bringing in cooler marine air and influencing the rate of temperature change. The shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to southerly and then to more southeasterly suggests a dynamic flow pattern, possibly linked to a developing high-pressure system that could stabilize conditions overnight.
