Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a significant rise through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable but foggy conditions. Wind speeds remained low initially but increased notably in the afternoon, with stronger, more variable winds developing in the late evening, suggesting a shift in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer influence typical of the region’s coastal climate, with potential for continued fog and cool conditions into the following day.
