Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with high values persisting through the night and early morning, dropping sharply during midday, and rising again in the evening—suggesting the presence and dissipation of coastal fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changes in local airflow, likely driven by sea breeze and synoptic influences. These conditions together suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable regime, with potential for clearing skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
