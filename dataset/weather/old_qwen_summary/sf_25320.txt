Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon. Humidity levels were high in the early morning hours, dropped sharply during midday, and then rose again in the evening, indicating a shift from foggy or coastal conditions to drier inland air. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the late night and early morning, with strong southerly and southeasterly winds, likely driven by a coastal upwelling or sea breeze pattern. The combination of rising pressure, warming temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a transition from a cool, foggy marine layer to a warmer, drier, and more stable air mass, typical of a late spring or early summer day in the region.
