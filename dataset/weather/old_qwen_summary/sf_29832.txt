Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low clouds, which then dropped sharply during midday, suggesting a clearing of marine layer conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the drying and warming trend. Wind speeds strengthened during the late afternoon and early evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These changes collectively suggest a transition from a cool, foggy coastal regime to a drier, more stable weather pattern, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal coastal dynamics.
