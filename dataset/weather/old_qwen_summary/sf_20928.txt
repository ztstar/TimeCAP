Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a modest warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning, indicating significant moisture presence and potential for fog formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting an approaching weather system or low-pressure development. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with brief lulls and shifts in direction, most notably a notable change from southwesterly to northeasterly winds during the early morning hours. These conditions collectively point to a stable, moist marine layer with subtle dynamics, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, and may contribute to persistent fog or overcast skies in the coming hours.
