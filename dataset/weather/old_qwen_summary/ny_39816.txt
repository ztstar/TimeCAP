Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cooling trend. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly during the day, suggesting a transition from dry to more moisture-laden air. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, reaching a sustained high in the latter half of the day, signaling the influence of a stable high-pressure system that typically brings clear and calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, possibly indicating the approach of a boundary or changing air mass. Collectively, these patterns suggest a transition from cooler, drier, and more stable conditions to a period of increasing wind and potential for changing weather, with implications for outdoor activity and air quality.
