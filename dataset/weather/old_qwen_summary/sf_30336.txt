Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed cloud development. Wind patterns shifted from mild and consistent to stronger and more variable, particularly in the late evening and early morning, with gusts from the west and northwest, aligning with typical marine layer dynamics. The combination of elevated humidity, cooling temperatures, and strong onshore winds points to a persistent marine layer, which may continue to bring foggy and cool conditions into the coming hours.
