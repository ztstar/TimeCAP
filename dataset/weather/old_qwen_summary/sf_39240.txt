Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced temperature dip occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained low during the morning but surged dramatically in the late night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a slight fluctuation, with a notable drop in the mid-afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system or a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds increased significantly during the mid to late night, particularly from the southeast and southwest, coinciding with a shift in wind direction that suggests a change in synoptic conditions, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or frontal passage. The combination of rising humidity, variable wind direction, and pressure changes implies an active meteorological environment, potentially leading to foggy conditions and cooler temperatures in the coming hours.
