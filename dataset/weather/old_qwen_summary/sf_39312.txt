Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a marked cooling trend during the overnight and early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure began to stabilize before increasing significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the northwest, indicating stronger atmospheric mixing and potential for clearing conditions. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly suggests a dynamic shift in air mass, possibly signaling the transition from marine-influenced conditions to more inland characteristics.
