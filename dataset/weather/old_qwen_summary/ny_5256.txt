Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回升 during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a transition toward milder conditions. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds and may have contributed to a damp, oppressive feel during the night. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, indicating the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined factors point to a period of unstable weather, with potential for precipitation and changing conditions in the near term.
