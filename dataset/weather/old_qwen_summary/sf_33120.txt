Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon as temperatures rose, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, followed by a rebound in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased substantially overnight, with strong west-to-southwest winds in the evening and early morning, possibly driven by coastal influences and pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from coastal to inland sectors later in the day, combined with the pressure rise, points to a transition toward more stable and potentially clearer conditions.
