Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before modestly rising in the late afternoon. Humidity surged dramatically during the early morning hours, reaching saturation levels and persisting through mid-morning, indicating the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a notable rise, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, suggesting the influence of a stable high-pressure system that has likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm conditions prevailing, but increased slightly in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, which may signal a change in air mass. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer and foggy conditions during the overnight hours, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with a gradual clearing trend possible as the day progresses.
