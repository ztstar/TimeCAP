Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime heating. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining through the afternoon, suggesting the presence of overnight moisture accumulation and subsequent drying. Air pressure increased markedly during the early morning, reaching a sustained high, which typically signals the approach or dominance of a stable high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low overall, with a brief intensification during the night and early morning, accompanied by a shift from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, indicating changing flow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and stable wind conditions points to improving weather conditions, likely resulting in clear skies and a transition toward more comfortable temperatures in the coming hours.
