Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture. Temperature trends showed a gradual cooling through the night, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon, suggesting a diurnal pattern typical of coastal regions influenced by marine air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling the potential approach of a high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were consistently low overnight, increasing slightly in the afternoon, while wind direction shifted from westerly to more southerly and then back to westerly, reflecting changing synoptic influences. These conditions point to a typical coastal marine layer pattern, with foggy mornings and clearing afternoons, consistent with San Francisco’s characteristic microclimate.
