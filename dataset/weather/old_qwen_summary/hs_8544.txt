Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly but remaining elevated through the day, suggesting increased moisture availability. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with notable spikes in the early and late hours, indicating the passage of multiple weather systems, including a brief high-pressure influence followed by a low-pressure trough. Wind patterns shifted dramatically, transitioning from consistent easterly flow to fluctuating directions, including strong southerly and westerly components, which may have contributed to moisture advection and instability. These combined factors suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, with potential for developing convective activity later in the day, particularly if daytime heating intensifies.
