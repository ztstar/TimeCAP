Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds, reducing visibility and creating a damp, chilly feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that could precede a change in weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then to northeasterly directions, with a brief increase in speed during the mid-afternoon, suggesting a developing surface-level circulation. These combined factors point to a transition period, potentially leading to overcast skies and a chance of light precipitation later in the day.
