Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the evening and early night, then surged dramatically, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting the arrival of moist air, possibly from marine influence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished overnight, reaching near calm conditions during the pre-dawn hours, followed by a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then easterly in the late morning, hinting at a change in atmospheric flow. These combined factors suggest a transition toward more stable and potentially foggy conditions in the early morning, followed by a gradual clearing and warming trend as the high-pressure system consolidates.
