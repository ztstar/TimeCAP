Temperature showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting overnight condensation and dew formation, followed by a significant drop as temperatures rose, reflecting drying conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained moderate with intermittent increases, particularly in the afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions—especially a notable shift toward the west and northwest—indicating changing air mass dynamics. Together, these trends suggest a transitioning weather pattern, with the potential for increasing cloudiness and possible precipitation later in the day.
