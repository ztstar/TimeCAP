Temperature trends show a steady overnight decline followed by a pronounced rise during the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle typical of coastal areas. Humidity levels exhibit sharp fluctuations, with prolonged periods of low humidity during the day and spikes at night, suggesting the influence of marine layer dynamics and drying winds. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a gradual increase through the day, reflecting the presence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization of conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, with strong gusts from the north and west, potentially driven by thermal gradients and the offshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the north and west in the late evening may signal the onset of a change in weather patterns, possibly bringing cooler air and increased cloud cover.
