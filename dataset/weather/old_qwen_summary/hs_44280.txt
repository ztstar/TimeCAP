Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of increasing solar heating and potentially a shift in air mass. Humidity remained consistently high during the early morning and overnight hours, suggesting saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or dew formation, while a sharp decline in humidity later in the day points to drier air infiltration. Air pressure steadily decreased in the latter half of the period, a sign of an approaching low-pressure system that could bring instability and precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with gusts from multiple directions, particularly from the southeast and south, indicating dynamic airflow associated with storm development. The combination of warming temperatures, falling pressure, and increasing wind activity signals a high likelihood of thunderstorms or convective activity in the near term.
