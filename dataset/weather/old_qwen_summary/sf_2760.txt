Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, then dropped significantly in the late afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or the onset of clearing conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, which is indicative of a high-pressure system dominating the region and contributing to stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds diminished to near zero during the early hours, with a brief resurgence in the late evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing local circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, moist, and calm night into a warmer, drier, and more stable day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge.
