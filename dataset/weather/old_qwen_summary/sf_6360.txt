Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking near saturation, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating strong moisture presence and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but generally remained stable, with a brief increase followed by a slight decline, suggesting limited large-scale weather system changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional bursts and a notable calm period in the late evening, while wind direction shifted across multiple sectors, reflecting variable airflow patterns typical of the region’s coastal topography. These conditions together point to a persistent marine influence, likely contributing to fog development and cool, damp conditions, especially during the overnight hours.
