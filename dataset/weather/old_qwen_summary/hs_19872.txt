Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a prolonged cooling trend, likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning hours, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting increasing moisture content in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speed diminished toward the end of the period, while wind direction shifted progressively from northeasterly to southeasterly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These combined trends point to a developing weather pattern that could lead to increased cloud cover and potential precipitation in the near term.
