Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop in the late afternoon and a sharp increase overnight, indicating possible fog formation or marine layer development. Air pressure showed a sustained rise through the midday, peaking sharply before declining, suggesting a passing weather system that may have brought temporary stabilization followed by change. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a brief lull in the late afternoon and a resurgence in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, typical of coastal influences. These patterns suggest an evolving marine layer and the potential for foggy conditions, particularly in the early morning hours, which could impact visibility and commute conditions.
