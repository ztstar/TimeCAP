Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early afternoon, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system, which may have suppressed cloud development and contributed to clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds intensified in the late evening, particularly from the south-southwest, suggesting a shift in circulation that could bring in maritime air. The combination of elevated humidity, fluctuating pressure, and changing wind direction indicates a dynamic transition in the local weather pattern, potentially setting the stage for a more pronounced coastal fog event overnight.
