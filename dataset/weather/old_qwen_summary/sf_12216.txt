Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating a significant increase in moisture, likely due to fog formation or marine layer influence. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting sustained high-pressure dominance, which typically correlates with clear skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the overnight hours, particularly from the southwest, before subsiding and shifting direction to the northeast by morning, reflecting a change in air mass dynamics. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer that has likely contributed to early morning fog, with gradual clearing expected as temperatures rise and winds ease.
