Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in atmospheric pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather. Temperature gradually increased throughout the day, suggesting a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels spiked dramatically during the early morning, remaining near saturation, which contributed to foggy conditions and reduced visibility. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest during the late night and early morning, followed by a return to more variable but generally light winds. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and falling pressure suggests the potential for precipitation in the near term, especially as the system matures.
