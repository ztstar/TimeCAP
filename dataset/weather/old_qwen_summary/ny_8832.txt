Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, signaling the passage of a strong low-pressure system through the region. This drop coincided with rising humidity and a sharp decline in temperature, indicating the arrival of a cold front accompanied by widespread cloud cover and precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the night, with southerly and westerly winds bringing in moist air, followed by a shift to more easterly and northeasterly directions in the late morning. The wind direction change and sustained pressure readings below 985 hPa suggest that the low-pressure system remained in proximity, likely contributing to persistent overcast conditions and possible rain. These conditions collectively point to a period of unstable, unsettled weather in New York City, with potential for continued precipitation and cooler temperatures in the immediate forecast.
