Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend followed by warming. Humidity levels dropped significantly after midnight, reflecting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions, especially in the afternoon, which may contribute to increased comfort despite rising temperatures. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, particularly from the west-northwest, then moderated with shifting wind directions, indicating dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cool, moist, and windy night to a drier, warmer, and more stable daytime forecast, consistent with an approaching high-pressure ridge.
