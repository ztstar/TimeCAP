Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking at saturation and remaining near 100% for many hours, indicating the presence of dense fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning, suggesting an approaching weather system or low-pressure influence. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to northeasterly, with increasing speeds in the early morning hours, likely driven by the development of a coastal breeze or frontal passage. These conditions collectively point to a maritime influence, with foggy, cool, and moist weather likely persisting into the coming hours, affecting visibility and outdoor comfort.
