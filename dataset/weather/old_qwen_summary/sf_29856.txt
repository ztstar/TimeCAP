Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels remained high during the early hours, dropping sharply in the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant drying trend likely due to clearing skies and increased wind. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early night, followed by a sustained drop through the afternoon and early evening, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds were initially light and variable, but intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with strong southerly to southwesterly winds dominating, potentially contributing to the drying and mixing of air masses. These patterns together indicate a transition from a stable, fog-prone environment to a drier, windier regime, which may lead to improved visibility and milder conditions in the coming hours.
