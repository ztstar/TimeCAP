Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a persistent damp feel and likely supported the development of fog or mist in the early morning hours. A significant rise in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a stable high-pressure system that brought drier and more settled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more variable and eventually westerly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stable nighttime regime to a drier, more variable daytime environment, reducing the likelihood of precipitation but enhancing comfort as the pressure stabilizes.
