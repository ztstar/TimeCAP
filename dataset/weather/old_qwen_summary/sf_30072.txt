Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight temperature drop, followed by a gradual warming trend during the day, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of coastal climates. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before sharply declining, suggesting the influence of marine fog and subsequent clearing. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the late evening and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, likely signaling the arrival of a coastal upwelling or a change in synoptic flow. Air pressure showed a complex pattern with a sustained high-pressure ridge in the early hours, followed by a fluctuating trend that may reflect the passage of a weak frontal feature or local atmospheric instability. These conditions collectively suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a clearer, windier, and gradually warming day, typical of San Francisco’s variable microclimates.
