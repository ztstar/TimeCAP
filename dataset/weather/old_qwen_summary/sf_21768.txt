Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining significantly during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained largely stable, with minor fluctuations, suggesting a relatively calm synoptic environment without strong frontal activity. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with a shift to lighter winds and variable directions, including a notable shift toward the southeast and east in the late night and early morning, potentially signaling a change in local circulation. The combination of rising humidity, low wind speeds, and cooling temperatures in the early hours increases the likelihood of fog formation, particularly near coastal areas, which is consistent with San Francisco’s typical microclimatic patterns.
