Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the arrival of drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained moderate to high, with directional shifts indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly due to evolving synoptic-scale dynamics. These trends collectively suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather conditions, which may reduce the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
