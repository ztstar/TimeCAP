Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a significant overnight cooling trend. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking before dropping steadily toward morning, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure exhibited a consistent and sustained increase, reflecting the approach and strengthening of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the mid to late night, with a notable surge in the early morning hours, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southwest to northwest, indicating a dynamic atmospheric adjustment. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, clearer, and more stable weather in the coming hours, likely reducing the chance of precipitation and improving visibility across the city.
