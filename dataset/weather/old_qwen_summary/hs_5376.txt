Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, more variable daytime air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally low during the night, with calm conditions around dawn, followed by a resurgence in wind activity in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to changing pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly and then to southwesterly suggests evolving airflow patterns, potentially influencing the movement of any upcoming weather systems into the region.
