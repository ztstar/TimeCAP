Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend typical of coastal regions. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, with brief dips in the midday, suggesting persistent moisture in the air, likely due to marine influence. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early hours, peaking midday before declining again, which may reflect the passage of a transient weather system. Wind speeds were low during the night and early morning, increasing significantly in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation. These combined factors suggest a coastal fog event with strong marine layer dynamics, potentially leading to continued cool, damp conditions and reduced visibility in the coming hours.
