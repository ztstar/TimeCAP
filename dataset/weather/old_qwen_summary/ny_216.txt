Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual decline during the night, followed by a steady rise through the morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, peaking at saturation, which contributed to a damp and oppressive feel, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase during the early hours, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and shifting directions, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes that could precede a weather shift. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a damp, cool night to a gradually warming, drier day, with potential for changing conditions later in the forecast period.
