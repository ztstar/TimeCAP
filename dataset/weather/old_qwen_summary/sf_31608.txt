Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with sustained periods of near-saturation conditions, particularly in the overnight hours, indicating potential fog or low cloud development. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before a sharp drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly during the midday, with stronger gusts from the west and northwest, consistent with coastal upwelling or a developing breeze pattern. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast in the final hours, paired with the falling pressure, hints at an evolving synoptic setup that could influence fog dissipation or precipitation onset in the coming hours.
