Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a dynamic diurnal cycle influenced by coastal conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the day, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture advection. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly reaching a peak just before midnight, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds remained low throughout the night and early morning, then increased slightly in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to northeasterly, indicating a change in local circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, drier air in the evening, which may enhance visibility and reduce the risk of precipitation.
