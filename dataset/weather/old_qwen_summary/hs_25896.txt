Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the overnight hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a low-pressure system or frontal boundary. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning hours, peaking before declining slightly, which is typical of a mid-level high-pressure system building in and stabilizing conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, with increasing speeds during the afternoon, hinting at the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a transition period where the city moved from a stable, moist environment to a more dynamic regime, increasing the likelihood of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
