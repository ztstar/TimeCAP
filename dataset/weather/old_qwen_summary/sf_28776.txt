Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, followed by a sharp decline, indicating a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer, drier air. Air pressure exhibited a notable fluctuation, with a significant drop during the early morning hours, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloudiness and moisture. Wind patterns shifted from light, variable flows in the early morning to stronger, more consistent winds from the south and southeast in the afternoon, likely aiding in the dispersion of fog and the drying of the atmosphere. The combination of falling temperatures, erratic pressure changes, and shifting wind directions points to an active weather front moving through the region, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions later in the day.
