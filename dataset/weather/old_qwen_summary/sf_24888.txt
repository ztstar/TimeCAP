Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle influenced by coastal air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with high values in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, before dropping sharply in the late afternoon—this pattern reflects the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then easterly, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics, possibly linked to a coastal upwelling or storm system. These combined trends point to a transitionary weather period, with potential for foggy conditions in the morning and increasing windiness later in the day, impacting outdoor activities and visibility.
