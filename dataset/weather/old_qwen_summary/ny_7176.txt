Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a marked cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air mass that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before steadily declining in the late afternoon, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly indicating an approaching frontal system. Wind speeds remained low to moderate during the night, increasing in the early morning and evening, with a consistent southerly to easterly flow, which may have transported warmer, moister air into the region. The change in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then back to southerly in the evening suggests complex local circulation, possibly linked to urban heat island effects or nearby atmospheric disturbances.
