Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the midday and afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked drop during the early morning hours, indicating the dissipation of fog, but rebounded significantly in the late evening and overnight, suggesting renewed moisture presence. Air pressure rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly, potentially indicating a change in atmospheric flow patterns. These combined shifts suggest that San Francisco is transitioning from a stable, fog-prone coastal pattern to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled weather regime.
