Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity remained consistently high, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which may contribute to fog formation or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily decreased, signaling the potential approach of a low-pressure system that could bring changing weather conditions. Wind speed remained constant at a gentle level, with wind direction consistently from the northwest, consistent with typical coastal patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics. Together, these indicators point to a stable, cool, and moist marine environment, typical of San Francisco’s foggy mornings, but with a potential shift toward more unsettled conditions as pressure continues to drop.
