Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining slightly in the late afternoon, indicating the influence of marine air intrusion. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable drop in the early hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system or a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds increased steadily through the night and into the morning, with a shift in wind direction from west to north and then to the west-southwest, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These conditions suggest a transition toward a more maritime, potentially foggy and cooler environment, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate during transitional periods.
