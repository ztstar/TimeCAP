Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, especially during the afternoon and early evening hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of saturation, suggesting prolonged moisture presence that contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure gradually declined, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with brief periods of calm and shifting wind directions, including southerly and westerly flows, which may have facilitated moisture transport into the region. These combined factors point to a developing weather pattern conducive to thunderstorm development later in the day or overnight.
