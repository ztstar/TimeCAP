Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature coincided with a sharp decline in air pressure, indicating the passage of a strong cold front through the region. Humidity remained near saturation levels early in the period, suggesting saturated air masses that likely contributed to overcast conditions and reduced visibility. Wind speeds were consistently elevated during the initial phase, with strong, easterly to northeasterly flow, which later diminished as the front passed and winds shifted to a more variable, lighter pattern. The sustained low pressure and associated wind shift suggest a developing low-pressure system that may bring continued unsettled weather, including possible precipitation. Overall, the data points to a transition to colder, drier air following the front, which could lead to clearer skies but also increased wind chill in the immediate aftermath.
