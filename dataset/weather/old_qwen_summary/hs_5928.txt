Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before dropping sharply overnight, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by nocturnal radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, reaching near-saturation conditions before declining during the morning hours, suggesting the presence of a moist boundary layer that may have contributed to fog formation. Air pressure exhibited notable fluctuations, with a low-pressure anomaly in the early hours followed by a gradual increase, which may be associated with the passage of a frontal system or localized convection. Wind speeds increased during the late night and early morning, particularly from the east-southeast, aligning with a shift in wind direction that likely brought in moist maritime air. These combined patterns point to a dynamic transition, with the potential for unstable conditions and scattered showers later in the day as moisture continues to accumulate.
