Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable temperature rise during the late afternoon and early evening, followed by a sharp drop in the overnight hours, indicating a significant diurnal swing likely tied to changing atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels steadily increased through the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure declined steadily in the early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to recover, reflecting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased significantly through the evening and early night, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the northeast, consistent with a weakening frontal influence. The return of stronger winds in the early morning hours, now from the northwest, signals the approach of a new air mass, possibly bringing cooler temperatures and clearing skies.
