Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before gradually rising in the morning. Humidity levels surged during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting possible moisture accumulation and the potential for fog or light precipitation. Air pressure declined steadily through the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is consistent with unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, signaling dynamic atmospheric changes. These combined indicators point to a developing weather front, likely bringing overcast skies, increased chances of rain, and cooler conditions in the near term.
