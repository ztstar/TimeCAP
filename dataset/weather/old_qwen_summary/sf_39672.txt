Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed extreme variability, with a sharp spike to saturation in the pre-dawn hours, indicating possible fog formation or condensation, followed by a decline as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall, with a slight dip in the early hours, suggesting a passing low-pressure influence that may have contributed to the increased moisture. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and westerly directions, which could signal the arrival of marine air or a change in synoptic flow. These conditions together suggest a transition from a foggy, stable night to a progressively drier and windier day, potentially clearing skies and improving visibility in the coming hours.
