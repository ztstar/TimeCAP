Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable pressure drop occurred in the early morning, signaling a passing frontal system, followed by a recovery later in the day, indicating dynamic atmospheric changes. Wind patterns shifted dramatically from prevailing northwest winds to strong southerly and easterly flows, suggesting a change in air mass and possible influence from coastal upwelling or a low-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by fog, cooler temperatures, and variable winds, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
