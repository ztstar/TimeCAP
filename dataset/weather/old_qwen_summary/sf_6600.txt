Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning before gradually warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the pre-dawn hours. A notable shift in wind direction occurred around midday, transitioning from a consistent offshore flow to a more variable pattern, suggesting a change in local atmospheric dynamics. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring increased cloudiness or light precipitation in the coming hours. The return of stronger winds in the late afternoon, from the southwest, could signal the onset of a marine layer surge, potentially leading to cooler, more humid conditions overnight.
