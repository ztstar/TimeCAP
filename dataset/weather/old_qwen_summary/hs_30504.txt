Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn hours. A notable increase in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed convective activity. Wind patterns shifted from southwesterly to northeasterly during the night and early morning, then veered toward southeasterly in the afternoon, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. Despite the return of higher wind speeds later in the day, the combination of elevated humidity and stable pressure suggests a reduced likelihood of thunderstorms, though localized fog and damp conditions may persist into the early evening.
