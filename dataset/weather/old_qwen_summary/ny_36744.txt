Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the afternoon, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning, peaking in the late night and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation, which may have impacted visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, then declined slightly in the late afternoon, signaling a possible transition from a high-pressure system to a developing low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable reduction during the morning hours, while wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly, hinting at changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a cold front passage overnight, followed by a gradual warming trend and the potential for increased cloud cover or precipitation later in the day.
