Over the past 24 hours, a notable temperature rise occurred during the afternoon and early evening, suggesting the influence of warming air masses. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours and remained elevated through the night, indicating moist air advection, likely linked to a low-pressure system. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling the approach and passage of a weather front, which may have contributed to the changing conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and eventually easterly, consistent with a developing storm system. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather pattern, potentially bringing precipitation or unstable conditions in the near term.
