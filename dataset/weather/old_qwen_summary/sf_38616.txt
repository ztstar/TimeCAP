Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels showed a marked increase in the late night and early morning, peaking during the same period, suggesting the likelihood of fog formation or low cloud cover. A sharp decrease in air pressure occurred in the early hours, coinciding with a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest, which is often associated with marine air intrusion from the Pacific Ocean. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west-southwest, contributing to the dispersion of moisture and the dissipation of fog. These conditions point to a strong influence of coastal maritime air, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, breezier weather later in the day.
