Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase through the day, indicating a cooling trend overnight and warming later in the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking near saturation during the night and early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight rise in the late afternoon may signal the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely enhancing the feeling of cooler temperatures despite the warming trend. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and then southeast indicates changing atmospheric circulation, possibly heralding a transition in weather patterns that could influence precipitation or temperature stability in the coming hours.
