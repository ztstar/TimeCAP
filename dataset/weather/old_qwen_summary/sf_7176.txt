Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of marine fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting possible approaching weather changes. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning, shifting from a southerly direction to a westerly and then a northerly flow by late evening, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity patterns. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and shifting wind directions points to a dynamic coastal weather system, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions overnight.
