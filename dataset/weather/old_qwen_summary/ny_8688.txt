Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure was observed, particularly in the last 12 hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable weather conditions. Temperature trends show a pronounced cooling during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the day, suggesting a temperature inversion that persisted into the early hours before breaking. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining as temperatures increased, which may have contributed to fog formation during the overnight hours. Wind patterns shifted from a consistent southeasterly direction to a more southerly and then westerly flow, with a notable increase in speed and a change in direction in the final hours, pointing to a change in air mass. Taken together, these indicators suggest the arrival of a dynamic weather front, potentially bringing precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
