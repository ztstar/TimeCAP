Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in air pressure during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual stabilization, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Temperature trends revealed a pronounced cooling period in the early hours, with a subsequent warming phase during the afternoon and evening, likely due to changing air masses. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining steadily, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that has since been displaced. Wind patterns shifted from a southwest to a southeast and later to a southwesterly direction, consistent with a transition in frontal systems and potential for changing weather conditions. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic weather shift, with the potential for clearing skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
