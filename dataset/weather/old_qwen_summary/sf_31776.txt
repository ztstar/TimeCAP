Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures declining significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, then dropped sharply during the midday, indicating a shift toward drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning hours, peaking in the midday, followed by a notable drop in the late afternoon, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds intensified during the early evening, with stronger gusts coming from the west and southwest, likely influenced by offshore flow or a developing low-pressure system. The combination of cooling temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition period in the weather, potentially bringing overcast skies or fog in the coming hours.
