Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night, followed by a steady warming through the day, indicating a transition from nocturnal to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a steady decline, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that may have contributed to increased cloud cover or potential for precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, reflecting a persistent high-pressure system that likely suppressed storm development. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southeast to more southerly and then eastward, indicating a possible change in airflow patterns associated with a developing boundary. Taken together, these trends suggest a stable, humid atmosphere with potential for isolated afternoon showers, especially as daytime heating intensifies later in the day.
