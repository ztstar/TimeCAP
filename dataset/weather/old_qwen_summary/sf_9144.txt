Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a normal diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained high during the early and late hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the presence of fog or low-level moisture, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure rose steadily through the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable, dry conditions later in the day. Wind speeds were minimal overnight and in the morning, with stronger winds emerging in the late afternoon, particularly from the southeast and south, potentially signaling a shift in local wind patterns. These conditions point to a transition from a foggy, damp morning to a clearer, windier afternoon, consistent with the influence of marine layer dynamics and afternoon heating.
