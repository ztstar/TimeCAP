Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the midday, indicating a period of dry air intrusion, likely due to a shift in wind patterns and clearing skies. A consistent decrease in atmospheric pressure was observed throughout the night, culminating in a low-pressure system that may have contributed to the weakening of surface winds and the development of fog or low cloud cover. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night and early morning, suggesting stable air conditions, but intensified in the late evening, particularly from the northwest, potentially signaling the arrival of a new air mass. These patterns suggest a transition from a relatively dry, stable period to a more dynamic and potentially unsettled phase, with the potential for increased cloud cover or light precipitation later in the day.
