Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels climbed sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, then intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest and later to the west, potentially indicating changing airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather shift, likely involving the passage of a front, with implications for potential precipitation or storm development later in the day.
