Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels reached near saturation during the early morning hours, remaining consistently high through mid-morning before beginning a slow decrease, which suggests the presence of persistent fog or low clouds that have since started to dissipate. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout most of the period, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling potential stabilization of the atmospheric conditions and a possible weakening of the marine layer. Wind speeds were consistently low, with a notable shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south-southeast during the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a change in local circulation likely associated with the breakdown of the coastal inversion layer. These trends collectively indicate that a dense marine layer, which dominated overnight, has begun to weaken, leading to improving visibility and a transition toward more moderate and stable conditions in the coming hours.
