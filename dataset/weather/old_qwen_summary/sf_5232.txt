Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained high overnight, dropping sharply in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine layer dominance to clearer skies as the sun strengthened. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, stabilizing in the mid-range, which is consistent with the buildup of a high-pressure system enhancing fair weather conditions. Wind activity was subdued during the early morning hours, with calms and light breezes, but intensified in the late afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, signaling a possible shift in near-surface airflow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from foggy, cool conditions to drier and more stable weather, typical of a clearing marine layer under strengthening high pressure.
