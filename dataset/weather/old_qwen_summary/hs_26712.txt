Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before stabilizing, indicating a likely influx of moist air. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the early hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system, which later fluctuated, possibly due to a passing weather front. Wind speeds remained low during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially signaling changing air mass dynamics. These conditions collectively point to a transition period, with increasing instability and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
