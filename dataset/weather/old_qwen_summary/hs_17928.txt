Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining, indicating a shift from a more stable to a drier air mass. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a persistent high-pressure system, which typically brings fair weather. Wind speeds increased steadily during the afternoon and evening, with a consistent southeasterly to easterly direction, potentially signaling the approach of a boundary or moisture-laden air flow. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward more variable conditions, with possible implications for afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
