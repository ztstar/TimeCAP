Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier air. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the early morning, then declined steadily into the late evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were light and variable, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly, consistent with changing airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially signaling the onset of a more unstable or storm-prone period.
