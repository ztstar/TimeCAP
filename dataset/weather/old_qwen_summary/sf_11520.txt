Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic shift, with a sharp increase in the early hours, indicating possible fog formation, followed by a sudden decrease, suggesting clearing skies and drying conditions. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, then began to decline, signaling a potential change in weather systems approaching the region. Wind patterns exhibited inconsistent direction and intermittent calm periods, particularly around dawn, which may have contributed to localized fog accumulation and stagnation of air. These combined factors suggest a transition from foggy, stable conditions to a drier, more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and increasing wind activity later in the day.
