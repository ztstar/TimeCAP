Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and remained persistently high through midday, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with the city’s typical coastal climate. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the morning and early afternoon, peaking just before a sudden drop in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a shifting weather system. Wind speeds were relatively low during the early morning but intensified significantly in the late evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, suggesting an influx of marine air. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure followed by a drop, and increasing wind from the ocean points to a developing coastal weather pattern, potentially bringing fog, cooler temperatures, and possible light precipitation overnight.
