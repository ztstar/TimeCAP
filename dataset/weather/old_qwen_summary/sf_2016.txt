Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually recovering in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with the region’s marine layer. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with stronger gusts in the early morning hours, and wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to northerly and then easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising pressure, and decreasing wind suggests a transition toward drier, more stable weather, potentially breaking up the marine layer and improving visibility in the coming hours.
