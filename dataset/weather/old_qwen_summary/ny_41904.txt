Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend throughout the night, stabilizing at a high level by mid-morning, which typically signals improving weather and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, suggesting a developing or passing weather front. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns implies that the city may be transitioning into a more stable and drier phase, though lingering moisture could lead to patchy fog or drizzle in the early morning hours.
