Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible transition in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds were negligible for most of the day, with brief increases in the evening, particularly from the northwest and west, possibly signaling the approach of a weak weather disturbance. These conditions collectively point to a stable, dry, and mild weather pattern, with little immediate risk of precipitation or severe conditions.
