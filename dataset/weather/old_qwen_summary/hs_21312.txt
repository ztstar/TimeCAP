Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and potential for unstable air masses. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting saturated air conditions that may contribute to fog formation during early morning hours and enhance the potential for thunderstorm development later in the day. Air pressure showed a continuous decline, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, which is a strong indicator of an approaching low-pressure system, possibly linked to a developing storm or frontal boundary. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the day, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the northeast toward the east-southeast, signaling changing circulation patterns and possible inflow of moist, unstable air. These combined factors suggest growing atmospheric instability, raising the likelihood of scattered to widespread thunderstorms, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours.
