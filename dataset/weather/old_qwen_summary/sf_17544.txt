Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of marine fog as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a slight rise during the early morning and a gradual decline in the evening, consistent with a weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds stayed consistently low throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from north-easterly to south-westerly in the late evening, potentially signaling a change in synoptic flow. These conditions point to a transition from a fog-prone, stable coastal environment to a drier, more variable regime, which may influence visibility, local microclimates, and outdoor activities in the region.
