A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a rapid rebound later in the day, indicating the passage of a weather system, likely a low-pressure front. Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, suggesting a cooling trend overnight and a warming pattern in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the midday hours, followed by a sharp increase in the late evening, which may be linked to increased moisture influx or precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a notable reduction in the late evening and early morning, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and eventually to a more northerly flow, consistent with changing pressure gradients. These patterns collectively suggest the influence of a passing frontal system, potentially bringing unstable conditions and a risk of precipitation as the system moves through the region.
