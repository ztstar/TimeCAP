Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking and remaining high through the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a transition from moist marine conditions to drier air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems, though slight drops coincided with periods of increased wind and humidity. Wind speeds were low during the night and early morning, building through the afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in the late hours, driven by shifting wind directions from southerly to northerly and easterly sectors. These changes point to a developing coastal breeze pattern, potentially enhancing fog dissipation and contributing to a more stable and gradually warming atmosphere by morning.
