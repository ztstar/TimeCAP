Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature, with a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking at near saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover that likely contributed to the temperature decline. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, reaching a sustained high, which suggests the influence of a stable high-pressure system that has helped suppress precipitation and maintain clear skies in the morning. Wind speeds were low initially but surged dramatically during the overnight hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest, signaling a change in atmospheric flow. This combination of cooling, high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting winds points to a strong marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, likely resulting in persistent fog and cool conditions through the early morning hours.
