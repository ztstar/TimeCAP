Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, suggesting changing air mass dynamics. Together, these patterns point to a developing weather event, potentially including thunderstorms or heavy rain, as the city remains under the influence of a moist, unstable air mass moving in from the Gulf.
