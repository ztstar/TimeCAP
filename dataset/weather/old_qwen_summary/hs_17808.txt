Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from saturated air to drier conditions, possibly due to a shift in air mass or subsidence. Air pressure showed a consistent, gradual increase throughout the day, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained moderate and relatively steady, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest and back, indicating a change in circulation patterns, potentially linked to a developing surface-level pressure gradient. Overall, the data points to a transitioning weather pattern with cooling nights, increasing stability, and a potential for clearing skies later into the day.
