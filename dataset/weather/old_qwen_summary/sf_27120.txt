Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, sharply dropping in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting a transition from marine layer dominance to clearer skies. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning hours, coinciding with a shift in wind direction and speed, which likely signaled the arrival of a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind patterns evolved from a persistent southerly flow to stronger westerly and southwesterly components in the afternoon, contributing to the dissipation of fog and increased ventilation. These combined factors point to a transition from a cool, foggy, and humid maritime environment toward a drier, warmer, and more stable afternoon, typical of a summer day in the Bay Area.
