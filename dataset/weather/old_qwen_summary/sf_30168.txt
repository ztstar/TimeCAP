Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping during midday, suggesting the influence of fog formation and dissipation typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a marked drop during the pre-dawn hours followed by a recovery, hinting at a passing weather front or shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased substantially during the afternoon, particularly from the west and southwest, aligning with typical onshore breezes that often bring cooler air and fog inland. These combined patterns point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, variable wind conditions, and a shift from stable to more dynamic atmospheric conditions, likely affecting visibility and comfort levels across the city.
