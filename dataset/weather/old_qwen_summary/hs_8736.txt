Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near 100%, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a marked increase starting in the late night, reaching a peak and stabilizing, which suggests the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased gradually through the morning, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly sectors, typical of a developing northerly flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially reducing the likelihood of precipitation in the near term.
