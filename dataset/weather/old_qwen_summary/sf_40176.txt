Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting the passage of a maritime inflow or fog event. Air pressure exhibited a complex pattern, with a notable drop in the early morning, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, followed by a recovery later in the day. Wind speeds were highest during the overnight hours, shifting from westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics and possible influence from coastal upwelling or synoptic-scale wind shifts. These observations collectively point to a dynamic transition period, likely involving marine layer development and dissipation, which is typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic behavior.
