Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, common in the region during cooler periods. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind patterns, hinting at an approaching weather system or change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, with calm conditions likely contributing to fog formation, while increased wind activity later in the day may indicate a break in the marine layer. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and shifting wind directions points to a transition period, potentially leading to clearer skies or light precipitation depending on the evolution of the incoming system.
