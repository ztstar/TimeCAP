Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking just before dawn, which is typical of marine layer formation, before dropping sharply in the afternoon as the fog cleared. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then declined steadily into the early morning before a sharp increase late in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather system and possible high-pressure buildup. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and early morning, weakened during midday, and then intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and finally easterly, indicating changing atmospheric flow. These patterns point to a transition from a foggy, stable coastal condition to a drier, windier environment, likely due to a high-pressure ridge building in, which may lead to clearer skies and warmer temperatures in the coming hours.
