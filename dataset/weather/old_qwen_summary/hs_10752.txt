Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which contributed to a noticeable dampness and reduced comfort. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and later westerly, suggesting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions collectively point to the potential for developing storms or showers later in the day, especially given the combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind activity.
