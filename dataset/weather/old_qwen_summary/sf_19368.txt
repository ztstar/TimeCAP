Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced persistently high humidity levels, indicating saturated air conditions that contributed to a thick, damp atmosphere. Temperature remained relatively stable with a slight evening increase, suggesting minimal diurnal variation typical of coastal fog influence. Air pressure steadily rose, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that likely brought improving conditions and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds decreased significantly in the latter half of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more northeasterly, indicating a change in prevailing airflow patterns. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, maritime-influenced regime toward clearer, more stable weather as the high-pressure system consolidates.
