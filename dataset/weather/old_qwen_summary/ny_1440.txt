Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold nighttime period with warming trends during daylight hours. Humidity levels remained relatively stable during the early morning before spiking significantly in the late night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of moist air, possibly from a developing low-pressure system. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, dropping to near calm in the early hours before increasing again in the afternoon, with wind direction shifting from west-southwest to northeast, hinting at a change in air mass. Taken together, these trends suggest a transition from a cold, moist, and variable wind regime to a drier, more stable, and warming atmosphere, likely leading to improving weather conditions in the near term.
