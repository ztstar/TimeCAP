Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by nocturnal radiative loss. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, with a sharp decline during midday, suggesting a possible break in moist air mass or a shift in air circulation. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the late evening and early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer conditions and stable weather. Wind speeds remained low and light throughout most of the period, but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, hinting at a change in synoptic-scale flow. These patterns collectively suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially reducing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms but also increasing the likelihood of a more comfortable, less humid environment in the coming hours.
