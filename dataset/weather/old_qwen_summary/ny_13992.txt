Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase likely due to clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning, peaking near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, potentially reducing visibility and contributing to a damp, chilly feel. A notable decrease in air pressure during the night, particularly around the early morning hours, was accompanied by a strong wind event, signaling the passage of a weather front or storm system through the region. Wind speeds increased substantially during this period, with a shift in wind direction indicating a change in air mass, likely bringing in cooler, moister air from a different quadrant. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, with the potential for precipitation or unstable conditions in the near future.
