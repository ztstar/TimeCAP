Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high during nighttime and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, particularly in the early hours, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A notable increase in wind speed occurred during the midday and late afternoon, with strong northwest winds persisting through the evening, consistent with the influence of the prevailing marine layer and offshore flow. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear conditions. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors later in the day may indicate changing atmospheric patterns, potentially influencing the dissipation of fog and the onset of clearer skies in the coming hours.
