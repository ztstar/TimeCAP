Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend likely influenced by clear skies and low wind conditions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation during the coolest part of the night. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase midday, reaching a high point before a sharp decline in the late evening, which may signal the approach of a weather system or change in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with only brief increases, indicating stable atmospheric conditions with limited air mixing. Combined with consistent wind direction from the northeast, the data suggests a relatively calm and stable environment, though the pressure drop late in the period could foreshadow shifting weather patterns in the coming hours.
