Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping to a minimum before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low stratus clouds. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early evening, with gusts from the northwest, later diminishing to calm conditions overnight before picking up again in the late afternoon from the south and southeast. The shift in wind direction and the drop in wind speed during the night suggest a weakening of coastal upslope flow, consistent with a transition toward a more settled weather regime.
