Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a shift from stable, moist conditions to drier, more variable air. A significant drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, culminating in a marked low-pressure system that likely contributed to the changing weather patterns, including increased wind activity. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels from the northwest and west, suggesting the influence of a developing coastal wind event. These combined factors point to a dynamic transition in the local weather, likely driven by a marine layer surge and approaching atmospheric instability, which could lead to overcast skies or light precipitation later in the day.
