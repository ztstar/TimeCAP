Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend began in the early morning hours, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before gradually warming again in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred around mid-morning, with winds strengthening from the northwest and then shifting to the northeast, indicating a change in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, then increased in the morning, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and drier conditions. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind direction suggests a transition toward more stable and pleasant weather in the coming hours.
