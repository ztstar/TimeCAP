Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels showed a sharp spike in the late night and early morning, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air, likely associated with a developing weather system. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise during the midday and into the evening, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that may contribute to clearing skies. Wind speeds increased in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the west and northwest, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. The combination of fluctuating humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggests a dynamic transition in weather conditions, possibly leading to storm development or dissipation depending on further atmospheric interactions.
