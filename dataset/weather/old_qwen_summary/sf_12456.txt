Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler marine layer to a more stable daytime pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture that likely contributed to the cooler conditions. A sharp decline in air pressure occurred in the early morning, accompanied by a temporary increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, pointing to the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. This front appears to have brought brief gusty conditions and changing wind patterns, which may have disrupted the usual coastal breeze regime. The return to higher pressure and calmer winds later in the day suggests the system has moved out, potentially clearing skies and allowing for improved visibility and more stable conditions.
