Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, indicating a high moisture content in the air that may have contributed to increased comfort levels. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast, which may signal the onset of a developing weather disturbance. These combined patterns point to a transition in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for afternoon or evening thunderstorms.
