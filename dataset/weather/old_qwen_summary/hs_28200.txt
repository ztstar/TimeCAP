Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable rise in temperature, particularly during midday and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, which suggests the presence of moist air and increases the potential for localized thunderstorms or heavy rainfall. Air pressure showed a significant drop during the early morning hours, followed by a brief recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then southeasterly, with a reduction in speed during the late afternoon, potentially indicating a calming of convective activity. These combined factors point to a transition period that could lead to scattered or isolated storms later in the day, especially given the high moisture content and unstable air.
