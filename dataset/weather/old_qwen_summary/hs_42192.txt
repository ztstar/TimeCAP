Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early hours, peaking in the overnight period before dropping sharply during the midday, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations suggesting a lack of strong frontal systems passing through. Wind speeds increased in the evening and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, hinting at changing circulation patterns. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic boundary layer influenced by diurnal heating and a possible influence from a weakening sea breeze or outflow boundary, potentially setting the stage for isolated afternoon thunderstorms.
