Over the past 24 hours, a persistent marine layer developed overnight, bringing prolonged high humidity and cool temperatures, particularly during the early morning hours. A notable drop in temperature occurred around midnight, followed by a gradual warming trend in the late afternoon, indicating the breakdown of the marine layer. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity, though slight drops coincided with increased wind activity. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the early morning hours, while wind direction shifted from southwest to more variable, hinting at the influence of local topography and changing pressure gradients. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and shifting winds suggests continued fog and overcast conditions, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential for lingering fog into the early evening.
