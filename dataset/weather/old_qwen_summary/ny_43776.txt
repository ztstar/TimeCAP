Temperatures showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a low before stabilizing and rising slightly in the late afternoon, indicating a stabilizing thermal pattern. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests moisture accumulation likely due to nighttime cooling and reduced air mixing. Air pressure steadily rose over the 24-hour period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northeasterly, potentially indicating the influence of a developing or passing frontal boundary. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and changing wind direction suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition to drier and more settled air by the next day.
