Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase succeeded by daytime recovery. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature minimum. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, reflecting steady high-pressure influence, which typically brings clear skies and calm conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate overnight but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with directional shifts indicating dynamic airflow changes possibly linked to a passing front. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition period with lingering moisture and strengthening winds, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions in the coming hours.
