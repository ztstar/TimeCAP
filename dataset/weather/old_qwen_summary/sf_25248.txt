Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the daytime, suggesting drier air and reduced cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature fluctuations. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase overnight followed by a minor drop in the evening, indicating a period of atmospheric stability with limited storm activity. Wind speeds increased notably during the evening and nighttime hours, particularly from the southwest and west directions, which may have brought in cooler marine air from the Pacific Ocean. The consistent wind direction from the west-southwest during peak wind periods suggests a strong influence of coastal upwelling and onshore flow, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, reinforcing the cool, breezy conditions.
