Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which indicates a significant moisture presence in the atmosphere—likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline during the early to mid-morning hours, suggesting an approaching low-pressure system, followed by a recovery later in the day. Wind speeds increased significantly through the night, reaching peak intensity in the early morning before tapering off, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more westerly, consistent with marine air inflow. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with strong potential for foggy and cool conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
