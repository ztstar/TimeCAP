Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before declining sharply in the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the night, followed by a slight decrease in the late morning and early afternoon, indicative of a developing weather system. Wind activity intensified during the early morning and late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly, reflecting dynamic circulation changes. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a marine layer, likely bringing fog and cooler conditions overnight, with a potential for clearing skies and improved visibility in the coming hours.
