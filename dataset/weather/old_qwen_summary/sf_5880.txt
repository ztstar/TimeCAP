Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, indicating the presence of fog or dense low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooling effect. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midday, followed by fluctuating readings, suggesting the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system through the region. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, with stronger gusts from the southwest and south, potentially aiding in the mixing of cooler marine air inland. The combination of high humidity, variable wind direction, and pressure changes points to a dynamic coastal weather pattern, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimates influenced by oceanic inflows and topographic effects.
