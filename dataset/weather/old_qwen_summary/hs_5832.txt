Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking during the early morning and remaining elevated before declining through the midday, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling the potential influence of a weak high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then southeasterly, consistent with the development of a sea breeze or frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest the potential for isolated thunderstorms in the evening, particularly as warm, moist air continued to accumulate beneath a stabilizing upper-level ridge.
