Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight increases, indicating a persistent high-pressure influence that suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light during the night but intensified in the late afternoon and early evening, with shifts in wind direction suggesting changing local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal marine layer pattern, with fog and cool temperatures dominating overnight and clearing gradually as winds shift and pressure stabilizes.
