Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels spiked during the overnight and early morning periods, reaching near-saturation conditions, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decline toward the end of the period, consistent with a weakening high-pressure system or approaching weather front. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to more westerly and then to a variable direction in the late evening, with reduced speeds, indicating diminishing synoptic forcing. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period, possibly leading to unstable air masses and an increased likelihood of isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
