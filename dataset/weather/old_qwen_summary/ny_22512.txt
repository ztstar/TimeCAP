Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced increase in the afternoon, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before steadily decreasing through the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with the warming air. Air pressure exhibited a notable spike in the late morning and early afternoon, followed by a gradual decline, which may signal the approach of a weather front or changing atmospheric conditions.
