Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked during the early hours before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of a moist air mass and the arrival of drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer and more stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with sustained strong gusts from a consistent direction, likely driven by a developing pressure gradient. These changes collectively point to the passage of a cold front followed by the establishment of a more stable, drier, and windy regime—conditions conducive to clearing skies and cooler, crisp air in the coming hours.
