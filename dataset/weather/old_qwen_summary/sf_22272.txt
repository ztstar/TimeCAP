Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply after midnight, reaching saturation and remaining near 100% throughout the early morning hours, indicating favorable conditions for fog formation. A persistent low-pressure system was evident from the declining air pressure, particularly in the final hours, suggesting an ongoing influence of coastal weather dynamics. Winds remained light and variable during the night but shifted to a more consistent southerly direction in the early morning, aligning with typical marine layer patterns. The combination of saturated air, decreasing pressure, and stable wind direction points to a prolonged marine layer event, likely resulting in dense fog and cool, damp conditions through the night and into the next day.
