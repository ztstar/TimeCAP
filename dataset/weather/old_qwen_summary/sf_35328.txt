Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a sustained period of cool temperatures, with a notable drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon. Humidity remained near saturation through the night and early morning, indicating persistent fog or low cloud cover, which began to clear as temperatures rose and humidity decreased in the late morning. Air pressure showed a slight decline toward the end of the period, suggesting a possible shift in weather patterns, though it remained relatively stable overall. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to westerly component early on that shifted to more variable directions later, possibly reflecting changes in local circulation. These conditions point to a typical marine layer pattern, with foggy, cool mornings giving way to clearer, slightly warmer afternoons—characteristic of San Francisco’s microclimate.
