Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. A notable pressure increase around midday suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, likely bringing clearer skies and stable conditions in the coming hours. Wind speeds remained minimal during the early morning hours, indicating calm conditions conducive to fog formation, while winds picked up in the late afternoon, possibly signaling a shift in air mass. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then to easterly suggests changing atmospheric dynamics, potentially influencing coastal air patterns and marine layer behavior.
