Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before stabilizing, indicating a shift toward more saturated air, which may contribute to fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp increase later in the day, suggesting the passage of a weather system that brought changing conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more westerly and northerly, likely due to a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, possibly involving the influence of coastal upwelling and a passing frontal system, which may result in variable conditions including fog, cooler temperatures, and gusty winds in the coming hours.
