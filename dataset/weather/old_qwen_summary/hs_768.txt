Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels spiked dramatically overnight, reaching saturation multiple times, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, likely due to the cooling air near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning before a gradual decline in the late afternoon, signaling a possible shift in weather systems approaching the region. Wind activity was minimal during the night, with intermittent gusts in the early morning and late afternoon, particularly from the south and southwest, which may have contributed to the mixing of moisture and the subsequent fog development. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating winds, and a weakening pressure gradient points to a transitional weather phase, potentially setting the stage for isolated thunderstorms later in the day.
