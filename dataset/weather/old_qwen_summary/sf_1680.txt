Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining during midday, suggesting a shift in moisture content likely linked to marine influence. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with notable increases in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions from southerly to easterly, which may signal the onset of a coastal breeze or a change in local circulation. The combination of rising pressure, moderate wind activity, and decreasing humidity suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition toward drier and more stable air in the coming hours.
