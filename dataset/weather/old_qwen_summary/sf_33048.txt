Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were initially high, dropped significantly during midday, and then rose again in the late evening, indicating a possible shift in air mass. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late afternoon, with strong southerly and westerly gusts, which likely contributed to the cooling and humidity fluctuations. The combination of falling pressure, shifting wind directions, and rising humidity points to an active atmospheric transition, potentially signaling the onset of fog or overcast conditions later in the night.
