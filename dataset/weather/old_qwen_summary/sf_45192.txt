The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has been exceptionally stable, with no variation in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction across all hourly measurements. This persistent uniformity suggests the presence of a strong, unchanging high-pressure system dominating the region, which typically brings clear skies and calm conditions. The consistently low humidity indicates dry air, which can increase fire risk and contribute to rapid temperature changes when sunlight is present. The light, steady wind from a southeasterly direction implies limited atmospheric mixing, reinforcing the stability of the air mass and suppressing the development of clouds or precipitation. Overall, the conditions point to a prolonged period of dry, stable weather with minimal chance of storms or significant change in the immediate forecast.
