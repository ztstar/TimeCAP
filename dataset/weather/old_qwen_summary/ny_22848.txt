Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent decline through the night, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime heating. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, remaining high before a significant drop in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely linked to increasing temperatures and changing wind patterns. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before rebounding slightly late in the day, pointing to the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly and then westerly, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow associated with the low-pressure system. These combined trends suggest a dynamic weather pattern, likely bringing a shift in conditions such as clearing skies and potentially unsettled weather later in the day.
