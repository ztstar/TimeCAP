Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking in the early dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, typical of the city’s coastal microclimate. A significant spike in air pressure occurred during the same period, indicating the influence of a strong high-pressure system that likely contributed to the stabilization and clearing of fog. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, suggesting the onset of a marine layer surge or onshore flow. The combination of high humidity, elevated pressure, and shifting wind patterns points to a transition from foggy, damp conditions to clearer, cooler weather later in the day.
