Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline overnight, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day, indicating a transition from a cold night to a milder afternoon. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting a drying of the lower atmosphere, before stabilizing and rising again in the late afternoon, which may contribute to potential fog or low clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the early morning, followed by a minor fluctuation, consistent with a passing high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified in the mid-afternoon, particularly in the evening, with a strong gust in the final hours, likely driven by a shift in local wind direction from the west-southwest to the northeast. The combination of warming temperatures, increasing humidity, and elevated wind speeds suggests the potential for unsettled conditions, including possible precipitation or storm development later in the evening.
