Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle typical of the region’s microclimate. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before dropping in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine layer development and subsequent breakup. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a return to higher values later in the day, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought overcast conditions and light precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight and early morning periods, with stronger gusts from the southwest and later from the east-southeast, likely contributing to the mixing of the marine layer and the dispersion of fog. The shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly in the late afternoon and evening points to a change in atmospheric flow, potentially indicating the arrival of a new air mass and a transition toward clearer skies and more stable conditions.
