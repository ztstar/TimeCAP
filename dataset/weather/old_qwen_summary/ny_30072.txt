Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the day, indicating a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure exhibited a notable increase mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and likely contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a shift to more variable and stronger winds in the late afternoon, accompanied by a dramatic change in wind direction from westerly to southerly and easterly. These combined trends point to the passage of a weather front, with cooler, moister air preceding a drier, more stable high-pressure regime, likely leading to improving conditions and clearer skies in the immediate forecast.
