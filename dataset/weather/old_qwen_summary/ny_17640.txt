Over the past 24 hours, a gradual warming trend was observed, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating a shift toward more stable and milder conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly in the early morning, peaked in the mid-morning, and then declined steadily through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a drying trend. Air pressure showed a consistent decline through the early to mid-day, followed by a slight recovery, which may indicate the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from a southerly to southwesterly direction, consistent with an approaching atmospheric disturbance. These combined patterns suggest the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly including increased cloud cover or precipitation in the near term.
