Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the late afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or low cloud cover, which is consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. A notable shift in wind patterns occurred in the early hours, with strong west-to-southwest winds giving way to near-calm conditions before a resurgence in the evening, suggesting the influence of a shifting pressure gradient. The air pressure showed a slight decline during the night, followed by stabilization, which may indicate the passage of a weak weather system or the influence of marine layer dynamics. Together, these indicators suggest the presence of a persistent marine layer that contributed to cool, foggy conditions overnight and likely influenced visibility and comfort throughout the day.
