Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a persistent period of high humidity, peaking at saturation levels during the overnight and early morning hours, indicating strong moisture availability in the atmosphere. Temperature trends reveal a notable cooling phase followed by a gradual warming, with the lowest readings occurring in the early morning hours and a steady rise through the afternoon, suggesting a transition from night-time inversions to daytime heating. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief spike in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more northerly, signaling a change in local airflow patterns. These combined factors point to the dissipation of fog and low clouds, with improving visibility and a likely transition to more settled, sunnier conditions in the coming hours.
