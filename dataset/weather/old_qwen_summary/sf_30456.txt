Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility. A series of pressure fluctuations, including a sharp drop followed by a rebound, suggest the passage of a low-pressure system, possibly bringing unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified overnight, particularly from the southwest and south, with sustained gusts likely enhancing coastal cooling and contributing to the foggy conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast in the late afternoon indicates a change in airflow, potentially signaling the approach of a new weather pattern.
