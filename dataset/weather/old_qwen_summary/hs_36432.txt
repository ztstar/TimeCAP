Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating warming conditions, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning and midday, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of moist air. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to recover, which is often associated with the passage of a weather front or storm system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts increasing significantly and wind direction shifting from southerly to more westerly and then southeasterly, indicating changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest the influence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather, including scattered showers or thunderstorms, to the region in the near term.
