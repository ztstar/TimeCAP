Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a strong cooling trend likely driven by changing air masses. Humidity levels fluctuated notably, peaking in the early hours and then sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a dry front that reduced moisture content in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a sustained high, which typically signals improving weather and the arrival of stable, high-pressure conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the early morning hours before subsiding, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the southeast, indicating a change in circulation patterns consistent with a developing high-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer, drier, and more stable conditions in New York City, likely resulting in reduced cloud cover and minimal precipitation risk in the near term.
