Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, reaching saturation in the predawn hours before declining during the day, indicating a period of high moisture content that may have contributed to fog or mist. Air pressure exhibited a steady decline through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with a complete calm at one point, but increased noticeably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northerly, which may signal a changing frontal influence. These combined patterns point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for possible afternoon thunderstorms or a shift in air masses.
