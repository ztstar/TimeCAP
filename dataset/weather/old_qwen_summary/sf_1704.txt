Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through midday, indicating a strong moisture buildup likely driven by marine influence. A consistent decline in air pressure throughout the night and early morning suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have contributed to the increased cloud cover and damp conditions. Wind activity was minimal during the pre-dawn hours but intensified in the afternoon, shifting from westerly to more southerly and then easterly directions, signaling changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition period with potential for fog, drizzle, or light precipitation, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
