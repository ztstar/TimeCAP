Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night before rebounding slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed marked variability, with periods of very dry air alternating with episodes of high moisture, particularly during the early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with unsettled weather and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southeasterly, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, likely bringing the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
