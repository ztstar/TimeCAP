Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual回升 through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler to warmer conditions. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the early hours, dropping significantly in the midday and continuing to decrease into the evening, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a notable rise in the late afternoon, peaking before declining slightly, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, potentially associated with a developing frontal boundary. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to easterly suggests changing air mass dynamics, possibly leading to unsettled conditions later in the evening.
