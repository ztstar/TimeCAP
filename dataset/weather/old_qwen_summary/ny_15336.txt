Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual increase, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by daytime solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning hours before dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting a shift toward drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the early and mid-day, followed by a slight decline in the late evening, which may indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late evening and overnight hours, accompanied by a change in wind direction that hints at a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a humid, stable air mass to a drier, more dynamic one, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions in the coming hours.
