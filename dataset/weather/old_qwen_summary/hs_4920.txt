Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady nocturnal cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours and declined significantly through the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, stabilizing at a high-pressure ridge, which typically brings clear and stable conditions. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with a strong surge in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at a possible cold front influence. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and strong northerly winds suggests improving weather conditions and a potential end to any recent unsettled pattern.
