Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked temperature rise during the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained near saturation through the early morning hours before sharply declining in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend following a period of sustained moisture. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, peaking in the midday, which typically signals the approach or presence of stable high-pressure conditions. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to westerly, potentially indicating the influence of a developing surface-level circulation or frontal passage. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stable overnight period to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, with implications for potential afternoon thunderstorm development later in the day.
