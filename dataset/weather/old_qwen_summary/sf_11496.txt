Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late afternoon. A notable shift in humidity occurred around dawn, with a sharp increase followed by a return to lower levels, suggesting the influence of fog or low-level moisture intrusion. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the morning and midday, peaking in the afternoon before a sudden drop in the late evening, which may indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained minimal except for a brief but strong surge late in the period, accompanied by a change in wind direction from southerly to northerly, potentially signaling a shift in air mass. These combined indicators suggest a transition from stable, fog-prone conditions to more variable and potentially unsettled weather, with implications for visibility and local microclimates.
