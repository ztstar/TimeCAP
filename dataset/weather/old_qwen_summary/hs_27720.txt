Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping to a low point in the early morning hours before gradually warming again. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel. Air pressure showed brief fluctuations, with a sharp increase followed by a steady decline, indicating possible changes in atmospheric stability and the influence of shifting weather systems. Wind patterns were variable, with shifts in direction suggesting the passage of small-scale weather features, while sustained moderate speeds suggest some atmospheric mixing. These combined conditions point to a transition period, potentially increasing the risk of localized convective activity later in the day.
