Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rebounding in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp decline in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a coastal fog cycle that likely dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but declined notably in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions that may precede changing weather. Wind speeds increased steadily in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest, consistent with a strengthening onshore flow that often accompanies fog and cool marine air intrusions. The wind direction transitioned from southerly to predominantly westerly and then to northerly, reinforcing the presence of a coastal wind pattern typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, which can influence visibility, temperature, and overall comfort.
