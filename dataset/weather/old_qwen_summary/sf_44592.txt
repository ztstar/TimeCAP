Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable meteorological conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent temperature indicates a lack of major air mass changes, suggesting a stable atmospheric layer that suppresses convection and cloud development. Low humidity levels point to dry air, which may increase fire risk and contribute to discomfort, especially during daylight hours. The steady wind from the southeast has maintained a gentle but persistent flow, which could influence the movement of marine fog if conditions shift. Overall, the absence of variability implies a prolonged period of calm, dry weather, typical of a high-pressure ridge influence over the region.
