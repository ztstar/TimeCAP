Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog formation, consistent with the city’s coastal climate. A sustained drop in air pressure, particularly from mid-morning onward, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially bringing increased cloud cover and the chance of precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly offshore to onshore in the late evening, with stronger winds from the southeast, which may facilitate the inland movement of marine air and further fog persistence. Together, these indicators point to a transition toward cooler, foggy conditions with a growing risk of light rain, especially in the coastal and low-lying areas.
