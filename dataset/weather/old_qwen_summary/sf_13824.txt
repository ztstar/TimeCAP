Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly during the day, suggesting the presence of marine fog or low cloud cover that formed during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight upward trend in the latter half, which may signal the approach of a high-pressure system bringing clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase in the late evening, while wind direction shifted from the southwest to the west and northwest, consistent with onshore flow typical of San Francisco’s microclimate. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a foggy, cool, and moist overnight period to a drier, more stable, and slightly warmer afternoon—characteristic of a typical San Francisco coastal weather pattern.
