Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in air pressure, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Temperatures remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting increasing maritime influence and potential for fog or drizzle. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the late night and early morning, which supports the likelihood of fog formation, typical for the city’s microclimate. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with strong southeasterly to easterly winds developing, likely enhancing coastal ventilation and contributing to cooler conditions. These combined factors point to a transition toward more dynamic and potentially overcast or rainy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas.
