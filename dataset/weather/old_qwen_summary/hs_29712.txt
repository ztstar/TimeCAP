Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and into the early morning, indicating saturated conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, which is often associated with approaching storm systems or frontal activity. Wind patterns shifted significantly, with a transition from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, suggesting a change in air mass and potential for instability. These combined indicators point to a dynamic atmospheric environment, possibly setting the stage for thunderstorm development or a shift in weather conditions in the near term.
