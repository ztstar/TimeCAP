Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, peaking during the early hours, suggesting the arrival of moist air, likely associated with marine layer formation. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred in the early morning, followed by a steady rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds increased substantially during the night and early morning, with strong, shifting winds from the south and southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling and onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern characterized by cool, foggy mornings and improving conditions later in the day, with potential for clearer skies and stronger breezes in the afternoon.
