Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, likely bringing unsettled weather to the city. Temperature trends show a gradual warming through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling slightly overnight, suggesting the influence of changing air masses. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early evening, reaching near-saturated conditions, which increases the likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds intensified notably in the final hours, with strong gusts from the west and southwest, consistent with frontal passage and increasing storm activity. Combined with shifting wind directions from southerly to westerly and northerly, these patterns suggest an active weather front moving through, increasing the risk of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
