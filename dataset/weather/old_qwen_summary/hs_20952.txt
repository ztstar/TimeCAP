Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose sharply and remained near saturation, creating a persistently muggy environment conducive to condensation and potential precipitation. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions, though not yet fully dominant. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to more easterly, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition period where lingering moisture and cooling may lead to isolated showers or thunderstorms, especially in the late evening hours.
