Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nocturnal cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a stable diurnal cycle influenced by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels exhibited sharp fluctuations, peaking during early morning hours and dropping significantly in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of fog dissipation and possible offshore air advection. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a brief increase followed by a drop indicates the passage of a weak weather system, possibly associated with a shifting front. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest, aligning with typical afternoon upwelling patterns driven by thermal contrasts along the coast. These combined conditions point to a typical San Francisco weather pattern: cool, foggy mornings transitioning into clearer, warmer afternoons, with wind patterns reinforcing marine layer behavior.
