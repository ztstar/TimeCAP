A significant temperature drop occurred during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear cooling trend followed by stabilization. Humidity levels steadily increased through the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night, which suggests moisture accumulation likely contributed to near-surface fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, with calm conditions prevailing in the early morning, but increased significantly in the late evening, likely due to the developing pressure gradient. Wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the approaching frontal system.
