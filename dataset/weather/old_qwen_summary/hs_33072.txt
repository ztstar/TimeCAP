Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the day, suggesting the dissipation of nocturnal moisture and the onset of drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no significant low-pressure systems or storms, which points to generally fair weather conditions. Wind patterns were variable, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly flows in the late night and early morning, followed by stronger, more erratic winds in the afternoon—possibly due to localized convection. These combined trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, warming day, with increasing wind activity that could enhance heat dissipation and potentially influence afternoon thunderstorm development.
