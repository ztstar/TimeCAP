Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating the influence of a passing cold front. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning, which contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, particularly during the overnight hours. Air pressure dropped steadily throughout the night and into the early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the recent weather changes. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the afternoon and evening, shifting from southerly to westerly and then easterly directions, suggesting dynamic air mass movement associated with the front. These combined conditions point to a transitional weather pattern with potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms as moisture-laden air continues to interact with the residual frontal boundary.
