Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night and early morning before showing a slight recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog that persisted through the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, reaching a minimum and indicating the influence of a low-pressure system that may have driven the fog and damp conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief bursts of stronger winds in the late night and late afternoon, while wind direction shifted broadly from west to north and then to the northeast, suggesting changing airflow patterns consistent with coastal dynamics. These conditions together point to a typical marine layer event, which is common in San Francisco during this season, bringing cool, moist air and reduced visibility, particularly in the early morning hours.
