Over the past 24 hours, a marked temperature decline occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely driven by clear skies and cooling overnight. Humidity levels rose sharply in the middle of the night, reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or dew formation, consistent with the observed drop in wind speed and calm conditions. A notable pressure increase in the early morning hours, followed by a sharp drop later in the day, points to the passage of a weather front, potentially signaling a shift in conditions. Wind patterns showed a transition from light, variable flows to a brief period of stronger, more consistent winds, possibly associated with the front’s influence. These combined factors suggest a dynamic shift in the atmosphere, with potential for changing weather—possibly including precipitation or cloud cover—later in the day.
