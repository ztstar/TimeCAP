Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before decreasing as temperatures increased, indicating a shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Air pressure showed a consistent increase throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced storm potential. Wind speeds remained generally moderate, with a stable southerly to easterly flow that transitioned toward a more easterly direction by late evening, consistent with a prevailing onshore breeze. These patterns point to a developing daytime heating cycle under a relatively stable high-pressure regime, which may lead to comfortable conditions during the day but increasing humidity overnight.
