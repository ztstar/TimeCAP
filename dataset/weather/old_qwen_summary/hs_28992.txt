Temperature trends indicate a nighttime cooling phase followed by a gradual warming through the early morning and into the afternoon, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before dropping sharply, which may signal the onset of a drying trend. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the night, with a notable spike mid-morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a brief strengthening in the late afternoon before subsiding again, consistent with reduced atmospheric mixing. Wind direction shifted dramatically from westerly to southerly during midday, possibly reflecting a change in air mass, which could influence humidity and temperature patterns in the coming hours.
