Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar exposure and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, reaching near saturation, which contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility in the early part of the day. A consistent decline in air pressure suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may be associated with unsettled weather and the potential for precipitation later in the day. Wind speeds remained generally low except during the late afternoon and early evening, when brief bursts of stronger wind coincided with shifts in wind direction, signaling possible frontal passage. These combined indicators point to a transition in weather patterns, with increasing instability and the likelihood of developing storms or showers in the coming hours.
