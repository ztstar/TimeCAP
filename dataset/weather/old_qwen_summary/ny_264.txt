A significant temperature drop occurred in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nocturnal cooling event likely associated with clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of a moisture-laden air mass that may have contributed to fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, signaling the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and improving weather conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, indicating a change in air flow possibly linked to a frontal passage. These combined trends suggest a transition from a damp, cooler night to a drier, more stable day, with improving conditions expected in the near term.
