Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially during the night and early morning, likely contributing to fog formation. Air pressure showed alternating increases and decreases, with a sustained low-pressure period in the early morning suggesting possible unstable conditions and a shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with frequent calm periods, although directional shifts—particularly from westerly to southerly and easterly—indicate changing airflow patterns, possibly linked to coastal influences. These combined factors suggest a transition from foggy, damp conditions to a clearer, warming trajectory later in the day, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate dynamics.
