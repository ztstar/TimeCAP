Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a clear overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure rose sharply during the early morning, signaling the approach and passage of a strong high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds decreased during the night and remained light in the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. The combination of rising pressure, increasing humidity, and shifting winds points to a transition toward more stable, potentially overcast conditions with a slight risk of drizzle later in the day.
