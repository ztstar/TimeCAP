Temperature showed a steady rise through the night, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining, indicating a warming trend followed by cooling. Humidity increased significantly during the early morning hours, reaching saturation by the late night, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase in the afternoon that may signal the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were low during the early morning but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of rising humidity, decreasing temperatures, and increasing wind suggests a transition toward potentially unsettled weather conditions.
