- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a steady increase throughout the night and early morning, peaking sharply in the late morning before declining abruptly in the late afternoon. A significant anomaly occurred around the 23rd hour, where humidity dropped to a notably low level, followed by a rapid rebound, suggesting a possible weather front or localized atmospheric change. This pattern indicates a dynamic diurnal cycle with a strong overnight buildup, potentially signaling the approach of a storm system or shifting air mass in the region.
- Air Pressure (hPa): Air pressure has exhibited a sustained downward trend over the past 24 hours, with a significant drop occurring in the final hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system. The prolonged period of fluctuating values around 1022–1023 hPa was followed by a rapid decline, culminating in a sharp decrease to the lowest recorded level, which is characteristic of impending stormy or unsettled weather. This behavior suggests increasing atmospheric instability, likely associated with inclement weather such as rain or storms, warranting attention for public safety and operational planning.
- Temperature (Kelvin): The temperature exhibited a steady decline during the initial phase, followed by a pronounced increase, peaking in the latter half of the observation period, indicating a significant warming trend. A notable anomaly occurred in the early hours with a sharp drop, suggesting possible nocturnal cooling or a temporary atmospheric disturbance. The sustained high values toward the end imply a strong thermal buildup, potentially signaling the onset of a warmer period with implications for urban heat management and energy demand.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a sustained period of moderate levels followed by a notable drop to near-zero, indicating a temporary lull in atmospheric movement. This was subsequently interrupted by a sharp increase to elevated levels, suggesting the arrival of a gusty or turbulent air mass. The intermittent return to low values after peak activity implies possible fluctuating pressure systems or localized wind shear affecting the region.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Over the past 24 hours, wind direction exhibited a dominant shift from northeasterly to southerly and then to westerly sectors, indicating a significant change in atmospheric flow. A prolonged period of consistent wind from a similar quadrant suggests stable conditions, followed by a sharp transition toward the southwest, likely signaling the passage of a weather front. This abrupt shift, especially the sudden change to a westerly direction, may reflect dynamic synoptic-scale influences, potentially heralding changing weather conditions such as temperature shifts or precipitation onset.
