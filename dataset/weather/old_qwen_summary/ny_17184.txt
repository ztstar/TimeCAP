Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, suggesting condensation or fog formation, which likely contributed to a damp feel in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems passing through, consistent with mostly calm weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and eventually northerly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a relatively stable, humid overnight period to a drier, breezier evening, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
