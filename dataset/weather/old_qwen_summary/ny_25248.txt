Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline overnight followed by a gradual rise during the day, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase and a warming trend as daylight progressed. Humidity levels exhibited marked fluctuations, with multiple spikes during early morning and late evening hours, suggesting the influence of localized moisture sources or passing cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but declined steadily in the afternoon, signaling a potential shift in weather patterns consistent with an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly wind directions, which may indicate the onset of a change in air mass. Combined, these trends suggest a transition toward less stable weather, with potential for precipitation later in the day.
