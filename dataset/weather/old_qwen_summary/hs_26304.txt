Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic spike overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, indicating a possible passage of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure exhibited a brief but significant increase mid-evening, suggesting the influence of a passing high-pressure system, though it later declined, hinting at potential instability. Wind speeds surged unexpectedly during the night, particularly in the early hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, which may signal a change in synoptic conditions. These combined fluctuations point to a dynamic atmospheric environment, with potential for developing convective activity as temperatures rise and moisture levels remain elevated.
