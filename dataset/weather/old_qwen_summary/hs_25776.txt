Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting stable atmospheric moisture and potential for fog or dew formation. A notable decrease in air pressure around midday, followed by a recovery, signals the passage of a weather system, possibly associated with a weakening front or low-pressure disturbance. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and northerly, hinting at changing synoptic-scale flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, with lingering moisture and instability potentially supporting the development of afternoon showers or thunderstorms.
