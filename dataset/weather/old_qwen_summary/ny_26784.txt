Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Humidity levels surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, then dropping sharply in the afternoon before rebounding in the evening, suggesting a possible shift in air mass or moisture influx. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with a marked peak in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from west-southwest to northeast, indicating changing circulation patterns possibly associated with a frontal passage. These combined trends point to a transition from a more humid, cooler overnight regime to a drier, more stable afternoon, with potential for improving conditions later in the day.
