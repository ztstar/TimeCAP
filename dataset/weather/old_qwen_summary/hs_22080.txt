Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking near saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or reduced visibility during early morning hours. Air pressure steadily increased, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly over the course of the day, suggesting a change in air mass flow. These patterns point to a transition toward more stable and potentially clearer conditions, though lingering high humidity may lead to a muggy feel even as temperatures moderate.
