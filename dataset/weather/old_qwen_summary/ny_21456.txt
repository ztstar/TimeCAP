Temperature has shown a steady decline during the night, followed by a gradual recovery in the morning, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity remained high throughout the period, decreasing slightly in the early morning hours, which suggests saturated air conditions and a potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before rising steadily in the morning, signaling improving weather and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speed increased significantly during the night and early morning, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, which likely transported moisture and contributed to the cold, damp conditions. The combination of these factors points to a transition from a stable, chilly, and humid environment toward clearer and drier conditions as the day progresses.
