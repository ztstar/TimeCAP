Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, suggesting saturated air conditions that could promote fog or dew formation, before declining sharply during the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight decline in the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the approach of a low-pressure system, which may contribute to unstable weather later. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching higher levels and a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could bring moisture and potential for thunderstorms. These combined trends point to a transition toward more humid and unstable conditions, raising the likelihood of isolated to scattered afternoon/evening thunderstorms in the near term.
