Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the daytime, suggesting a transition from saturated air conditions to drier, more stable air. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving into the region, which typically brings clearer skies and reduced storm potential. Wind speeds rose notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift from variable to consistently easterly and northeasterly flow, indicative of a developing onshore breeze. These combined factors point to a stable, drying trend with improving conditions, though residual moisture may still support isolated brief showers late in the period.
