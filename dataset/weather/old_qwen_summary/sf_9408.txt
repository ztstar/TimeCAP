Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the air, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, aligning with typical coastal patterns influenced by marine layer dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition from a cool, foggy, and damp period toward clearer skies and slightly warmer conditions as the high-pressure system strengthens.
