Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point before gradually rising during the early morning hours, indicating a nocturnal cooling phase followed by daytime warming. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and a damp feel. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night, peaking in the early morning, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the south, hinting at a change in air mass. These patterns collectively suggest the dissipation of overnight cloud cover and improving conditions, with a transition toward drier and more stable weather in the coming hours.
