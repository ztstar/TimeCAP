Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking during the early hours before gradually decreasing, indicating a moist, stable air mass. Air pressure showed a significant spike midday, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and improved conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southeast to the east-southeast, signaling changing circulation patterns. These combined factors point to a transition toward more stable and drier conditions, though residual moisture and wind could support localized showers or thunderstorms later into the night.
