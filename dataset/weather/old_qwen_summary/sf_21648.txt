Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the late afternoon, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, remaining near saturation, which supports the presence of fog and low clouds typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night and early morning, shifting to lighter winds in the midday hours before strengthening again in the late afternoon, with wind direction trending from southwest to west-southwest, consistent with onshore flow. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal marine influence, with persistent fog and cool temperatures, likely contributing to a damp, overcast environment across the city.
