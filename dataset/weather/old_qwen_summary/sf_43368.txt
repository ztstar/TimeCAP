Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which strongly suggests the presence of fog or low cloud cover, consistent with coastal fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of significant frontal activity and stable atmospheric conditions. Wind patterns showed a shift from southerly to westerly and then to more northerly directions, with increased speeds in the late afternoon and evening, likely contributing to the dispersion of fog and a slight warming trend. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and shifting wind direction points to a transition from a foggy, cool morning to a clearer, slightly warmer afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
