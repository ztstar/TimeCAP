Temperature trends indicate a cooling period during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the early morning hours, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity remained elevated through the night, dropping significantly in the morning before stabilizing, which may indicate clearing skies and reduced fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, peaking in the late afternoon, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated throughout the day, with stronger gusts in the evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition from cooler, moist conditions to a more stable, drier, and gradually warming environment, typical of a clearing day in San Francisco’s coastal climate.
