Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a sustained period of near-saturation humidity, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which increases the likelihood of fog or low clouds. Temperatures remained consistently low, with a gradual decline through the early morning hours followed by a slight recovery in the late afternoon, suggesting a stable, cool air mass influence. Air pressure showed a steady upward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early morning and midday, with stronger gusts from the northwest to west sectors, potentially indicating a shift in atmospheric circulation or the influence of a developing frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, rising pressure, and fluctuating wind patterns hints at a transition phase, possibly leading to improved visibility and drier conditions later, though lingering moisture may still support isolated showers.
