Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, suggesting a period of increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase during the early hours, indicating stable atmospheric conditions without significant storm development. Wind patterns exhibited a shift from moderate southerly flow during the night to a brief calm, followed by strengthening from the southeast in the late afternoon, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind direction suggests the possibility of clearing skies and improving conditions later in the day.
