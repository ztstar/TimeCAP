Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining during the night and early morning before beginning to stabilize and slightly rise in the late afternoon. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the early morning hours, indicating a possible increase in moisture content, likely due to overnight condensation or low-level convergence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained generally low, with only brief increases during the night and early morning, while wind direction shifted from northwest to more southerly and easterly, signaling a change in air mass flow. These patterns collectively point to a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, with potential for improving visibility and clearer skies in the coming hours.
