Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight and remained low during the early morning, with winds shifting from a northerly to a southeasterly direction, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing winds, and a clearing trend in the late afternoon suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition to drier and more stable air by the next day.
