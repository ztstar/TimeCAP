Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early hours, remained elevated through the night, and gradually decreased in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a saturated to a drier air mass. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning hours, followed by a rebound in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent stabilization. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, consistent with a change in atmospheric circulation. These patterns point to the influence of a passing frontal system, which brought cooler, moister air and increased wind activity, potentially leading to unsettled conditions with a chance of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
