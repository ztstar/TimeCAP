Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rising again. Humidity levels surged to near saturation in the early hours, remaining high through mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting a shift in air mass or clearing conditions. A notable drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, followed by a rebound, indicating the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and east, likely driven by a developing sea breeze or frontal interaction. The combination of declining pressure, high humidity, and strong winds points to dynamic atmospheric changes, potentially signaling the approach of a storm system or shifting coastal weather patterns.
