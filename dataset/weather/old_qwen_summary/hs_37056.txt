Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by clear skies and increasing solar heating. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation during low-temperature periods. A notable drop in humidity occurred in the afternoon, coinciding with rising temperatures and increased wind speeds, signaling the arrival of drier air likely brought by a shifting wind pattern. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from directions indicating a southerly to westerly flow, which may have transported warmer, drier air from inland regions. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the early morning, followed by a slight decline in the evening, consistent with the passage of a weakening high-pressure system and possible approaching instability that could lead to afternoon thunderstorms.
