Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn, which is characteristic of fog formation typical in the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns with a low-pressure dip in the early hours, suggesting possible instability and the influence of shifting weather systems approaching from the Pacific. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late evening and overnight, with sustained higher velocities and a shift in wind direction toward the northwest and west, consistent with onshore flow that can bring fog and cool air. These combined conditions point to a coastal weather pattern dominated by marine influence, with potential for foggy mornings and mild temperatures, affecting visibility and outdoor activities.
