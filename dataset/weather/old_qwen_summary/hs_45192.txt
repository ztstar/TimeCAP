Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming trend into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nocturnal conditions to a more typical daytime heat buildup. Humidity levels showed marked fluctuations, with periods of high moisture in the early morning and late night, likely contributing to dew formation and reduced comfort, while lower values in the afternoon suggest drier air due to increased mixing. A gradual decrease in air pressure during the middle of the period, culminating in a sharp rise late in the cycle, suggests the passage of a weather front, possibly indicating a high-pressure system building in and stabilizing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast to south-southwest, which may have facilitated the influx of warmer, moister air and potential convective development. Together, these indicators point to a dynamic transition in Houston’s weather, with conditions shifting from cool and humid to warmer and drier, potentially setting the stage for unstable air later in the day.
