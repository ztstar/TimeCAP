Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature rise, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a strong warming trend likely driven by solar radiation and atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels showed a marked decline in the afternoon, dropping to near-dry conditions, which may have contributed to increased heat absorption and a heightened heat index. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly directions, with elevated speeds in the mid-to-late afternoon, potentially enhancing convective instability and increasing the risk of localized thunderstorms. The combination of rising temperatures, low humidity, and increasing wind speeds under a strengthening high-pressure dome poses a moderate risk of heat stress and could set the stage for afternoon thunderstorms as the day progresses.
