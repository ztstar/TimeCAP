Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. A notable increase in air pressure occurred in the late morning and early afternoon, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that generally brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift to more southerly and easterly directions, suggesting the arrival of a coastal breeze or a change in synoptic flow. These combined patterns point to a transition from a cool, moist, foggy coastal regime to a warmer, drier, and windier afternoon, typical of San Francisco’s diurnal weather cycle.
