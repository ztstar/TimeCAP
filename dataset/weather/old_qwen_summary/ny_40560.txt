Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend toward the late evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, which may suggest the passage of a moisture-laden air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend overnight, culminating in a higher pressure system that often correlates with improving weather and clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the early and late hours, with gusts from the southwest and west, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions possibly tied to a frontal passage. The shift in wind direction toward more westerly and northerly sectors late in the period points to the influence of a developing high-pressure system, which could bring drier, cooler air and stable conditions in the coming hours.
