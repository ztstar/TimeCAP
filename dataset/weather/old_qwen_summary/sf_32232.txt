Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the overnight hours, with temperatures reaching their lowest point in the early morning before gradually rising. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night, peaking above 90% and remaining elevated into the early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover consistent with the region’s marine layer. Air pressure showed a slight overall increase during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual decline through the afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system and potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds intensified during the late evening and early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, reinforcing the marine influence and contributing to the cooling and foggy conditions. The shift in wind direction from northerly to westerly and later to southerly suggests a dynamic shift in atmospheric flow, which may signal the approach of a change in weather, potentially clearing skies and warming temperatures in the coming hours.
