Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early hours, dropping sharply in the midday before rebounding slightly in the evening, indicating possible fog or low cloud dissipation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weak low-pressure system. Wind speeds were variable, with peak gusts in the early morning and late evening, primarily from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast in the late evening may signal a change in airflow, potentially bringing in warmer, drier air and influencing the overnight conditions.
