Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature decline during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels dropped sharply during the early morning, reaching a minimum before rising again in the late morning and afternoon, suggesting potential moisture advection or localized convection. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night, peaking just before dawn, followed by a sharp drop mid-morning—likely signaling the passage of a front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, possibly indicating a change in synoptic-scale flow. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day, especially as surface heating resumes.
