Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the day. Humidity levels were elevated during the night and early morning, suggesting possible fog formation, which then declined significantly during the afternoon as conditions became drier. A sharp drop in air pressure occurred around midnight, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather patterns. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning and midday, with strong, consistent winds from the southwest to west sectors, which may have contributed to the cooling and moisture dispersion. The combination of falling pressure, shifting wind direction, and decreasing humidity suggests that a marine layer dissipated, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable conditions later in the day.
