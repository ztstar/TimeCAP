Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before stabilizing and beginning to rise slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decline toward the end of the period, indicating potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were strongest during the early to mid-night hours, coming from the northwest, which likely helped transport maritime air and maintain cool, moist conditions. As winds weakened and shifted toward the west-southwest in the afternoon, conditions began to stabilize, suggesting a possible clearing trend later in the day.
