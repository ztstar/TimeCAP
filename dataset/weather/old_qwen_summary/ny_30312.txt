Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily dropped during the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cooling and daytime heating. Humidity levels exhibited a notable decline through the morning and midday, suggesting drying air mass movement, which may have contributed to clearer skies and improved visibility. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the late afternoon and evening, signaling the arrival of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds intensified significantly during the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west, indicating stronger upper-level winds associated with a developing or passing weather front. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition toward drier, cooler, and more stable conditions, likely leading to clear skies and pleasant weather in the coming hours.
