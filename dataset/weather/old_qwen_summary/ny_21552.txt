Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have shown a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising during the late morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting a buildup of moisture that could contribute to fog or light precipitation. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent during the night and early morning, then diminished in the late afternoon, with winds shifting from a northwest to a more west-northwest direction. These trends collectively point to a transitioning weather pattern, with improving conditions and potential for clear skies later in the day.
