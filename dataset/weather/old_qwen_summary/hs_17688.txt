Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining steadily, indicating a shift from saturated air to drier conditions, likely due to increasing air mass stability. Air pressure showed a slight decline through the night and into the early morning, followed by a more pronounced drop in the late afternoon, which is often associated with approaching low-pressure systems and potential storm development. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the day, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, enhancing moisture transport and instability. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic weather pattern conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, with a higher likelihood of convective activity later in the day.
