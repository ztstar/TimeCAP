Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently high overnight, dropping sharply during midday before spiking again in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of marine air inflow and possible fog formation. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, peaking before declining slightly, which may reflect the passage of a high-pressure ridge or a shift in synoptic-scale flow. Wind conditions were generally light and variable, with brief periods of stronger winds and shifts in direction, particularly in the evening, pointing to localized coastal breezes or gusty episodes. These patterns collectively suggest a stable marine layer with intermittent ventilation, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, potentially leading to foggy mornings and clearing skies in the afternoon.
