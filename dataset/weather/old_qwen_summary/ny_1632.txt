Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising significantly in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating saturated air conditions that likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure remained consistently stable, suggesting the absence of a strong weather system passing through, which aligns with the lack of significant precipitation. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and westerly flows during the early hours to near-calm conditions by mid-morning, followed by a resurgence of moderate winds from the southwest in the late afternoon. These conditions suggest a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for changing weather later in the day.
