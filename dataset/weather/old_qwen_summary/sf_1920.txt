Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the late night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before declining as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, indicating a weakening high-pressure system and the potential approach of a low-pressure front. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained strong winds from the south and southwest, likely driven by coastal dynamics and pressure gradients. These conditions suggest the onset of a more dynamic weather pattern, potentially bringing increased cloud cover, fog, or even precipitation in the coming hours.
