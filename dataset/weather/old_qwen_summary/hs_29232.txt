Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching near saturation during the night and early morning before dropping sharply during the midday, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the evening and early night, peaking just before dawn, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind patterns shifted from southerly and easterly flows in the early hours to more westerly and northerly directions by midday, aligning with the movement of the high-pressure system and potentially bringing cooler air into the region. The combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and changing wind direction points to a drying trend and improved air quality, which may signal the end of a period of potential thunderstorm development and a shift toward more stable, pleasant conditions.
