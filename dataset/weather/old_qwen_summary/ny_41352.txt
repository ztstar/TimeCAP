Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a transition from a cooler nighttime phase to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the overnight period, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a notable fluctuation, with a sharp increase midday followed by a steady decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front that may bring changing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwest to southwest, hinting at the influence of a developing low-pressure system. These combined patterns suggest that New York City experienced a dynamic weather shift, with potential for precipitation and unsettled conditions in the near term.
