Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady recovery into the afternoon, indicating a significant diurnal cycle likely influenced by overnight cloud cover and cooling. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation during the early morning, which suggests the presence of a moist air mass and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night and early morning, followed by a steady drop into the afternoon, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that could bring instability. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly and then westerly, indicating changing flow patterns consistent with a developing weather front. Together, these trends suggest that Houston is transitioning into a period of potentially unsettled weather, with increased chances of showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
