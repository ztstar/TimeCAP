Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping sharply during the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the early hours, peaking near dawn, followed by a dramatic decline, particularly in the mid-morning, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable rise during the early morning hours, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief intensification in the early hours, while wind direction shifted from northerly to southeasterly, reflecting changing airflow patterns associated with the high-pressure buildup. These conditions point to a stable, dry, and cool atmosphere, conducive to clear skies and comfortable daytime temperatures, typical of a coastal high-pressure event.
