Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating the influence of a significant weather shift. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with extended periods of high moisture content followed by brief drops, suggesting intermittent convective activity or frontal passage. A steady decline in air pressure, culminating in a low-pressure trough, points to an approaching storm system or active frontal boundary. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with gusts reaching peak levels during periods of instability, often coinciding with changes in wind direction from south to southwest and later to west-northwest, consistent with storm movement. These combined indicators suggest the arrival of a dynamic and potentially disruptive weather event, increasing the likelihood of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the near term.
