Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal system. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating the presence of moist air that may have contributed to increased cloud cover. Air pressure showed a slight drop toward the end of the period, consistent with an approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the south-southwest, with light to moderate speeds, suggesting changing circulation as the system evolved. These combined indicators point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with potential for showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
