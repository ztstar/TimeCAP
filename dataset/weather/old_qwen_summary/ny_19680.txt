Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline followed by a gradual回升, indicating a cold night transitioning into a warming morning. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the mid-morning before dropping sharply, suggesting a possible clearing trend. Air pressure initially remained stable, then experienced a notable drop, followed by a strong rise, which is indicative of a passing weather system—likely a low-pressure front followed by a high-pressure build-up. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, accompanied by a shift in direction from northerly to southwest, consistent with a change in atmospheric flow. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and falling humidity suggests improving conditions, with a likely transition to clearer and drier weather in the near term.
