Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking and remaining elevated before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a shift in air mass or the influence of a passing front. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, stabilizing before a slight decline in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained light overall, with calm conditions dominating overnight and brief gusts in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing circulation patterns. These observations collectively point to a transition period, with potential for increasing cloud cover and instability by early next day, raising the possibility of scattered thunderstorms.
