Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable, moist conditions to drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to more southerly and easterly sectors, signaling changing atmospheric flow patterns. These dynamics point to a transition from marine-influenced, fog-prone conditions to a drier, more stable regime, consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure ridge.
