Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, with a slight drop in the late afternoon, suggesting possible weakening of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently low during the night and early morning, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, hinting at changing airflow patterns. These trends suggest the potential for clearing skies and improved comfort later in the day, though residual moisture may lead to localized fog or haze in the early hours if temperatures remain low.
