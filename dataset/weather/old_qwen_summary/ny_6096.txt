Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low before gradually rising through the morning and early afternoon. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, indicating a period of moisture accumulation, followed by a significant drop as the day progressed, suggesting clearing skies. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase in the middle of the night, followed by sustained high pressure, which typically signals stable, dry conditions and calm weather. Wind speeds remained generally low except for a brief but notable surge late in the evening, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest dynamic atmospheric changes. The combination of high pressure, falling humidity, and stable wind patterns indicates improving weather conditions, likely leading to clearer skies and a more comfortable environment in the coming hours.
