Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖, indicating a cooling trend overnight and a return to milder conditions by midday. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to foggy or overcast conditions, particularly during the night. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred around the same period, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought unstable weather. Wind speeds increased dramatically in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, hinting at a change in air mass and possible storm development. These combined factors point to a dynamic weather transition, with a potential for precipitation and cooler temperatures in the near term.
