Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a stable diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, suggesting fog formation or marine layer development, which later decreased as temperatures rose and the layer dissipated. Air pressure initially rose steadily through the night, then dropped sharply around midday before rebounding, signaling the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly during the evening and overnight, with strong southerly to westerly flows, likely contributing to the transport of marine air and enhancing coastal fog. The shift in wind direction toward the east and northeast in the late afternoon and evening may indicate a change in synoptic conditions, potentially setting the stage for a transition in the local weather pattern.
