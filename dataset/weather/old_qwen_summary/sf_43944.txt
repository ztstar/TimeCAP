Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a dramatic increase during the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, indicating the onset of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting an approaching weather system, possibly a low-pressure front, which may bring more unsettled conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with a shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing pressure gradients and the influence of local topography. Combined, these trends point to a transition period marked by coastal fog, cooling temperatures, and the potential for precipitation or continued overcast skies later in the day.
