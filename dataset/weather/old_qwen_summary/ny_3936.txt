Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, peaking around the time of the lowest temperatures, suggesting possible precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure rose sharply in the early morning, reaching a peak that correlates with the arrival of a high-pressure system, bringing clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest to west-southwest directions, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of these factors points to a transition from cold, damp conditions to a drier, more stable atmosphere, which may lead to improving weather in the coming hours.
