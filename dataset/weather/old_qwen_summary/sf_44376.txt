Over the past 24 hours, a pronounced cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased substantially overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. A steady decline in air pressure, particularly in the late evening and early morning, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring additional cloud cover or precipitation. Wind patterns exhibited a shift from offshore to onshore flow, with calm conditions during the night and a resurgence of wind activity in the late afternoon, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition in weather conditions, potentially increasing the likelihood of overcast skies and light drizzle in the coming hours.
