Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed during the night, followed by a steady warming through the afternoon and early evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late afternoon, particularly during the evening hours, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout most of the day, with a brief intensification in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, hinting at a change in air mass. Together, these trends suggest that New York City experienced a transition from a humid, cool night to a drier, warming day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, likely leading to improved weather conditions in the near term.
