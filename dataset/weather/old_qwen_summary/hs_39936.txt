Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing through the night. Humidity levels showed a marked decline after midday, indicating a drying trend that may reduce the chance of precipitation. Air pressure remained consistently high, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and the presence of a strong high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased significantly during the early evening, with stronger gusts from the northwest, though they moderated overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east. These conditions point to a dry, stable, and relatively calm weather pattern, with little potential for storms or significant weather changes in the immediate future.
