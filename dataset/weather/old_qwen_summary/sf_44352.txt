Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery during the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, suggesting increased moisture availability likely due to coastal fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the night, with a notable drop in the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a possible shift in atmospheric conditions, potentially linked to an approaching weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southeast and east sectors, which may be associated with a strengthening onshore flow or a developing low-pressure influence. The combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and increasing wind speeds points to a likely period of coastal fog development and potentially cooler, more unstable conditions in the coming hours.
