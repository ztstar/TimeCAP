Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with prolonged periods of near-saturated air, particularly in the overnight and early morning hours, indicating potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the late morning and early afternoon, peaking sharply before gradually declining, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system or changes in storm activity. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels and shifting from predominantly easterly to more variable directions, suggesting dynamic atmospheric changes. These patterns collectively suggest a transition in weather conditions, with potential for unstable air and increased chances of thunderstorms as the system evolves.
