Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking in the early morning hours and dropping during the afternoon, which suggests the formation and subsequent dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a high before declining sharply in the late afternoon, signaling the arrival and passage of a weather system. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, with stronger westerly to southwesterly winds, likely contributing to the mixing of air and the breakdown of the marine layer. The shift in wind direction toward the southeast and then east in the late afternoon indicates the influence of changing synoptic conditions, possibly heralding a shift in the local weather pattern.
