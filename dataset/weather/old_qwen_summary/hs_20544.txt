Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend followed by a slight rebound in temperature, indicating a shift in air mass influence. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the late hours, which suggests a saturated boundary layer conducive to fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, fair weather. Wind speeds rose significantly after midnight, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to variable directions, hinting at changing synoptic-scale dynamics. These combined factors point to a transition period where lingering moist conditions may give way to clearer skies and more stable air, though residual humidity could support early-morning fog.
