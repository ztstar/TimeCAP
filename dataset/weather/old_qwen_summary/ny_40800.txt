Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night and early morning before stabilizing, indicating a prolonged cooling trend likely driven by clear skies and radiative heat loss. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which suggests the potential for fog formation or dew accumulation. A gradual decrease in air pressure during the night and early morning, followed by a rise later in the day, points to the passage of a low-pressure system, now giving way to improving conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and again in the late afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating a change in air mass, possibly bringing in cooler, more maritime air. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable winds in the early hours implies a heightened risk of precipitation or drizzle, though subsequent pressure recovery and wind shifts suggest improving conditions ahead.
