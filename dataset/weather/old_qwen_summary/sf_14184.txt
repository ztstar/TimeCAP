Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before gradually rising again in the late morning and afternoon. A notable shift in humidity occurred mid-night, with a sharp increase followed by near-saturation levels, suggesting the development of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong frontal systems, though slight drops coincided with periods of increased wind and cloudiness. Wind patterns showed variability, with a transition from light, variable winds during the night to stronger, more consistent flows in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south, possibly driven by coastal dynamics. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and wind shifts points to a classic marine layer influence, consistent with typical San Francisco weather patterns, and may lead to persistent fog and cool conditions into the coming hours.
