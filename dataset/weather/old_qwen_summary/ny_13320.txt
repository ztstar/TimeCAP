Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, suggesting a cold front passage overnight. Humidity levels remained low during the night and early morning, then began to rise significantly in the afternoon, indicating increasing moisture availability. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the night and into the morning, peaking in the midday hours before slightly declining, which is typical of a high-pressure system dominating the region. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning and late evening, with calmer conditions during midday, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a stable, dry, and relatively cold air mass, likely bringing clear skies and cooler conditions in the immediate forecast.
