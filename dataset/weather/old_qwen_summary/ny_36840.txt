Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline, indicating a significant cooling trend, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours. Humidity levels exhibited a marked increase during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp drop during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist to a drier air mass. Air pressure steadily decreased through the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system and the approach of a high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening and overnight, with peak gusts originating from the northwest and west, consistent with a strong frontal passage. The shift in wind direction from southwest to northwest and the sustained high winds imply a change in atmospheric circulation, likely bringing colder, drier air and potentially clearing skies by morning.
