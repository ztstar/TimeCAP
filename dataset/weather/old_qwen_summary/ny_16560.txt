Temperature trends show a gradual cooling overnight followed by a steady rise in the morning, indicating a diurnal pattern typical of urban environments. Humidity levels remained stable during the early hours before increasing significantly in the late night and early morning, suggesting moisture accumulation likely due to reduced mixing and potential fog formation. Air pressure held steady through the night and then increased progressively, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were moderate during the night, with a notable increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, possibly indicating a change in air mass. Overall, the data suggest a transition toward more stable and potentially fair weather, though lingering moisture may lead to fog or low clouds in the early morning hours.
