Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual temperature recovery, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with the lowest temperatures occurring just before dawn. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or mist formation. A gradual decline in air pressure was observed, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, signaling possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially indicating the influence of a developing low-pressure system or a shift in regional airflow. These combined factors point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with conditions becoming more conducive to the development of thunderstorms later in the day.
