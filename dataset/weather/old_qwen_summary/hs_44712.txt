Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining steadily through the night and into the early morning hours, indicating a significant drop in thermal energy. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, peaking at very high levels, suggesting the presence of moist air that may have contributed to a humid, possibly oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly during the early morning, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with gusts from the northwest and west sectors, indicating potential changes in airflow dynamics that could signal shifting weather patterns. Given the combination of rising humidity, declining temperatures, and increasing pressure, conditions are now stabilizing, likely leading to clear skies and cooler mornings, though the high moisture content may result in morning fog or dew.
