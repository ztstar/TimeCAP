Temperatures remained consistently low overnight, with a gradual warming trend observed in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels spiked significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the damp feel. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light, with intermittent gusts, and wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to more easterly, consistent with a change in air mass. The combination of rising temperatures, persistent humidity, and falling pressure suggests a potential for precipitation later in the day, particularly if the system continues to develop.
