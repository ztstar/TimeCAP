Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler to a milder phase. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning hours before declining, suggesting increasing moisture content in the atmosphere during the overnight period. A dramatic spike in air pressure in the early morning, reaching a peak before rapidly falling, points to the passage of a strong low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening and overnight, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, consistent with the influence of a frontal system moving through the region. The combination of rising humidity, fluctuating pressure, and changing wind patterns strongly indicates a weather front passed through New York City, potentially bringing precipitation and unstable conditions in the near term.
