Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from nocturnal to daytime thermal conditions. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and early morning, peaking just before dawn, which suggests saturated air and potential for fog or drizzle, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure showed a slight upward trend during the midday and early evening, signaling the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low overall, with minimal variability, except for a brief increase in the late evening, likely associated with minor atmospheric adjustments. Wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to northerly and then back to easterly, indicating a complex flow pattern possibly linked to a weakening frontal boundary or local circulations.
