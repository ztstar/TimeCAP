Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures gradually declining through the night before stabilizing in the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning, indicating increasing moisture in the air, which likely contributed to fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently strong, particularly during the night and early morning, with sustained southerly to westerly winds that helped transport moist maritime air inland. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and strong winds suggests a prolonged period of fog and overcast skies, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, especially in coastal areas.
