Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying cloud cover. A notable decline in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a weather system, possibly a low-pressure front. Wind speeds increased in the early morning and again in the late evening, with variable wind directions indicating shifting air flow, potentially signaling atmospheric instability. These combined patterns suggest a transition phase in the weather, with possible precipitation or changing conditions expected in the near term.
