A notable drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely influenced by clear skies and high humidity. Humidity levels remained near saturation for extended periods, particularly during the night and early morning, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a significant spike during the early hours, which then stabilized, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system that may have brought brief clearing and calm conditions. Wind speeds were minimal overnight but increased in the late morning and afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns, possibly linked to a developing low-pressure influence. The combination of high humidity, fluctuating pressure, and variable wind direction suggests a transition phase in Houston’s weather, potentially setting the stage for unstable conditions and the possibility of thunderstorms later in the day.
