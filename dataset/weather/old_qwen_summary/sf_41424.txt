Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually rising again in the afternoon. Humidity remained consistently high during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation levels before dropping significantly in the late morning, suggesting a possible clearing of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable spike in the mid-afternoon, followed by a sharp drop later in the evening, indicating the passage of a weather front or storm system. Wind speeds increased substantially during the late afternoon and evening, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with typical coastal wind patterns influenced by pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from the south to the west and northwest, combined with the pressure and temperature changes, suggests an approaching maritime influence or frontal system that may bring cooler, windier conditions in the coming hours.
