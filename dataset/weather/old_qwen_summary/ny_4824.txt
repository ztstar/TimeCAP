Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decline after midnight, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions, particularly in the afternoon hours. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward stronger, more consistent wind from the southwest and west, likely due to the strengthening pressure gradient. These combined factors point to a drying, stabilizing atmosphere under the influence of a developing high-pressure system, reducing the likelihood of precipitation and supporting improved visibility and comfortable conditions by late evening.
