Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning, peaking during the night before declining steadily into the late morning, indicating a transition from a cool, moist air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clearer skies. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to southwest, indicating changing circulation patterns associated with the approaching high-pressure ridge. These combined trends point to a transition from a cool, damp overnight period to a milder and drier afternoon, with improved conditions likely persisting into the coming hours.
