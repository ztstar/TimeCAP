Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming toward midday. Humidity levels surged overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure showed a notable drop during the night, followed by a gradual rise, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system that brought the fog and cooler conditions. Wind patterns were highly variable, with strong winds in the evening and early night from the northwest, shifting to more variable and lighter winds during the morning hours, suggesting changing synoptic influences. These conditions collectively point to a marine layer surge, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with substantial impacts on visibility, comfort, and potential for coastal fog persisting into the day.
