Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning and again in the late evening, indicating increased moisture availability, likely contributing to the formation of fog or mist during low-temperature periods. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly and then rebounding, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions. Wind speeds were weakest during the early morning, increasing in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more southerly, indicating changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and stable air mass to a milder, more variable regime, potentially setting the stage for overcast or precipitation-prone conditions later in the day.
