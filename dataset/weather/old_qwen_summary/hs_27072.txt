Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a significant nocturnal temperature drop and recovery during daylight hours. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, which likely contributed to a damp and oppressive feel. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the late evening, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a transition toward drier conditions. Winds intensified during the afternoon and early evening, coming from the southeast and shifting toward the east-southeast, potentially signaling the approach of a stabilizing high-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition from a humid, stable night to a warmer, more dynamic day, with increasing chances of clearing skies and improved air quality.
