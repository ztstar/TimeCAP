A significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels remained low initially before sharply increasing in the late night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of moist air, possibly linked to precipitation. Air pressure showed a sharp decline during the night, reaching a low point before rebounding, which is characteristic of a passing storm system. Wind speeds intensified significantly in the late evening and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west, consistent with a developing storm or frontal boundary. The combination of falling pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind suggests unsettled weather conditions, with potential for rain or storms in the near term.
