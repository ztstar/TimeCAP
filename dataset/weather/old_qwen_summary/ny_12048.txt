Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City have steadily declined, indicating a strong cold front moving through the region. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the overnight hours, suggesting drier air has replaced the earlier moisture, likely due to a shift in wind patterns. Air pressure has shown a consistent rise, peaking near the end of the period, which is typical of approaching high-pressure systems associated with stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the early morning, with stronger southerly and westerly gusts, but subsided during the late afternoon, indicating a weakening of frontal activity. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest reflects the passage of a cold front, now leaving behind cooler, drier air and setting the stage for potentially crisp, clear conditions in the coming hours.
