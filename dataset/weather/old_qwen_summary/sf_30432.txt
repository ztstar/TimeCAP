Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the overnight period, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and created a damp, cool sensation. A significant increase in air pressure occurred during the early morning, peaking in the mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and likely suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning, with a notable shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northeast in the late morning, indicating a change in airflow associated with the high-pressure influence. The return of stronger winds in the late evening, combined with a drop in pressure, hints at the potential for changing conditions, possibly signaling the approach of a new weather system.
