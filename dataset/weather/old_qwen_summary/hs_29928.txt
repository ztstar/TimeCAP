Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before beginning to stabilize. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, suggesting increased moisture content in the air, which may have contributed to a more oppressive feel. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning, hinting at the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely brought drier and more stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds picked up in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in regional airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition toward clearer skies and more settled weather, though residual moisture and fluctuating winds may still pose a risk for localized showers or thunderstorms.
