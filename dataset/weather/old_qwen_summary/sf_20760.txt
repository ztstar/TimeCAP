Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual回暖 in the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before gradually decreasing, which suggests the presence of maritime inflow and potential fog formation. Air pressure remained nearly constant throughout the period, with minor fluctuations, indicating stable atmospheric conditions with no significant weather systems passing through. Wind speed remained consistently low, implying limited atmospheric mixing, while wind direction showed frequent shifts, particularly in the morning and evening, pointing to localized circulations or sea breeze influences. These combined factors suggest a stable, cool, and moist coastal environment, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with high potential for fog development during the night and early morning hours.
