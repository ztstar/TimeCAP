Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation and remaining extremely high, indicating a strong potential for fog or mist formation, especially during the early morning. Air pressure remained largely stable with a brief increase midday, followed by a return to baseline, suggesting no significant storm systems are currently affecting the region. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the northeast, hinting at a possible change in air mass or the approach of a frontal boundary. Overall, the combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and increasing wind activity suggests a heightened likelihood of precipitation later in the day, particularly in the late evening and overnight hours.
