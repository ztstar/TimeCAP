Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a nocturnal temperature minimum to a daytime maximum. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting increased moisture availability and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling a possible approach of a low-pressure system or frontal influence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more southeasterly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These combined patterns point to a moist, unstable air mass moving into the region, increasing the likelihood of scattered thunderstorms, particularly in the evening and overnight hours.
