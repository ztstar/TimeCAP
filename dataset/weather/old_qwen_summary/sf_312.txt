Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night before showing a slight decline in the early morning hours, indicating a possible shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds diminished to near zero during the morning hours, suggesting calm conditions, but increased again in the late afternoon, accompanied by a change in wind direction from west to southwesterly. These conditions point to a transition from a stable, fog-prone maritime layer to a more variable regime, potentially signaling the arrival of a change in weather, such as clearing skies or an onshore flow.
