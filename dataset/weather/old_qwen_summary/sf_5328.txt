Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle influenced by local coastal dynamics. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, coinciding with a significant drop in temperature, suggesting the onset of fog or low cloud cover typical of the region’s maritime climate. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with sustained high pressure in the early morning hours potentially contributing to stable, fog-prone conditions, followed by a gradual decrease as the day progressed. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and early morning, with strong offshore and variable winds from the west and northwest, likely facilitating the transport of marine air and fog inland. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and east in the late afternoon may signal the beginning of a change in air mass, possibly clearing fog and bringing drier, warmer conditions later in the day.
