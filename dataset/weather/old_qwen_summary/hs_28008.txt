Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing, indicating a strong nocturnal heat loss likely driven by cloud cover and moisture. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of a moist, stable air mass that contributed to condensation and possibly fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop during the overnight hours, followed by a sharp rise in the late morning, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system and subsequent high-pressure buildup, which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds increased significantly during the night and early morning, with strong gusts accompanied by a shift from southerly to westerly and then northeasterly directions, indicating a dynamic change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest a complex weather transition—likely associated with a cold front movement—leading to cooler, more stable conditions and potential for clearing skies in the coming hours.
