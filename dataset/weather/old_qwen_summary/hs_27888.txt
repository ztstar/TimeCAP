Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or mist in the early hours, before declining as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a notable decrease in the latter half of the period, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and then southerly again, suggesting changing airflow patterns associated with the developing system. These combined trends signal a transition toward potentially stormy weather, with increased risk of precipitation and gusty winds in the near term.
