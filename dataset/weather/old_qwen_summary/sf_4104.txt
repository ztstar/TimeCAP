Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily dropping through the night before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. High humidity levels, particularly during early morning hours, suggest the presence of fog or low-level moisture, consistent with the city’s coastal climate patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations indicating a persistent, weak high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift from westerly to northerly and then easterly directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass or the onset of a sea breeze cycle. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal weather pattern, with nighttime cooling, fog development, and variable wind patterns driven by thermal gradients between land and ocean.
