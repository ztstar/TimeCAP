Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early afternoon before declining significantly overnight, indicating a transition toward more stable, cooler conditions. Humidity levels remained elevated during the day, particularly in the morning and midday hours, suggesting the presence of moist air masses, which may have contributed to increased discomfort and localized fog or mist. A notable drop in humidity occurred in the late night and early morning, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and a rapid rise in air pressure, signaling the arrival of drier air from a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the final hours, reaching peak values with strong, sustained gusts from the northwest and west sectors, implying a tightening pressure gradient and potential for gusty conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, drying air, and intensifying winds suggests the passage of a cold front, which could bring clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the near term.
