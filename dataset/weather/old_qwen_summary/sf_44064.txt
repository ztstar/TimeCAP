Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual rebound in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the northwest and west sectors, suggesting a shift in local circulation patterns. These conditions point to a clear, calm, and cool night followed by a warming, somewhat breezy day—typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability, especially near the coastal areas.
