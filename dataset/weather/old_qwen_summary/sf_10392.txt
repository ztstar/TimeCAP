Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cooling pattern influenced by coastal fog. Humidity levels increased significantly during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, which is consistent with fog formation as air cooled to its dew point. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, suggesting the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low overnight, with a notable increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from easterly to northerly, potentially signaling a change in local airflow dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind, and decreasing humidity suggests a transition from foggy, cool conditions toward clearer, drier weather in the coming hours.
