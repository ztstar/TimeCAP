Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining throughout the night and early morning before stabilizing in the late morning. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the early hours and remaining near saturation, indicating strong moisture presence in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may influence future weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted significantly from west to south and then southeast, reflecting changing atmospheric dynamics. These conditions point to the influence of a coastal fog event, likely driven by marine layer development, which is typical for San Francisco’s microclimate during transitional periods.
