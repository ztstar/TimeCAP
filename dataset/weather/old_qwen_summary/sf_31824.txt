Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual warming in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable spike in the early morning and a sharp drop during midday, indicating changing air mass dynamics. Wind speeds increased substantially during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period before tapering off, with consistent westerly to southwesterly flow suggesting the influence of coastal breeze patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise in the afternoon, pointing to the presence of a high-pressure system that may be suppressing storm development. These conditions collectively suggest a typical marine layer pattern with strong coastal winds and variable moisture, contributing to cool, foggy mornings and clearer, warmer afternoons.
