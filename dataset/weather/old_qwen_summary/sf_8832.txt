Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a distinct overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels remained consistently low, especially during the early morning and late evening hours, suggesting dry air infiltration, likely due to offshore breezes or subsidence. Air pressure exhibited a steady increase through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing, which is indicative of a high-pressure system influencing the region and contributing to stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a notable shift in direction from westerly to northeasterly in the early morning, followed by a return to more variable flow, possibly reflecting local topographic effects or changing pressure gradients. Overall, the data suggest a dry, stable, and mild weather regime, consistent with a typical San Francisco summer day under the influence of a persistent high-pressure ridge.
