Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a distinct cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed a dramatic rise during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests fog formation and reduced visibility. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the west, indicating a possible approaching weather system. The persistence of high humidity and calm conditions during the early morning hours contributed to dense fog, which likely affected transportation and outdoor activities. The recent increase in wind speed and pressure recovery may signal the onset of clearing skies, potentially improving conditions later in the day.
