Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a pronounced diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought stable, dry conditions during the day. Wind speeds were minimal overnight, increasing in the late afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from southerly to more easterly directions, potentially signaling a change in air mass. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable wind patterns suggests the possibility of localized showers or thunderstorms in the coming hours, particularly during the late afternoon and evening.
