Over the past 24 hours, a steady drop in temperature was observed, indicating a persistent cooling trend, likely due to an advancing cold front. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the late night and early morning, before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moisture-laden system followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clear weather. Wind speeds intensified during the late night and early morning, with strong gusts from the northwest and west, aligning with the movement of the high-pressure system and potential for gusty conditions. The combination of dropping temperatures, falling humidity, and strong winds points to a transition toward cooler, drier, and potentially breezy conditions in New York City.
