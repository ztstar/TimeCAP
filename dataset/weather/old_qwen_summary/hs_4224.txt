Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to increasing daytime heat. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning hours but rose sharply in the late night and early morning, peaking and stabilizing during the pre-dawn hours before declining again, suggesting the influence of moisture-laden air masses. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the early morning, reaching a peak before beginning to decline, signaling the passage of a high-pressure system and potential changes in weather stability. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, with calm conditions prevailing in the early morning, followed by a resurgence in wind activity in the late afternoon and evening, likely due to shifting pressure gradients. Wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly and northwesterly during the night to more southerly and easterly in the afternoon, hinting at a possible influx of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, which could contribute to increased humidity and potential for thunderstorms later in the day.
