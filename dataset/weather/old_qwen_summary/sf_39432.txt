Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking near 100%, which likely contributed to the formation of dense fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but showed a slight decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the potential approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light during the night, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from coastal to more onshore, which may enhance marine layer development. Combined, these indicators point to a typical coastal marine weather pattern, with a cooling nocturnal period, fog formation, and a developing onshore flow that could bring cooler, more humid conditions into the next day.
