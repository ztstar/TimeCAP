Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before declining through the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may influence future weather patterns. Wind speeds remained low and consistent until late evening, when they increased slightly, with winds shifting from northwest to west-southwest, indicative of changing flow dynamics. These conditions suggest the arrival of a maritime influence, possibly bringing overcast skies or light fog, particularly during the overnight hours, with potential for more dynamic weather as the pressure system evolves.
