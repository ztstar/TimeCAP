Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, reaching saturation and remaining at 100% for much of the early morning, indicating high potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the early hours, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased steadily through the day, with a notable rise in the late afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling patterns. These indicators collectively point to a marine layer developing and intensifying, likely resulting in foggy conditions and cool temperatures in the city, especially during the morning hours.
