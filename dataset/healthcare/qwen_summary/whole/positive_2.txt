Influenza activity has shown a sustained and accelerating increase over the past 20 weeks, with both the number of specimens tested and the proportion testing positive rising sharply, particularly in the last 10 weeks. Influenza A has been the dominant strain throughout the period, with its proportion of positive cases growing faster than Influenza B and contributing significantly to the overall rise in positivity rates. The positivity rate has more than doubled in the final five weeks, indicating a significant surge in circulation, likely signaling the peak of the current seasonal wave. The disproportionate increase in Influenza A relative to Influenza B suggests a shift in circulating strains, which may influence vaccine effectiveness and public health response strategies. These trends imply heightened risk for severe outcomes and underscore the need for intensified surveillance, clinical preparedness, and vaccination efforts.
