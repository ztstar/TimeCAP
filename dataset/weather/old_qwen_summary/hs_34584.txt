Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity remained consistently high, reaching saturation levels during the overnight hours, which contributed to a dense, muggy atmosphere conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, particularly in the final hours, indicating a possible approaching low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the period, with a notable increase in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These conditions collectively suggest the onset of a transitional weather phase, potentially leading to thunderstorm development later in the day.
