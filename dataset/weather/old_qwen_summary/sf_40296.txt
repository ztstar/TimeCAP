Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend overnight, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during midday, followed by a resurgence in the evening, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible fog formation later in the period. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before a sharp decline in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds intensified in the early hours, particularly from a westerly to northwesterly direction, likely contributing to the cooling and moisture transport. The combination of these factors points to a transitional weather pattern, potentially bringing coastal fog and cooler conditions into the evening and night.
