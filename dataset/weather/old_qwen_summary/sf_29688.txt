Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature decline during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a strong nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed notable fluctuations, with a series of drops and brief spikes, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions influenced by shifting air masses. Wind speeds increased notably during the night and early morning, with stronger gusts from the northwest and west sectors, consistent with marine air intrusion typical of the region’s coastal climate. These combined factors—cooling temperatures, high humidity, variable pressure, and fluctuating wind patterns—point to a transition period likely bringing overcast skies and potential fog, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
