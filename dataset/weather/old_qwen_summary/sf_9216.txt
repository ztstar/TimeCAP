Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking at saturation, which contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility during the pre-dawn period. Air pressure showed a strong increase during the early morning, stabilizing at a high level, indicating the presence of a robust high-pressure system that suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. Wind speeds were minimal after midnight, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly around midday, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These conditions collectively point to a clear, stable weather pattern with a morning fog event, likely driven by marine layer dynamics and subsidence under the high-pressure ridge.
