Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a cooling nocturnal phase succeeded by a daytime rebound. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking and remaining high throughout the morning and midday, suggesting the presence of fog or low-level moisture that likely contributed to reduced visibility and a cooler feel. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before slowly rising again, signaling a passing weather system and potential for clearing skies later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and midday, with gusts from the southeast and south-southeast directions, likely enhancing the oceanic influence and contributing to the cooler conditions. The shift in wind direction toward the northeast and north in the late afternoon suggests a change in air mass, possibly heralding a transition to more stable and drier conditions as the day progresses.
