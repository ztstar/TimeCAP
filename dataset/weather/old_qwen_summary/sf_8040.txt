Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening, indicating increasing solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained high in the early morning and night, dropping significantly during midday before rebounding in the late evening, suggesting a shift in moisture dynamics possibly linked to coastal fog dissipation and onshore flow. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the early morning hours, followed by stabilization and slight fluctuations, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system or shifting synoptic conditions. Wind speeds were generally light throughout most of the day, with a brief increase in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the northwest, indicative of changing airflow patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition from a foggy, stable marine layer to a drier, more variable air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and warmer conditions in the coming hours.
