Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating the passage of a cold front and subsequent stabilization. Humidity levels remained near saturation during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting fog formation and reduced visibility, which is typical for the region’s microclimate. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, signaling an approaching low-pressure system that may bring continued overcast conditions or precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, potentially enhancing onshore flow and marine layer dynamics. These combined indicators suggest a persistent marine influence with elevated fog and damp conditions likely to continue into the coming hours.
