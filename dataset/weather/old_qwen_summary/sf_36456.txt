Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during midday, suggesting the clearing of fog or low clouds. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early morning, followed by a steady rise, which may reflect the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased during the early morning and late afternoon, with shifting wind directions implying dynamic atmospheric circulation, possibly associated with coastal upwelling or frontal activity. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a cooler, moist maritime air mass to a drier, more stable regime, potentially signaling improving conditions later in the day.
