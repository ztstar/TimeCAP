Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day, indicating the onset of a daytime heating pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking during the early morning hours and remaining elevated throughout the day, which enhances the perception of mugginess and supports potential for convective activity. Air pressure showed a slight decline, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system or a shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the late afternoon and evening, while wind direction shifted progressively from southerly to easterly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass flow that could influence storm development. Combined, these trends suggest an environment conducive to afternoon thunderstorms, especially as the day warms and moisture remains abundant.
