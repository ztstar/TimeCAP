Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a developing diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase during the day, signaling generally fair and stable conditions without significant storm development. Wind patterns shifted notably from west-northwesterly to northeasterly and then to southeasterly directions, with sustained speeds in the moderate range, potentially transporting moist air from the Atlantic. These combined conditions suggest a transition from a cool, damp night into a milder, potentially clearer day, with limited precipitation risk but possible lingering fog in low-lying areas.
