A notable surge occurred mid-period, followed by a brief consolidation phase before resuming an upward trend, suggesting renewed investor confidence and underlying market strength. The recent acceleration in the final days, with consecutive record highs, signals potential momentum-driven pricing and heightened risk appetite, warranting caution around possible short-term overextension.
