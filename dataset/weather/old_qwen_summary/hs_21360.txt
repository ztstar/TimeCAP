Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, indicating a transition from nocturnal cooling to daytime heating. Humidity remained consistently high through the night and early morning, then sharply dropped in the afternoon, suggesting a weakening of moisture-laden air masses. Air pressure showed a sustained upward trend, particularly during the afternoon, which is typically indicative of improving weather conditions and the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more easterly, hinting at changing atmospheric circulation patterns. These combined factors suggest the approach of a drier, more stable air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation in the near term.
