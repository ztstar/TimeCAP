Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as daylight returned. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, indicating periods of enhanced moisture, likely due to fog formation or marine layer activity. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief bursts during transitional periods, while wind direction shifted sporadically, hinting at localized circulation changes near coastal areas. These patterns collectively suggest the presence of a persistent marine layer that has begun to break down, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
