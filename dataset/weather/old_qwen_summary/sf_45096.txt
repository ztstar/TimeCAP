Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a steady maritime influence, likely contributing to the stable thermal profile. The extremely low humidity levels indicate dry air, which may enhance daytime heating and contribute to a pronounced diurnal temperature variation once sunlight intensifies. The unchanging air pressure implies the absence of approaching weather systems, maintaining current conditions with minimal chance of precipitation or storm development. Overall, the weather remains calm and predictable, consistent with a typical coastal high-pressure regime.
