Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early hours, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, indicating a persistent high-pressure influence that has helped maintain the foggy and cool conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow that may signal the onset of a transition in weather patterns. The combination of high humidity and cooling temperatures has created a persistent marine layer, typical of San Francisco's microclimate, with potential for continued foggy conditions into the early morning hours.
