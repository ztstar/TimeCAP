Temperature showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before gradually rising through the day. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the night and into the early morning, suggesting a saturated atmosphere that could support fog or dew formation. Air pressure increased steadily through the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, with stronger southerly and easterly flows, likely transporting moist air into the region. Combined with rising temperatures and persistent high humidity, this pattern suggests a transition toward potentially humid and unstable conditions later in the day.
