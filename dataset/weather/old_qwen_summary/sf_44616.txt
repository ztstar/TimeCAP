Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The persistent lack of variation suggests a well-established high-pressure system dominating the region, leading to calm and dry weather. The consistently low humidity levels indicate arid conditions, which may contribute to increased fire risk, particularly in nearby vegetation. The steady northeasterly wind flow, while gentle, maintains a consistent pattern that could influence coastal fog dispersion and localized microclimates. Overall, the stability in all key indicators points to a prolonged period of clear skies and mild conditions, with minimal potential for sudden weather changes.
