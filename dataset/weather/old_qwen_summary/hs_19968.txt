Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a nocturnal temperature drop and a rising daytime temperature. Humidity remained near saturation throughout, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which increases the likelihood of precipitation or fog. Air pressure steadily increased, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds rose significantly during the late evening and overnight hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwesterly to northeasterly, indicating changing circulation patterns possibly linked to a developing weather front. These combined factors suggest a transition toward a more stable and potentially dry weather regime, with reduced chances of thunderstorms but continued humidity and potential for early morning fog.
