Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, especially during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which is typical for the region during this time of year. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early hours, driven by strong onshore flow from the northwest, contributing to the cooling and fog formation. As the day progressed, winds diminished and shifted toward more southerly and easterly directions, coinciding with a rise in temperature and a drop in humidity. These patterns suggest a typical marine layer event, with nighttime cooling and fog giving way to clearer skies and milder conditions during the afternoon.
