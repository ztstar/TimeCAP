Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the early afternoon. Humidity remained high throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, which contributed to a muggy feel, especially during the overnight hours. Air pressure showed a fluctuating but generally stable pattern, with a slight increase in the early morning followed by a gradual decrease, suggesting possible changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were moderate, with a brief spike in the early morning, and wind direction shifted from northeast to east-southeast, consistent with a prevailing onshore flow that may have brought in marine air. These conditions point to a stable, moist environment with potential for early morning fog and limited convective activity, though the weakening winds and falling pressure toward the end of the period could signal a shift in weather patterns.
