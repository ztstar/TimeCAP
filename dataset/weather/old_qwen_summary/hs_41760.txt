Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking at saturation before sharply declining in the late morning, indicating the dissipation of moisture possibly due to warming and mixing. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced precipitation risk. Wind speeds remained low during the early hours but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from southerly to westerly and later to more northerly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. These conditions point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal period to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, consistent with a developing high-pressure ridge influencing the region.
