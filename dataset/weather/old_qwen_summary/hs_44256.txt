Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a noticeable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night before rebounding in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged significantly during the early morning hours, peaking near saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. A gradual decline in air pressure, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggests the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and shifting directions pointing to dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined factors—rising humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind—signal the potential for thunderstorms or heavy rainfall in the near term.
