Temperature declined steadily through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning before beginning a gradual rise, indicating a cold night followed by a warming trend. Humidity increased through the early hours, peaking in the middle of the night before dropping sharply in the morning, suggesting a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure steadily rose after midnight, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified through the night, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest, indicating changing atmospheric dynamics. Combined, these trends suggest a transition from a cool, humid, and breezy night toward a clearer, drier, and gradually warming day under the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system.
