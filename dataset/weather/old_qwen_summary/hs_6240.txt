Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced nighttime cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming through the morning and afternoon, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly during the evening and early night, peaking around midnight before declining, suggesting the presence of a stable boundary layer and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, then stabilized, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clear skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds decreased markedly during the night, especially around dawn, with a shift in wind direction toward the southwest, implying a change in airflow patterns consistent with surface-based stabilization. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a humid, calm, and stable nocturnal environment to a drier, windier, and more dynamic daytime regime, which may elevate the risk of heat accumulation and air quality concerns later in the day.
