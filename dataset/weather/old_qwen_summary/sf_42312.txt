Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the overnight and early morning hours, with near-saturation conditions suggesting increased fog potential. A notable drop in wind speed during the early morning hours, accompanied by calm conditions, likely contributed to the formation of dense fog and reduced visibility. The wind direction shifted significantly through the night, transitioning from westerly to southerly and then to easterly, reflecting the influence of local topography and sea breeze dynamics. Air pressure showed slight fluctuations, with a brief rise followed by a decline, which, combined with the wind and humidity patterns, points to a transient weather system passing through the region.
