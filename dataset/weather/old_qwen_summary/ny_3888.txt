Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a shift in air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly in the overnight and early morning periods, indicating saturated air conditions that may have contributed to fog or reduced visibility. Air pressure showed significant variability, with a sharp decline in the late night and early morning, followed by a rebound, signaling the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased dramatically during the same period, peaking in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, consistent with a cold front moving through. These combined factors point to a dynamic and potentially unsettled weather pattern, likely resulting in precipitation and cooler conditions in the near term.
