Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely associated with a passing frontal boundary. Air pressure exhibited a notable fluctuation, with a sharp drop during the night and early morning, followed by a recovery, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable in the early morning to stronger southerly and easterly flows later in the day, consistent with the influence of a developing synoptic-scale circulation. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period marked by instability, increasing the potential for thunderstorms or scattered showers in the coming hours.
