Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend followed by a gradual warming during the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking around dawn before dropping steadily, suggesting the influence of overnight condensation and subsequent drying as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly during the late evening and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or shifting weather front. Wind speeds were minimal during the overnight hours, increasing significantly in the afternoon and evening, with winds shifting from variable directions to a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, potentially bringing in moist air. These combined patterns suggest a transition period where a cooling nocturnal boundary layer gave way to daytime heating, possibly setting the stage for afternoon convective activity if moisture and instability persist.
