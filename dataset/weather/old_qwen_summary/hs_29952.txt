Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning, remaining near saturation before sharply declining through the day, suggesting a transition from high moisture conditions to drier air. Air pressure fluctuated throughout the period, with a notable drop in the early morning followed by a rebound, hinting at shifting atmospheric dynamics potentially linked to a passing weather front. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and northerly, which may indicate the influence of a changing pressure gradient. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a frontal system, bringing a transition from humid, stable conditions to drier, more variable air that could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential later in the day.
