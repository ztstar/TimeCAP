Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in air pressure occurred around midday, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system, likely associated with changing weather conditions. Temperature trends show a notable cooling in the early morning followed by a gradual rise, indicating a transition from a cold, stable period to a warmer, more unstable phase. Humidity levels increased sharply during the night and remained elevated, suggesting moist air has moved into the region, which may contribute to fog or precipitation. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout, with a consistent direction shift from northerly to easterly, aligning with the approach of a frontal boundary. These combined indicators point to an active weather pattern, with potential for overcast skies, increased cloud cover, and the possibility of rain or drizzle in the near term.
