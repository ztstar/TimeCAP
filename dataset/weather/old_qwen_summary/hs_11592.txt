Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady and significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the late night and early morning hours, indicating rising moisture content in the atmosphere, likely due to nocturnal cooling and potential low-level moisture advection. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the early morning hours, with a notable shift in wind direction from north-easterly to southerly, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation that may have facilitated moisture transport. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and increasing pressure suggests the atmosphere is becoming more stable, which could suppress storm development but may also promote fog formation during the early morning hours.
