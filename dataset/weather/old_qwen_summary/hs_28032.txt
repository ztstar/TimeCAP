Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp and sustained warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching near saturation overnight before plummeting during the day, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early hours, peaking mid-morning before stabilizing, which suggests the passage of a high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds increased steadily throughout the afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction toward the southwest, pointing to the influence of a developing surface pressure gradient. These combined factors signal a transition from a damp, cool night to a warmer, drier day, potentially increasing fire risk and affecting local air quality and comfort levels.
