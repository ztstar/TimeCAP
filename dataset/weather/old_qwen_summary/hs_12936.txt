Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady and significant warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a nocturnal temperature minimum to a diurnal peak. Humidity levels rose sharply in the pre-dawn and early morning hours, peaking near saturation, then declined rapidly during the day, suggesting the dissipation of moisture and a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, reaching a high point in the late afternoon and maintaining elevated levels, which is indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and early evening, with gusts reaching strong levels and wind direction shifting from variable to predominantly easterly and northeasterly, consistent with a developing surface flow associated with the high-pressure buildup. These combined patterns suggest the arrival of a stable, dry, and increasingly windy regime, likely bringing clearer skies and reduced chances of precipitation, though higher wind speeds could contribute to increased evaporation and heat stress during peak daytime hours.
