Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained elevated throughout, especially during the early morning hours, indicating persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely contributing to fog formation. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a gradual recovery, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought cooler, moister conditions. Wind speeds were generally light overnight, increasing significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns, possibly influenced by coastal dynamics. These conditions point to a typical marine layer influence, with fog, cool temperatures, and variable winds characteristic of San Francisco’s coastal climate, particularly during transitional periods.
