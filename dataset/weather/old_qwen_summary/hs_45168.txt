Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the pre-dawn and early morning periods, then plummeted in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend likely due to increased mixing and lower relative humidity from rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a consistent decline, particularly in the late evening and early morning, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and potential precipitation. Wind speeds increased during the overnight and early morning hours, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to southeasterly, indicating a change in the local flow pattern that could enhance moisture advection. The combination of warming temperatures, dropping pressure, and increasing wind activity suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day, especially if moisture returns.
