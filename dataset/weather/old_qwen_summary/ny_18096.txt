Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature drop occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a nocturnal cooling trend likely due to clear skies and low humidity. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass followed by drier conditions. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, then began to rise, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring improving weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early hours, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, consistent with a developing frontal passage. Combined, these indicators suggest a transition from a cooler, more humid night to a drier, stabilizing atmosphere, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions by midday.
