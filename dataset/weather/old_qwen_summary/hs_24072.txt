Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler night conditions to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight and early morning hours, remaining near saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist and increased moisture availability in the atmosphere. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred during the midday, coinciding with a shift in wind patterns and increased wind speeds, which may signal the approach of a weather system. Wind direction shifted from westerly to southerly and then to easterly during the evening, suggesting changing air mass dynamics, potentially linked to an approaching frontal boundary. Combined with rising temperatures and sustained high humidity, these conditions create a high likelihood of developing thunderstorms in the coming hours.
