Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog formation and reduced visibility during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a persistent weather pattern with no imminent large-scale system change. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted progressively from southwest to southeast, hinting at a possible change in airflow influenced by coastal dynamics. These conditions collectively suggest a marine layer influence, typical of San Francisco’s climate, with potential for lingering fog and cool, damp conditions through the early morning hours.
