Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, with multiple periods of near-saturated air, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating a strong potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the early to mid-day, followed by a slight decline in the late evening, suggesting a possible shift in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds were generally light during the night and early morning but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a significant surge toward the end of the period, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly. These patterns point to the possible influence of a passing frontal system, increasing the risk of unstable conditions, localized showers, or thunderstorms later in the evening.
