Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking during the pre-dawn hours before plummeting in the late morning, indicating a possible frontal passage or shift in air mass. Air pressure increased steadily through the night and early morning, reaching a peak before declining in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that later weakened. Wind speeds remained light during the early hours but intensified in the afternoon, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly, which may signal the arrival of a cold front. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more dynamic air mass, potentially leading to clearing skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
