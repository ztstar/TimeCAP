Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and made conditions feel noticeably cooler. A shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later to easterly directions, accompanied by increasing wind speeds in the early morning, suggests the influence of a coastal breeze or synoptic-scale flow changes. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period but showed a dip during the late night and early morning, potentially signaling a passing weather front. The combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and variable wind patterns points to a persistent marine layer, which is typical of San Francisco’s microclimate and may continue to impact visibility and comfort into the next day.
