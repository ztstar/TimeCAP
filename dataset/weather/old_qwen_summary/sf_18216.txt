Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before a slight recovery. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation, indicating prolonged moisture presence in the atmosphere, which is typical of coastal fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual downward trend, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting the influence of an approaching low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more southerly and then easterly, consistent with the development of onshore flow and fog infiltration. These conditions collectively point to a persistent marine layer, likely resulting in dense fog and cool, damp conditions across the city, especially in the early morning hours.
