Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure declined steadily through the night and early morning before stabilizing, signaling a weakening high-pressure system and possible development of low-level convergence. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction, particularly from southerly to easterly, hinting at a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. These combined patterns suggest the atmosphere was becoming increasingly unstable, raising the potential for scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
