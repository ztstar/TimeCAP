Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting a transition from a cooler overnight period to a milder daytime pattern. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp increase during the early morning and late evening, indicating possible fog formation and condensation, especially near coastal areas. Air pressure exhibited a pronounced decrease in the late evening, reaching a low point before rebounding, which may signal the passage of a weather front or atmospheric instability. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late evening and early night, peaking during the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, consistent with a change in airflow patterns typical of coastal upwelling or frontal passage. These dynamics suggest the influence of a marine layer and a developing weather system, likely contributing to overcast conditions and the potential for light drizzle or fog in the coming hours.
