Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight and remaining near minimum levels during early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking at saturation, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. Air pressure steadily increased through the night, reaching a high before beginning to decline again, suggesting a passing front or changing atmospheric stability. Wind speeds remained generally light except during the early morning and late evening, when gusts intensified, possibly due to localized thermal effects or shifting pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from easterly to southerly and then westerly suggests dynamic airflow changes, potentially signaling the influence of coastal upwelling or a developing sea breeze pattern.
