Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant overnight temperature drop. Humidity levels surged to near or at saturation during the early morning, suggesting conditions favorable for fog or mist formation, which likely persisted through the night into the early morning. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-evening, followed by a gradual decline, signaling a possible influence from a developing or passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained low overnight but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with directional shifts indicating a change in airflow patterns, possibly due to a frontal influence. These combined factors suggest a transition period in the weather, with potential for unstable conditions and a higher likelihood of precipitation in the coming hours.
