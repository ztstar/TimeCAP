Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that began in the early morning and intensified through the night. Humidity levels remained high during the early and late hours, peaking in the late evening, which likely contributed to a muggy feel and reduced comfort. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, accompanied by increasing wind speeds and a shift toward more southerly and westerly wind directions, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds reached their peak in the late evening and overnight, with strong gusts from the southwest, which could signal the onset of more active weather. Combined with the weakening pressure and rising wind, these trends point to the likelihood of precipitation or stormy conditions in the near future.
