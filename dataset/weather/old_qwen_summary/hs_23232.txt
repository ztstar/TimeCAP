Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a decline, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to a muggy atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable through most of the period, with a slight increase in the midday hours before a gradual drop in the evening, suggesting possible changes in atmospheric stability. Wind speeds increased toward the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, which may indicate the approach of a changing air mass. These combined patterns suggest the potential for developing thunderstorms or scattered showers later in the day, particularly if the warming trend continues with lingering moisture.
