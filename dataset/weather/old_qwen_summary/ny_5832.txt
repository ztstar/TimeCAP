Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined during the night and early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a significant cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early morning hours, peaking just before sunrise, which suggests the presence of dew point saturation and potential fog formation. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point in the early hours before stabilizing, signaling a possible passage of a low-pressure system. Wind activity remained minimal during the night but increased in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the west and south, potentially indicating a shift in air mass or frontal influence. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to an elevated chance of precipitation or overcast conditions in the near term.
