Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply through the night, peaking at saturation, which indicates a high likelihood of fog or dew formation and contributed to a muggy, oppressive feel. Air pressure continuously decreased, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, accompanied by a notable shift in wind direction from northeast to west-southwest, suggesting the influence of a frontal boundary. Collectively, these trends point to a developing storm system, increasing the potential for precipitation and thunderstorms in the near term.
