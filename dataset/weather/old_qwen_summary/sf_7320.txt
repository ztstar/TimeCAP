Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s marine layer. Air pressure exhibited a notable dip during the early morning, followed by a brief rise, suggesting a passing weather system that may have influenced the coastal conditions. Wind speeds remained generally calm throughout most of the period, with a brief lull and a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the south-southeast, consistent with onshore flow typical of coastal fog events. These patterns point to a strong marine layer influence, likely resulting in reduced visibility and cool, damp conditions, particularly during the early hours, which may continue to affect the city’s morning commute and outdoor activities.
