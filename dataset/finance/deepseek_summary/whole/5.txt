Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a strong upward trend, reflecting growing investor confidence, though with notable volatility near the midpoint. The VIX showed a pronounced decline, indicating reduced market fear and a shift toward complacency, despite brief spikes during periods of equity instability. Global equities, including the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, demonstrated resilience with steady gains, suggesting broad-based risk appetite across major regions. Gold and crude oil prices both advanced, signaling expectations of inflationary pressures and strengthening demand, while the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies—particularly the yen and yuan—point to shifting monetary policy expectations. Overall, the data suggests a favorable macro environment for risk assets, though elevated oil prices and currency fluctuations warrant close monitoring for potential policy tightening or trade-related headwinds.
