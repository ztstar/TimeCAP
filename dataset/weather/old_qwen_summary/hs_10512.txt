Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced persistently high humidity levels, suggesting saturated air conditions that favored cloud formation and limited diurnal temperature variation. A notable drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a stable nocturnal boundary layer with minimal solar heating early in the cycle. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, signaling the approach and establishment of a high-pressure system that typically brings fair and dry conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with brief spikes likely associated with localized convection or minor frontal adjustments, while wind direction shifted significantly from easterly to westerly, suggesting changing flow patterns near the surface. These combined indicators point to a transition toward drier and more stable conditions, though lingering moisture may still support isolated showers or fog during early morning hours.
