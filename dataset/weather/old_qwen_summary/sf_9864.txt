Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp temperature rise in the late afternoon, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely driven by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking near saturation, which contributed to dense fog formation and reduced visibility during the early morning. A notable increase in air pressure toward midday suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low and consistent overnight but surged in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained gusts from the south and southeast, potentially signaling the onset of a sea breeze or changing synoptic conditions. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast and later to the south-southeast aligns with the influence of regional circulation patterns, possibly indicating the influence of a coastal trough or the start of a wind shift typical of San Francisco’s microclimate.
