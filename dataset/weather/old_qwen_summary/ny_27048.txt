Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually rising through the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moisture-laden air and potential for fog or low visibility during the night. A notable rise in air pressure occurred in the mid-morning and persisted into the afternoon, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and fair weather. Wind speeds remained generally low except for a brief increase in the late afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then north, signaling a change in air mass. These trends collectively point to a transition from a moist, cooler night to a drier, clearer, and gradually warming day, consistent with the arrival of a stable high-pressure regime.
