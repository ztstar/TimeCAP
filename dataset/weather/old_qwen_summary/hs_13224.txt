Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels rose significantly in the late evening and overnight, peaking at saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or dew formation. Air pressure dropped steadily, especially during the mid-to-late night, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring stormy conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the early hours of the night, with stronger gusts and shifting wind directions, indicating dynamic atmospheric instability. These combined factors point to a developing weather system that may lead to precipitation and potentially thunderstorms in the near term.
