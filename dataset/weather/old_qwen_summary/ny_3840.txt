Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through mid-morning, indicating a saturated atmosphere likely associated with a low-pressure system. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rise during the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure ridge. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northerly to southerly and then easterly, signaling changing air mass dynamics. These patterns collectively suggest the passage of a cold front, followed by a gradual warming trend and improving conditions, potentially leading to clearer skies and more stable weather in the near term.
