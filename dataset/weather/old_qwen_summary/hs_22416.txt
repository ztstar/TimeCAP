Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing, indicating a transition toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking near saturation, which suggests increased moisture availability and potential for fog or drizzle in the early hours. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, particularly in the final hours, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably in the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with a developing frontal influence. These combined indicators suggest that Houston is entering a period of potentially unstable weather, with elevated chances of precipitation and overcast conditions in the near term.
