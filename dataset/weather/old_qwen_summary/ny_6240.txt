Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early hours, indicating the presence of moist air, likely associated with a passing front or precipitation event. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a slight decrease in the late afternoon, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure feature. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly, consistent with changing synoptic conditions. These indicators point to a transition in weather patterns, potentially signaling the arrival of a storm system or a change in air mass, which may bring unsettled conditions to New York City in the near term.
