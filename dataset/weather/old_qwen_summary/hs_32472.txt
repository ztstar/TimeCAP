Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of overnight condensation and a shift toward drier conditions during midday. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, stabilizing at a high level before a slight decline in the late evening, which may reflect the influence of a passing high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a consistent breeze during the night and early morning, shifting slightly in direction toward the southeast in the late evening—consistent with a weakening nocturnal inversion and possible onshore flow. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and shifting wind patterns hints at the potential for increased cloud development and possible afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
