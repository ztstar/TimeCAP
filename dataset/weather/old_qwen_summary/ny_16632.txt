Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a slow decrease, indicating a shift toward drier conditions. Air pressure remained stable through most of the night, then exhibited a slight downward trend in the late evening, suggesting the potential influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, particularly from the southeast, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that suggests a change in airflow patterns. These combined trends point to a transition period in the weather, with the possibility of increasing instability and potential for precipitation in the near term.
