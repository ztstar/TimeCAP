Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels rose sharply in the late evening and early morning, peaking during the early hours of the day, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, culminating in a high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and suppressed precipitation. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly in the morning, suggesting a change in air mass or approaching weather patterns. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and strengthening high pressure indicates clear skies and potentially crisp conditions in the coming hours, favorable for a dry and stable environment.
