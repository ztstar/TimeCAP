Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, suggesting a transition from nighttime cooling to daytime heating. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog and reduced visibility in the early hours. Air pressure showed a steady increase during the day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly directions, with speeds remaining generally light, suggesting a weakening frontal influence. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and a stabilizing pressure system points to a potential for increasing discomfort and possible thunderstorm development later in the day if moisture and lift continue to build.
