Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant nighttime cooling trend, followed by a gradual warming throughout the day, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking near saturation during early morning hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a passing frontal boundary or localized convection. Air pressure showed a steady rise through the night and early morning, culminating in a peak before a slight decline, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system or developing instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, consistent with the development of a sea breeze or moisture influx. These combined patterns point to a transition period in Houston’s weather, with increasing atmospheric instability and potential for afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
