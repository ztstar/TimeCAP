Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a slight cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the mid to upper 90s, indicating a saturated air mass that likely contributed to reduced visibility and a persistent damp feel. Air pressure exhibited a stable pattern with a brief drop toward the end of the period, suggesting possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeast to more southeasterly, hinting at a changing air mass. These conditions collectively point to a humid, potentially unsettled atmosphere, with increasing chances of precipitation or overcast skies in the near term.
