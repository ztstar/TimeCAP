Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually increasing during the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by coastal cooling. Humidity remained consistently high throughout the period, peaking in the early morning and persisting at elevated levels, which suggests the presence of marine layer conditions common in the region. Air pressure exhibited a gradual rise, particularly during midday and into the evening, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that generally brings stable and clear skies. Wind speeds were generally light, with brief increases in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by variable wind directions—suggesting shifting local circulation patterns, possibly due to terrain and sea-breeze influences. Taken together, the data indicate a stable, cool, and humid coastal environment with the potential for fog or low stratus development, especially during early morning hours.
