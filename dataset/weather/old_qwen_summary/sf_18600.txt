Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before gradually warming slightly during the afternoon. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking in the early morning hours and contributing to a damp, foggy atmosphere typical of the region’s microclimate. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, indicating the approach of a stable high-pressure system that likely suppressed cloud formation and supported clearer skies later in the day. Wind patterns shifted significantly around midday, with a strong southerly to easterly flow emerging, potentially bringing in maritime air and influencing fog dissipation. The combination of cooling temperatures, persistent moisture, and changing wind direction suggests a transition from foggy, cool conditions to clearer, milder weather as the high-pressure system consolidates.
