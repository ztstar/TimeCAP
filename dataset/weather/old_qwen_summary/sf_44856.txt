Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent temperature suggests a lack of significant thermal gradients or weather system movement, indicating a prolonged period of atmospheric stability. Extremely low humidity levels point to dry air, which may increase fire risk and contribute to rapid temperature changes during daylight hours. The steady wind from a southeasterly direction at a mild speed suggests a weak, persistent flow, likely influenced by regional high-pressure systems. This prolonged stability implies clear skies and minimal precipitation, typical of a dry, settled period common in the city’s microclimate during certain seasons.
