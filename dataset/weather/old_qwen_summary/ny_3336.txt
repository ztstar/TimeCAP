Temperature dropped steadily through the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels decreased significantly during the same period, indicating increasingly dry air, which likely contributed to a sharper temperature drop. Air pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the night, peaking in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds increased notably after midnight, with strong gusts from the northwest, consistent with the influence of a developing storm system. The shift in wind direction from northerly to more westerly and southerly directions in the late morning implies a change in airflow, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary and possible precipitation in the coming hours.
