Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the overnight period, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated, indicating a persistent moisture buildup in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night and early morning, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, reflecting changing circulation patterns. These conditions point to a transition from a moist, stable environment toward a drier, more stable air mass, potentially suppressing storm development but possibly leading to fog or low clouds early in the day.
