Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming as the day progressed, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity remained near saturation in the early hours, dropping significantly during midday before fluctuating, suggesting the presence of fog dissipation and subsequent air mass changes. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the late night and early morning, followed by a prolonged decline, which may signal the approach or passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified through the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts coming from the west and southwest, consistent with offshore flow or a developing sea breeze. The shift in wind direction from onshore to offshore patterns, combined with the pressure and temperature trends, points to evolving synoptic conditions that could lead to changing weather patterns in the coming hours.
