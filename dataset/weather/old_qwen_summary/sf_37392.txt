Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping substantially during the day, which suggests a transition from foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low point before rebounding in the late afternoon, indicating the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds increased sharply in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that aligns with a change in large-scale atmospheric flow. These patterns point to a developing synoptic-scale system bringing cooler, windier conditions, which may result in gusty winds and potential for coastal fog in the coming hours.
