Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature dip during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern influenced by nighttime radiative cooling and solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn before declining, suggesting the presence of moist air masses that may have contributed to fog or dew formation. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the early morning hours, followed by a sharp increase in the late morning, which may indicate the passage of a weather front or a low-pressure system moving through the region. Wind speeds remained low until midday, then intensified in the late afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more westerly and later northerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass or frontal influence. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, which could lead to clearer skies and reduced precipitation risk in the immediate hours ahead.
