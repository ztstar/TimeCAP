Over the past 24 hours, a notable cooling trend was observed during the early morning hours, followed by a steady temperature rise into the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of a warming air mass. Humidity levels remained relatively low during the morning but surged significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the passage of a moist air layer. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, stabilizing in the mid-range, which typically signals improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. A brief but strong wind event occurred in the early afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest, likely due to a passing frontal boundary. The subsequent return to calm, light winds and stable pressure suggests the system has stabilized, pointing to clear or partly cloudy conditions for the immediate future.
