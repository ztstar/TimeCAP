Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a consistent cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours before stabilizing, indicating a buildup of moisture likely due to fog formation. Air pressure steadily declined through the night, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southeast and east, potentially enhancing coastal fog advection and contributing to cooler conditions. The shift in wind direction from westerly to southeasterly suggests changing atmospheric flow, possibly related to a developing marine layer or frontal influence, which could prolong overcast skies and damp conditions into the coming hours.
