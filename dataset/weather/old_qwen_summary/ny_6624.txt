Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend that likely followed a shift in air mass. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of a moist air layer, possibly due to increasing solar heating and wind mixing. Air pressure showed a steady decline through the night and early morning, followed by a gradual stabilization, which may point to the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow, enhancing heat advection and contributing to the temperature rise. The combination of warming temperatures, falling humidity, and sustained wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer, more stable conditions, potentially signaling the end of a damp or overcast period.
