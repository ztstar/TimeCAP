Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to saturation during the overnight hours, persisting at or near 100% for several consecutive hours, indicating strong moisture accumulation and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure showed a consistent pattern of slight decline, particularly in the late evening, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased significantly in the afternoon, with a shift toward more southerly and easterly directions, which may signal the approach of a moist air mass from the Gulf. These conditions collectively point to a high likelihood of unstable atmospheric dynamics, increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms as temperatures rise and moisture remains abundant.
