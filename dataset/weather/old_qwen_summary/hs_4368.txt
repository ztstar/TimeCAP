Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a warming trend as daylight increased. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of mist or fog, before declining sharply during the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach and passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with calm or light winds, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the east and southeast, indicating a shift in circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a humid, stagnant night into a warmer, drier, and more ventilated day, consistent with the arrival of fair weather conditions.
