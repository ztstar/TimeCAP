Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period that culminated in elevated temperatures in the late afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, remaining consistently high through midday before declining during the afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the early morning, followed by a slow decline through midday, which may signal the approach of an atmospheric disturbance. Wind speeds increased steadily in the afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southeast, suggesting the influence of a developing low-pressure system or outflow boundary. Combined with shifting wind directions from the east to the southeast, these patterns point to an active weather transition that could lead to thunderstorm development later in the day.
