- Humidity (%): Humidity levels exhibited a pronounced overnight rise, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining through the midday and afternoon. A notable anomaly occurred in the early morning, with a rapid increase followed by a steep drop, indicating possible transition from a stable to an unstable air mass. The persistent low values in the late afternoon and evening suggest drying conditions, which may influence local microclimates and air quality dynamics.
- Air Pressure (hPa): The air pressure has exhibited a sustained downward trend over the past 24 hours, indicating the approaching influence of a low-pressure system, which is often associated with deteriorating weather conditions. A notable dip followed by a gradual recovery suggests a period of atmospheric instability, possibly linked to developing precipitation or storm activity. The sharp decline early in the period, followed by a rebound and stabilization, implies dynamic changes in the local atmospheric dynamics, warranting attention for potential weather disruptions.
- Temperature (Kelvin): Temperature exhibited a steady decline through the early hours, reaching a trough before reversing with a pronounced回升, peaking in the late afternoon. A notable anomaly occurred mid-morning, where a brief, unexpected dip was followed by a rapid recovery, suggesting a transient atmospheric disturbance. The subsequent gradual cooling into the evening indicates the onset of nightfall conditions, consistent with normal diurnal patterns.
- Wind Speed (m/s): Wind speed exhibited a steady increase over the past 24 hours, beginning with stable low-level values before accelerating significantly during the latter half of the period. A notable surge occurred in the final six hours, reaching peak levels followed by fluctuating but elevated readings, suggesting the onset of stronger prevailing winds. This pattern indicates a developing weather system, potentially a frontal passage or developing storm influence, which may lead to gusty conditions and increased wind-related impacts in the region.
- Wind Direction (degrees): Wind direction exhibited a shift from southerly to westerly and then to a strong northerly component over the past 24 hours, indicating a significant change in prevailing airflow. A notable abrupt transition occurred around the 12th hour, where the wind swung from a southerly to a northerly quadrant, suggesting the passage of a weather front or a shift in pressure systems. The sustained westerly to northwesterly flow in the final hours implies ongoing influence from a high-pressure system to the north, potentially leading to stable and cooler conditions.
