Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend followed by a gradual warming, indicating a transition from nocturnal low temperatures to a morning rise. Humidity levels surged during the night and early morning, peaking near dawn before sharply declining, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, signaling generally stable atmospheric conditions without significant storm systems. Wind speeds were moderate overnight, decreasing to near calm during the early morning hours, then increasing again in the afternoon, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing airflow patterns. These trends suggest a coastal fog event that burned off during the day, consistent with typical San Francisco microclimate behavior, potentially leading to clearer skies and milder conditions in the coming hours.
