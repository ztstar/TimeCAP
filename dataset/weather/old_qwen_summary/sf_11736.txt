Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend through the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before beginning a gradual recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning and overnight hours, indicating potential fog formation, which then declined sharply in the afternoon as conditions warmed. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds showed notable variability, with a significant surge in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and southwest, which likely contributed to the mixing of air and the dissipation of fog. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly patterns reflects dynamic atmospheric adjustments, consistent with coastal influences and the daily sea breeze cycle.
