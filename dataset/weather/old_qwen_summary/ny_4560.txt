Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining as temperatures climbed, indicating a drying trend. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, followed by a stabilization and a slight rebound, suggesting a passing weather system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the southwest and west, likely driven by a developing low-pressure influence. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests a transition in air mass, potentially bringing clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
