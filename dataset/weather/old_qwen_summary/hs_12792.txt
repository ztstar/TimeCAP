Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, indicating a moist air mass, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. A significant rise in atmospheric pressure suggests the influence of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, but increased in the late afternoon, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. These conditions point to a transition period with diminishing moisture and improving clarity, setting the stage for a more comfortable and stable day ahead.
