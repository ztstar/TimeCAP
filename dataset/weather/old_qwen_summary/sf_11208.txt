Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a strong diurnal cycle likely influenced by coastal fog and solar heating. Humidity levels showed a sharp decline during mid-morning, suggesting the dissipation of fog, but surged again in the evening, coinciding with a return of moist air and increased cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a notable drop in the late morning, followed by a recovery, hinting at the passage of a weak weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased markedly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southeast, signaling a change in atmospheric circulation that may contribute to onshore flow and fog formation. These conditions collectively suggest a dynamic coastal weather pattern typical of San Francisco, with frequent fog, variable winds, and temperature fluctuations driven by marine influences.
