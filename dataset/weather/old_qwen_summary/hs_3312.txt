Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s climate. Relative humidity showed a pronounced increase overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining through the day, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the night and early morning, plateauing in the mid-morning, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds decreased significantly overnight, with a shift from strong northerly to westerly and then southerly flow in the late afternoon, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. The combination of falling humidity, rising pressure, and shifting wind direction suggests improving weather conditions, with a likely transition to drier and more stable air in the coming hours.
