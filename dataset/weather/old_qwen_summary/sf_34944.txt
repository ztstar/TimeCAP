Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced overnight cooling trend followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of coastal regions. Humidity levels remained low during the early morning and midday, peaking significantly in the late night and early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability during cooler periods, possibly due to fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the night and early morning, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, which may signal the approach of a low-pressure system influencing the area. Wind activity was generally light, with brief bursts of moderate wind associated with shifts in wind direction, particularly from the west and southwest, consistent with onshore flow that often brings fog and marine layer conditions. The combination of cooling temperatures, rising humidity, and northerly/southwesterly wind shifts strongly indicates the presence and evolution of a marine layer, likely responsible for fog and overcast conditions, especially during early morning hours.
