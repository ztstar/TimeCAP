Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity remained near saturation throughout the period, indicating persistent moisture in the air and a high likelihood of fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily increased, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable, clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low, with light to moderate breezes from variable directions, particularly shifting toward the northeast in the late afternoon. These conditions point to a transition from a cool, damp, and foggy phase toward more stable and slightly warmer weather, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic patterns.
