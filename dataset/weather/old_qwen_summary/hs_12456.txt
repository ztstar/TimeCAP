Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, particularly during late afternoon and early evening, indicating a significant warming trend likely driven by solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels remained elevated through the early and mid-day hours, followed by a sharp decline in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend that may be associated with a shift in air mass or the approach of a drier front. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point in the final hours, which is often indicative of an approaching low-pressure system or potential for unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeast to more variable patterns, including southerly and westerly flows, hinting at changing circulation dynamics. These combined factors suggest a transition toward potentially unsettled weather, with increased risk of thunderstorms or showers later in the day.
