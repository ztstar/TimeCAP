Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a diurnal pattern influenced by nocturnal radiative cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours, then gradually declined through the midday before rebounding in the late evening—suggesting possible nocturnal moisture accumulation and evaporation cycles. Air pressure showed a stable to slightly rising trend overall, with a notable increase during the late afternoon, which may signal the approach or passage of a high-pressure system that could stabilize conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more southerly and then westerly over time, potentially reflecting changing flow patterns associated with a developing or moving weather front. Collectively, these trends point to a transition period in Houston's weather, with lingering moisture and shifting wind patterns possibly setting the stage for increased chances of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
