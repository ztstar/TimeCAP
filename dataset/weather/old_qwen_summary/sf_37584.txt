Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually rebounding in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the early morning hours, indicating strong fog formation, which likely contributed to the temperature drop and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable increase in the early hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have brought clearer skies later in the day. Wind speeds were generally low overnight, but increased slightly in the early morning, with shifting wind directions indicating a change in atmospheric flow, possibly linked to coastal dynamics or a passing front. The combination of persistent fog, temperature inversions, and variable wind patterns points to a classic coastal weather regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, with potential implications for travel and daily outdoor activities.
