Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the lowest temperature period. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the pre-dawn hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction and increased wind speeds later in the day, hinting at the passage of a weather front or low-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts from the west and southwest, possibly bringing in drier air and contributing to the observed decline in humidity. These patterns point to dynamic atmospheric changes, with the potential for unstable conditions later in the day, including possible thunderstorm development as daytime heating resumes.
