Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before gradually rising. A sharp increase in humidity, peaking near saturation, coincided with the lowest temperatures, indicating the potential for fog or dew formation during the early hours. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled conditions. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to stronger gusts, particularly in the late evening and early morning, with a notable change in direction indicating a change in air mass. These combined factors point to an active weather transition, likely resulting in overcast skies and possible precipitation in the near term.
