Influenza activity has shown a steady and accelerating increase over the past 20 weeks, with both influenza A and B strains contributing significantly to rising positivity rates. The proportion of positive specimens has more than doubled in recent weeks, indicating a surge in circulation, particularly in the last 6–8 weeks. Influenza A has consistently accounted for the majority of positive cases, but the relative contribution of Influenza B has also grown substantially, suggesting co-circulation of both lineages at elevated levels. A notable decline in positivity rates occurred in the most recent week, which may reflect a temporary plateau or potential waning of the peak phase, though levels remain high compared to baseline. These trends highlight a significant ongoing respiratory virus burden, warranting heightened surveillance, public health messaging, and consideration of vaccination and clinical preparedness.
