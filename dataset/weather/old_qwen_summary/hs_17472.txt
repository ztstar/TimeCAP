Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend in temperature, with the lowest values recorded during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated throughout the day, indicating a saturated atmosphere conducive to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained stable for much of the period before showing a gradual decline in the late afternoon, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring precipitation. Wind speeds were light and variable during the early hours, increasing steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to southeasterly, consistent with a developing onshore flow. These trends collectively suggest increasing instability and the potential for thunderstorms later in the day, particularly with the combination of high moisture, warming temperatures, and increasing wind shear.
