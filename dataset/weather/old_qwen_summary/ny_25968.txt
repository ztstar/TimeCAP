Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, suggesting the passage of a cold front. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility during the early hours. A notable decrease in air pressure in the early morning hours coincided with increased wind speeds and a shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest, indicating the influence of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds remained elevated during the night and early morning, then decreased during the afternoon, with gusts likely associated with the frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind patterns points to a period of unsettled weather, potentially bringing precipitation in the near term.
