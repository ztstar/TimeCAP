Over the past 24 hours, a steady decline in air pressure indicates the approach of a low-pressure system, which is typically associated with deteriorating weather conditions. Temperature trends show a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, suggesting a buildup of heat, potentially leading to increased instability in the atmosphere. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with prolonged periods of high moisture content, especially during nighttime hours, increasing the likelihood of fog or drizzle. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, particularly from the southwest, which may signal the onset of a stronger frontal passage. Together, these indicators suggest a transition toward unsettled weather, with possible precipitation and gusty conditions expected in the near term.
