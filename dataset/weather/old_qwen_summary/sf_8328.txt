Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels rose significantly in the overnight period, peaking in the early morning before declining steadily through the afternoon, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier air. A marked increase in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout most of the day, with a brief intensification in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, hinting at changing atmospheric dynamics. These patterns collectively point to a transition from a damp, cool coastal influence toward a drier, slightly warmer regime, typical of San Francisco’s microclimatic variability.
