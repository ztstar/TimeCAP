Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise into the afternoon, indicating a pronounced diurnal cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels surged during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, suggesting the influence of nocturnal cooling and potential moisture accumulation near the surface. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late afternoon, signaling the approach or presence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind patterns shifted dramatically around dawn, with a sudden change in direction and a notable reduction in speed, followed by stronger, more consistent easterly winds in the afternoon—indicative of a developing sea breeze circulation. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable nocturnal environment to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime regime, which may increase the risk of afternoon thunderstorms if additional moisture and lift are introduced.
