Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures steadily declining through the early morning hours before beginning a gradual回升. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the development of fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a consistent increase through the night, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that is helping to stabilize conditions and suppress precipitation. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, but wind direction shifted notably from the southwest to the northwest, suggesting a change in air mass and possibly the onset of a more northerly flow. These combined factors point to a transition toward clearer skies and cooler, drier conditions in the coming hours, with reduced chances of fog as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
