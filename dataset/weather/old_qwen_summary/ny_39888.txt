Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before beginning a gradual recovery, indicating a cooling trend overnight followed by a warming phase. Humidity levels rose significantly during the late night and early morning, peaking near dawn, which suggests increasing moisture in the atmosphere and potential for fog or drizzle. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night, with the lowest readings recorded in the early morning, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning and late evening, with stronger gusts from the northeast and east, consistent with frontal activity and storm development. Combined, these trends point to a dynamic weather transition, likely bringing precipitation and potentially stormy conditions in the near term.
