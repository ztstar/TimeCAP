Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures reaching a minimum during the early morning hours before gradually rising. Humidity levels showed a pronounced increase during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, indicating a transition from moist to drier air. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the period, signaling the approach and arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds remained moderate, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from west-northwest to northeast, suggesting changing circulation patterns. These combined trends point to a transition from a damp, cooler overnight period to a drier, more stable afternoon with improving conditions, likely resulting in clearer skies and a more comfortable feel as the day progressed.
