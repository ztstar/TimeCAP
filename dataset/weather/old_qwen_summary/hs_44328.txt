Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before beginning a gradual rise during the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked decline during the late night and early morning, reaching a minimum before increasing slightly in the late afternoon, suggesting a drying trend followed by a potential return of moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then gradually decreased through the afternoon, indicating a possible weakening of high-pressure control and an opening for more dynamic weather. Wind speeds diminished significantly overnight and remained low through the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northwest to more variable and southerly patterns later in the day, reflecting a change in local circulation. These combined trends suggest the approach of a weakening high-pressure system, potentially allowing for increased humidity and unstable conditions later in the day.
