Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature rise during midday, followed by a gradual cooling in the evening, suggesting a diurnal pattern influenced by solar heating and coastal moderation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a sharp drop in the afternoon, followed by a return to high values overnight, indicating possible shifts in air mass or fog dissipation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds showed a pronounced peak in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest, consistent with coastal upslope or offshore flow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather, with reduced fog and stronger winds likely impacting coastal areas.
