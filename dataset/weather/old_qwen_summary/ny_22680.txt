Temperature trends indicate a significant drop during the night, followed by a gradual recovery through the morning and into the afternoon, suggesting a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nighttime radiative cooling. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in air mass or a drying trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the midday hours, followed by a minor drop, signaling a transition that may precede a change in weather conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to more northerly and then easterly, hinting at a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined patterns suggest the passage of a cold front, with cooling temperatures, increasing humidity, and a shift in wind flow, potentially leading to clearer skies and cooler conditions in the coming hours.
