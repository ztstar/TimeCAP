Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A significant increase in wind speed occurred in the late night and early morning, with gusts from the southwest and southeast, suggesting the influence of a marine air intrusion. Air pressure showed a brief rise midday, followed by a notable drop in the late evening, signaling a possible approaching weather system. The combination of high moisture, cooling temperatures, and shifting wind patterns points to a likely continuation of foggy and cool conditions into the early part of the next day.
