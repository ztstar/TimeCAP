Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily after midnight, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to a dense fog or mist during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may have facilitated the increased moisture and reduced visibility. Wind patterns shifted from consistent easterly flow to a more variable direction by late evening, with a sudden increase in speed and a change in direction suggesting a developing disturbance. These conditions point to a transition toward potentially unstable weather, with a heightened risk of showers or thunderstorms in the near term.
