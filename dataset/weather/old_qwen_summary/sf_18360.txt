Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more variable conditions. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the night and early morning, with a notable lull around midday, but increased again in the evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northeasterly to more southerly and westerly, suggesting changing airflow patterns. These trends collectively point to a transition from foggy, cool conditions to a clearer, drier afternoon, with potential for continued stable weather in the coming hours.
