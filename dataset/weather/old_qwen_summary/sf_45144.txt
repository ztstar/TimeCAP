The weather in San Francisco over the past 24 hours has been characterized by remarkably stable conditions across all key indicators. Temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction have remained constant, indicating a persistent and unchanging air mass over the region. The consistently low humidity suggests dry air, which may contribute to increased fire risk, especially if this pattern continues. The steady wind from a southeasterly direction implies a stable synoptic setup, likely influenced by a high-pressure system positioned offshore. This prolonged stability could lead to limited cloud development and clear skies, potentially enhancing daytime heating and evening cooling.
