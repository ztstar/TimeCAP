Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery through the afternoon and evening, indicating a clear diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained low during the early hours, sharply increased in the late night and early morning, then steadily decreased as the day progressed, suggesting a transition from moist to drier conditions. Air pressure steadily rose throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon and holding steady into the evening, which is indicative of an approaching high-pressure system bringing stable, clear weather. Wind speeds were minimal during the early morning hours, increasing significantly in the afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends suggest the arrival of a drier, more stable air mass, likely leading to improved visibility and comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
