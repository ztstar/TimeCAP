Temperatures dropped significantly during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by overnight cooling. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting near-saturation conditions that likely contributed to fog or mist, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that brought the overnight conditions. Wind speeds increased during the late afternoon and early evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and then northwest, indicating a change in atmospheric flow associated with the approaching high-pressure system. These combined trends suggest a transition from a cold, damp, and stable night to a progressively clearer and drier day, with improving conditions as the high pressure consolidates.
