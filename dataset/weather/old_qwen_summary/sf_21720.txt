Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking above 95% and remaining elevated into the early hours, indicating a strong marine influence and potential for fog formation. Air pressure remained nearly constant until midday, then declined steadily, suggesting an approaching weather system or low-pressure shift. Wind speeds were minimal during the night, with near-zero conditions through the early morning, but increased slightly in the late afternoon, accompanying a notable shift in wind direction from westerly to southerly and later northerly. These combined patterns point to a transition period with lingering coastal fog and the potential for changing conditions later in the day, possibly including increased wind and variable precipitation.
