Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, indicating a transition from stable nighttime conditions to drier, warmer air. A notable drop in air pressure occurred during the night, particularly in the early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system that may have contributed to increased cloud cover and moisture. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then toward the north-northeast, with intermittent gusts, potentially signaling the influence of a frontal boundary. The combination of rising humidity, falling pressure, and variable wind directions points to an active weather environment, possibly increasing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
