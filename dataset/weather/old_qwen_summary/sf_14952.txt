Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during daylight, suggesting the presence of marine layer conditions that typically form at night and dissipate with solar heating. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, followed by a recovery later in the day, which may signal the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds remained low through the night and early morning, increasing slightly in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from westerly to more southerly, potentially indicating changing synoptic-scale flow. These trends collectively suggest a typical coastal fog cycle, with marine influence dominating the local weather, likely contributing to cool, damp conditions in the early hours and a gradual clearing trend by late evening.
