Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at saturation before dropping steadily as temperatures increased, indicating possible nocturnal condensation and dew formation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that likely contributed to clearing skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then to easterly, reflecting changing air mass dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and light winds points to improving weather conditions, with reduced likelihood of precipitation and increasing comfort levels during the day.
