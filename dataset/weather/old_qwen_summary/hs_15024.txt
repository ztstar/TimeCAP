Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked in the overnight and early morning period, indicating a period of high moisture content, likely contributing to a damp and muggy feel. Air pressure showed a significant surge during the early to mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a strong high-pressure system that may have stabilized conditions and suppressed storm development. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to more northerly and easterly in the late evening, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a boundary. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the near term.
