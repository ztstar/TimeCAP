Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend overnight, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before sharply declining, suggesting the onset of a drying trend likely due to increasing wind and solar heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, though a brief drop occurred in the early hours, possibly signaling a passing weather feature. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the night, increasing slightly in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west-southwest, indicating a change in local flow patterns. These conditions point to a typical marine layer influence, with the potential for fog or low clouds in the early morning and clearer skies later in the day.
