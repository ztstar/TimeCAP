Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cool nighttime low. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping during the day, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that may have contributed to fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the late morning and early evening, pointing to the influence of a high-pressure system that generally supports fair weather. Wind speeds were moderate, with a notable increase during the night and early morning, shifting from west to northwest directions, which likely brought in cooler air from inland regions. The combination of rising humidity, moderate winds, and stable pressure suggests a transition toward clearer skies later in the day, with potential for comfortable conditions in the afternoon.
