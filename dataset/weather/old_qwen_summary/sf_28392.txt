Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early hours, peaking in the pre-dawn period, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature suppression. Air pressure rose steadily throughout the day, indicating the influence of a stable high-pressure system that may be suppressing storm development and promoting clear skies in the coming hours. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more variable patterns, which may reflect changing boundary layer dynamics associated with the coastal influence. These conditions collectively suggest a calm, cool, and potentially foggy environment typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, especially in the early morning, with a gradual transition toward clearer and slightly warmer conditions later in the day.
