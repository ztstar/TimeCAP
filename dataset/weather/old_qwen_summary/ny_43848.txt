Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low in the early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which suggests moisture accumulation and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, indicating the influence of a high-pressure system that generally brings fair weather. Wind patterns shifted notably around dawn, with a sudden change in direction toward the northeast and a brief increase in speed, possibly signaling a frontal passage or local circulation shift. The combination of rising humidity, steady pressure, and variable winds suggests a transition period, with conditions potentially conducive to scattered showers or a brief period of overcast skies later in the day.
