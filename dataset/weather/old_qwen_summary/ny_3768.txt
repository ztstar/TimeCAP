Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low before beginning a gradual recovery during the morning and afternoon hours. Humidity levels remained moderate initially, then surged significantly in the late evening, indicating increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a notable rise in the early morning, followed by a sharp spike mid-day, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies. Wind speeds decreased substantially during the late night and early morning, coinciding with a shift to calm conditions and a change in wind direction from northerly to southerly, which may signal a change in air mass. These indicators collectively point to a transition in weather patterns, with the potential for improved conditions later in the day as the high-pressure influence strengthens.
