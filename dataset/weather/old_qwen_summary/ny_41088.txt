Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before beginning a slow decline, suggesting increased moisture availability in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure steadily increased through the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining, which is often associated with the passage of a high-pressure system bringing stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase in the final hours, particularly from the northwest and west, likely due to a strengthening pressure gradient. Combined, these trends suggest improving weather with drier, more stable conditions ahead, potentially leading to clearer skies and cooler nights.
