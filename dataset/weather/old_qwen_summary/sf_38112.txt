Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable shift in atmospheric stability, marked by fluctuating air pressure and rising humidity, particularly during the early morning and late evening hours. Temperature remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting a persistent marine layer influence, typical of the region’s coastal climate. Wind patterns showed strong onshore flow in the afternoon, followed by a shift to more variable and sometimes gusty conditions, indicating changes in local wind dynamics. Elevated humidity levels coincided with periods of low pressure and variable wind direction, increasing the likelihood of fog formation and reduced visibility. The combination of high moisture, moderate temperatures, and shifting wind directions suggests a high probability of foggy conditions, especially during the early morning hours, which may impact commuting and outdoor activities.
