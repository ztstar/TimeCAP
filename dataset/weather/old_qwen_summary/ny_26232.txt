Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high initially, dropped significantly midday, and then fluctuated, suggesting a shift in air mass and possible changes in cloud cover or precipitation potential. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise again, which is indicative of a passing low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts and a shift in wind direction from southeast to northeast, signaling dynamic atmospheric conditions. These combined factors suggest the passage of a frontal system, potentially bringing unsettled weather, including showers or storms, later in the day.
