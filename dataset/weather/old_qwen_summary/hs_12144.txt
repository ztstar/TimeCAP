Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily through the day before moderating slightly in the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the night and early morning, dropping significantly during the afternoon before rebounding late in the cycle, suggesting a possible afternoon moistening phase. Air pressure showed a notable decline in the early morning hours, followed by a recovery and subsequent stabilization, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the mid-to-late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, aligning with a shift in wind direction that suggests an influx of moist air. These combined patterns point to a developing convective environment, increasing the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms, particularly during peak heating hours.
