Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before declining into the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during midday, followed by a marked increase in the evening, indicating a shift in moisture content likely tied to changing air masses. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline through the night, stabilizing in the early morning, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds intensified during midday and again in the late evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest and west sectors, consistent with marine layer dynamics. These combined patterns point to a transition period influenced by coastal upwelling and shifting wind patterns, potentially leading to fog development and cooler conditions later in the day.
