Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable shift in atmospheric pressure, with a steady rise starting in the early morning, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system. Temperature trends showed a cooling period during the night followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon, suggesting a stable boundary layer forming. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, then dropped sharply in the afternoon, pointing to a drying trend as the high-pressure system strengthened. Wind speeds decreased significantly during the night and early morning, then increased again in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from southeast to northeast, consistent with a change in airflow due to the high-pressure influence. These combined patterns suggest the end of a period of damp, muggy conditions and the onset of drier, more stable weather, with reduced chances of precipitation.
