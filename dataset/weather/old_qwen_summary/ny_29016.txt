Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery in the afternoon, indicating a cold front passage. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during the late night and early morning, suggesting drier air infiltration, though elevated humidity returned in the late afternoon, coinciding with a rise in temperature. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the evening, which is indicative of a high-pressure system influencing the region and likely bringing stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to strong in the early morning, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to more westerly and then southerly, signaling a change in airflow associated with the approaching high-pressure system. Overall, the data suggests a transition from cold, dry conditions to a milder, potentially clearer period, with reduced chances of precipitation.
