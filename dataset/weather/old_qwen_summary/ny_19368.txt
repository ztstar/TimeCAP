Temperatures showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a low before gradually rising in the late morning, indicating a cold nocturnal period followed by a modest warming trend. Humidity levels dropped significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting dry air intrusion, before increasing slightly in the late evening, possibly signaling the approach of a moisture-laden air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon and remaining high, which typically indicates stable, fair weather conditions with little chance of storms. Wind speeds were moderate during most of the day but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction toward the northwest and west, hinting at a change in air mass dynamics. These combined indicators suggest a transition from a cool, dry, and stable air mass to one that may be more variable, potentially setting the stage for changing conditions later in the day.
