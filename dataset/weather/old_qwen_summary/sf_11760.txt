Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining slightly in the late afternoon, indicating a shift toward drier air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to improving conditions. Wind speeds were strongest in the early morning, diminishing to near calm during the night, with wind direction shifting from predominantly westward to variable and then southerly in the late evening. These patterns point to a transition from coastal fog and cool marine influence to clearer, more stable conditions as the high-pressure system consolidated.
