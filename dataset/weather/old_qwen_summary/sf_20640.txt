Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady decline in temperature followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a period of cooling overnight and a slow warming trend in the morning. Humidity remained consistently high throughout, particularly during the early morning hours, suggesting persistent moisture in the atmosphere, likely linked to coastal fog formation. Air pressure steadily increased, reflecting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system moving in from the Pacific, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly over time, with the breeze shifting from a strong westerly to a much lighter northeasterly flow, signaling a weakening of offshore wind patterns. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and high humidity points to a transition toward calmer, fog-prone conditions typical of San Francisco’s microclimate, especially in the morning hours.
