Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning and remained near maximum until midday, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to fog or low-lying clouds. A notable increase in air pressure during the late afternoon and evening signals the approach of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds remained low until late evening, when they sharply increased, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly, indicating a change in air mass and potential for a frontal passage. These combined trends point to a transition in weather, with possible clearing skies and cooler conditions ahead, though lingering moisture could support scattered showers if instability develops.
