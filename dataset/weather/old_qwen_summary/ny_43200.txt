Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined, indicating a significant cooling trend, likely due to the influence of a cold front moving through the region. Humidity levels rose sharply during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or light precipitation during those hours. Air pressure showed a gradual increase, particularly in the latter half of the period, signaling improving weather conditions and the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained relatively low during the early hours but intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction that indicates changing air mass dynamics. Together, these trends point to a transition from a moist, stable air mass to a cooler, drier, and more stable environment, likely resulting in clearer skies and more comfortable conditions by morning.
