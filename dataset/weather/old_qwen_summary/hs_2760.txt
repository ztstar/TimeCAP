Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high through the night, peaking at saturation, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or mist formation during the early hours. A notable drop in air pressure occurred in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring instability and precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon, with stronger gusts from the southwest, likely associated with the developing weather system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to southeasterly and then to more westerly sectors suggests a change in atmospheric flow, potentially signaling the passage of a front that could influence upcoming storm development.
