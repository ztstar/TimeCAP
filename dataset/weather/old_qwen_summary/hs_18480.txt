Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before gradually decreasing, indicating a period of moisture accumulation likely tied to nocturnal condensation or frontal influence. Air pressure showed a consistent upward trend, particularly after midday, suggesting the approach or passage of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished through the night, reaching a minimum during the early morning, followed by a gradual increase in the late afternoon, with wind direction shifting from a southerly to a more west-to-northwesterly flow, signaling a change in air mass. These combined patterns point to a transition from a humid, stagnant nighttime environment to a drier, more stable daytime regime, likely leading to improved comfort and reduced risk of thunderstorms in the near term.
