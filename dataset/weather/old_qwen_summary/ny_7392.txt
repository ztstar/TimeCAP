Over the past 24 hours, temperatures showed a steady decline overnight, reaching a minimum in the early morning before gradually warming through the day. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night, peaking in the early hours, indicating a significant increase in moisture content in the air. Air pressure steadily rose through the night and into the morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the early morning hours, with near-calm conditions observed, followed by a return to light winds in the late afternoon. The shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast in the early morning and back to northwest by evening hints at a possible change in air mass, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns.
