Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady nighttime cooling followed by a gradual warming trend during the day, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal moderation. Humidity levels remained high during the early morning and overnight hours before dropping significantly during midday, suggesting the onset of clearer skies and reduced moisture. A consistent rise in air pressure throughout the period reflects the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which generally brings stable and dry conditions. Wind speeds were generally low at night but increased during the afternoon, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, with shifts in wind direction indicating changing air flow patterns likely tied to sea breeze development. These combined factors point to a transition toward more comfortable and stable weather, with a likely reduction in fog and improved visibility as the high-pressure ridge consolidates.
