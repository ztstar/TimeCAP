Over the past 24 hours, a significant drop in temperature occurred during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating a transition from a cooler, stable period to a more moderate phase. Humidity levels surged to saturation (100%) during early morning hours, coinciding with a notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction, suggesting the arrival of a moist air mass. Air pressure exhibited a sharp decline during the night, followed by a rise, which may signal the passage of a frontal system or low-pressure disturbance. Wind patterns shifted from light and variable to stronger and more persistent, particularly from the west and northwest, likely contributing to the dispersion of moist air and potential for precipitation. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather transition, increasing the likelihood of unsettled conditions, including possible showers or thunderstorms, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.
