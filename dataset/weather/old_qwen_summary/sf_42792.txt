Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained exceptionally high during the night and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds, which likely contributed to the temperature dip. A consistent shift in wind direction from the southwest to the west and northwest during the evening suggests a change in air mass, possibly bringing in drier air. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly from the northwest, which may have helped disperse fog and reduce humidity. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer and more stable conditions later in the day.
