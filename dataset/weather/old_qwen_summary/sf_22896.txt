Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, particularly during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before beginning to decline, indicating the presence of fog or low clouds that likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring increased cloud cover and potential for precipitation. Wind speeds remained low to moderate during the night and early morning, shifting from a southerly to a westerly direction and then intensifying slightly in the late afternoon, possibly indicating a change in atmospheric dynamics. These combined patterns suggest a maritime influence with coastal fog and a developing weather system that could lead to overcast conditions and light rain later in the day.
