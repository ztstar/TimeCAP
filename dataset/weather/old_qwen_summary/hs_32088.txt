Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, reaching saturation before sharply declining during the afternoon, indicating a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more unstable one. Air pressure dropped steadily through the night, bottomed out in the early morning, and began to rise again in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind patterns shifted from consistent southerly to variable directions, with a notable increase in speed and a change to more westerly and northwesterly flows in the late afternoon, potentially signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. These conditions collectively point to the influence of a passing weather system, with the potential for developing thunderstorms later in the day as warm, moist air interacts with the approaching upper-level dynamics.
