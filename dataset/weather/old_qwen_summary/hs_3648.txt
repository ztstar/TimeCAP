Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining sharply during the day, indicating a transition from dry nocturnal conditions to more humid daytime air. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching notable levels, particularly from a westerly to northwesterly direction, signaling a shift in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors point to a drying trend following a period of cooling and increasing stability, likely resulting in improved visibility and reduced risk of precipitation in the immediate forecast.
