Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating a warming trend likely driven by solar heating and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, reflecting a saturated boundary layer, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting clear skies and drying air. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and into the morning, reaching a low point before gradually stabilizing, which may signal the passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the evening, particularly from the west-southwest, suggesting the influence of a developing frontal boundary or gusty outflow. Combined, these patterns point to a transition from a cool, humid overnight period to a warmer, drier, and increasingly windy day, with potential for unstable conditions and scattered showers later in the day.
