Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City exhibited a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels surged significantly overnight, peaking at saturation during the early hours, which likely contributed to dense fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, followed by a notable rise in the late afternoon and evening, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally low during the night but increased notably in the late evening, particularly from the northwest, suggesting a shift in atmospheric dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, increasing wind speeds, and a shift in wind direction signals a transition toward clearer, drier conditions, likely bringing improved weather into the coming hours.
