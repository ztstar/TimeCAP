Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early morning, reaching near saturation, which likely contributed to a damp and muggy feel, before dropping steadily as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a notable decline in the late afternoon, indicating possible approaching atmospheric instability. Wind speeds were light throughout most of the period, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly and southeasterly, suggesting a change in air mass flow. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and decreasing pressure late in the cycle suggests the potential for developing convective activity later in the day.
