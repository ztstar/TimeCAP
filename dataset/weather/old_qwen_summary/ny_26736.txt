Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a significant diurnal cycle. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog and reduced visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and morning, suggesting the approach of a stable high-pressure system that has since begun to weaken, as evidenced by a sharp decline toward the end of the period. Wind speeds remained low during most of the night but intensified significantly in the final hours, with a notable increase in wind speed and a shift in wind direction toward the southeast, signaling a change in air mass. These combined trends point to the transition from a cool, moist nocturnal environment to a warmer, drier, and more dynamic daytime pattern, potentially setting the stage for clearer skies and gusty conditions in the coming hours.
