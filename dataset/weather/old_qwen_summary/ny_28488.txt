Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the early morning hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the day. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early hours, peaking near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low-lying clouds. Air pressure remained relatively stable through much of the night and early morning, followed by a slight rise in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift toward more stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were moderate throughout, with a notable increase in the late evening, particularly from the northwest, suggesting the arrival of a changing air mass. The shift in wind direction from the northwest to the southwest in the final hours may signal the approach of a new weather system, potentially bringing variable conditions in the near term.
