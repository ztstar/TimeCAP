Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming phase through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, stabilizing during the midday hours, which typically indicates improving weather and fair conditions. Wind patterns shifted from predominantly light to the northeast during the night to stronger, more variable flows in the afternoon, including a brief surge from the southeast, possibly signaling a change in air mass or the approach of a weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and fluctuating winds suggests a transition toward more stable, sunny conditions later in the day, potentially reducing the risk of afternoon thunderstorms.
