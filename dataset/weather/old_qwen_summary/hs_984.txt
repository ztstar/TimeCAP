Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a steady rise through the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to warmer daytime patterns. Humidity levels exhibited a sharp increase during the same early morning period, remaining elevated before gradually declining, suggesting the influence of overnight moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure remained relatively stable until mid-morning, when it dipped slightly, then stabilized, reflecting a period of atmospheric adjustment likely tied to shifting air masses. Wind speeds intensified notably in the late afternoon and evening, with sustained higher velocities and a shift in wind direction toward the south and southeast, which may indicate the approach of a developing weather system. Combined, these trends suggest a dynamic atmospheric environment, potentially signaling the onset of a change in weather, possibly including increased cloud cover or precipitation, warranting close monitoring.
