Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a marked cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with significant nighttime temperature drops. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking near saturation, which contributed to a persistent fog or mist during the pre-dawn hours, reducing visibility and creating a damp, muggy feel. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the midday, peaking in the late afternoon before declining slightly, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system with potential for clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally low during the night and early morning, but increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and west, likely driven by evolving pressure gradients. The shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest during the day, coupled with elevated wind speeds and decreasing pressure, hints at the approach of a weather disturbance that may bring showers or thunderstorms later in the night.
