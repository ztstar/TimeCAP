Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant drop in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend into the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early morning hours, peaking at 100%, suggesting the presence of fog or dew formation and indicating a saturated air mass. A notable decrease in air pressure occurred during the overnight hours, particularly around the time of peak humidity, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may have brought unsettled conditions. Wind activity was minimal during most of the night but intensified in the late evening, with gusts from the northwest and west sectors, potentially associated with the passage of a frontal boundary. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and increasing wind speeds suggests a period of unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the likelihood of localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
