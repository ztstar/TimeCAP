Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the night, followed by a gradual warming trend through the morning and afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle influenced by nocturnal cooling and daytime solar heating. Humidity levels surged significantly in the early morning hours, peaking near dawn, which suggests the presence of fog or low clouds, consistent with the city’s coastal climate. A notable spike in air pressure occurred just before dawn, followed by a sharp drop, likely signaling the passage of a weather front, possibly associated with a change in wind patterns and the onset of unstable conditions. Wind speeds increased markedly in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the west and northwest, aligning with typical onshore flow patterns that can bring cooler marine air and enhance fog formation. These combined factors point to a dynamic transition period, where coastal influences and atmospheric instability may lead to variable and potentially unsettled weather in the coming hours.
