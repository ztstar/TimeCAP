Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming phase in the afternoon, indicating the influence of diurnal heating. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning and late night, suggesting nocturnal moisture accumulation, while a sharp decline occurred during midday, coinciding with rising temperatures and lower pressure. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the late afternoon, followed by a slight recovery, which may signal the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds remained generally light, except during early morning and late evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more northerly flow, potentially indicating changing synoptic conditions. These patterns suggest an approaching system with increasing instability, raising the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
