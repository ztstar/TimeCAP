Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon, indicating a transition from cooler to warmer conditions. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking before sharply declining in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend associated with changing air masses. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the day, culminating in a strong high-pressure system that likely brought stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night and early morning but intensified in the afternoon, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from northwest to southeast, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. These combined factors point to the arrival of a dry, stable high-pressure system, likely leading to improved weather conditions with clearer skies and warmer temperatures in the near term.
