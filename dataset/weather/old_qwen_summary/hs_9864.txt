Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable temperature rise in the afternoon, indicating a warming trend likely driven by increasing solar radiation and shifting air masses. Humidity levels remained elevated during the early morning and late evening, suggesting moisture accumulation, followed by a sharp drop in mid-afternoon, which may have coincided with a dry air intrusion. Air pressure showed a significant spike in the late afternoon, peaking near 1028 hPa, signaling the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially during the same period, with gusts from the southwest, indicating a shift in wind patterns that could be associated with the high-pressure buildup and potential for localized turbulence. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and strong winds from the southwest suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, though residual moisture may still pose a risk for isolated convective activity later in the day.
