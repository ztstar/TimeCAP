Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the late afternoon as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then showed a slight rise during the midday and early evening, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system. Wind speeds and directions indicate a shift from southerly to westerly and eventually northerly flow, with stronger gusts in the late afternoon and evening, likely driven by changing pressure gradients. These patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable nighttime environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, potentially signaling the approach of a drier air mass or a passing frontal boundary.
