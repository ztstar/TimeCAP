Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before a sharp decline during the late afternoon, suggesting the dissipation of fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure ridge that likely contributed to clearer skies and reduced wind activity. Wind speeds remained minimal during the night, with brief increases in the early morning and late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly, reflecting changes in local airflow patterns. These conditions collectively point to a transition from a moist, stable coastal environment to a drier, more stable regime, consistent with the clearing of marine layer conditions and improving visibility.
