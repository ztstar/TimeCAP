Over the past 24 hours, a steady cooling trend was observed, with temperatures declining through the night and early morning before stabilizing slightly in the afternoon. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning hours, peaking in the mid-morning before gradually decreasing, suggesting a potential shift in air mass. Air pressure increased steadily through the early and mid-day, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds picked up in the late morning and remained elevated through the afternoon, driven by a shift in wind direction toward the northeast, possibly signaling the approach of a frontal boundary. The combination of rising pressure, moderate to strong winds, and fluctuating humidity suggests a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, though minor changes in wind direction may indicate ongoing atmospheric adjustments.
