Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the night and early morning, indicating a period of high moisture content, which likely contributed to condensation and fog formation. Air pressure showed a significant rise during the overnight hours, suggesting the influence of a developing high-pressure system that stabilized conditions in the region. Wind speeds remained low overnight and increased steadily through the afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors point to a transition from a moist, stable night to a drier, more dynamic daytime atmosphere, potentially setting the stage for increased convective activity later in the day.
