A significant drop in air pressure occurred during the early hours, indicating the passage of a low-pressure system, likely associated with stormy conditions. Humidity levels surged dramatically, peaking near saturated levels, which contributed to a muggy atmosphere and increased potential for precipitation. Temperature remained relatively stable during the night but showed a noticeable rise in the late afternoon, suggesting the influence of warming air masses or clearing skies. Wind speeds increased notably during the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to southwest, consistent with a frontal passage. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic weather transition, with a high likelihood of rain or thunderstorms in the near term.
