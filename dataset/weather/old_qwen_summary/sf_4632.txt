Over the past 24 hours, a significant cooling trend was observed, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and reaching a minimum before gradually rising again. Humidity levels were consistently high during the early morning hours, indicating strong marine influence, followed by a sharp decline in the afternoon, suggesting a drying trend due to shifting wind patterns. Air pressure showed a notable drop in the early hours, followed by a recovery, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that likely brought the cooler, moist conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late evening and early morning, with strong, steady winds from the west and southwest, consistent with a coastal upwelling or onshore flow. The shift in wind direction toward the south and east in the late afternoon, combined with decreasing humidity and rising temperatures, points to a transition toward more stable, drier conditions typical of afternoon sea breeze patterns.
