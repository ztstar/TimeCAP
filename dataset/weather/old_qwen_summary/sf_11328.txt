Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced temperature drop during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a significant diurnal fluctuation likely driven by coastal fog and marine layer dynamics. Humidity levels remained stable during most of the day before surging in the early morning, coinciding with the temperature drop, which supports the presence of fog formation. Air pressure showed a steady increase, particularly during the early morning, suggesting the approach of a high-pressure system that may be stabilizing the atmosphere. Wind speeds diminished significantly during the same period, with near-zero readings at key intervals, aligning with a weakening of onshore flow and reduced mixing of air masses. The shift in wind direction—from prevailing southwesterly to calm or northerly—further underscores a temporary breakdown in the typical coastal wind pattern, potentially contributing to the fog and cooler conditions experienced overnight.
