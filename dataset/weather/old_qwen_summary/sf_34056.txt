Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle influenced by coastal dynamics. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before declining, which suggests the presence of marine fog or low cloud cover common in the region during this time of year. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase through the day, hinting at a stable high-pressure system contributing to the calm and clear conditions in the afternoon. Wind speeds were strongest during the night and early morning, with consistent easterly to northerly flow shifting toward westerly and southerly directions in the late afternoon, likely reflecting the influence of the Pacific high and local topography. These conditions collectively point to a typical coastal pattern with foggy, cool mornings and increasingly sunny, mild afternoons—common characteristics of San Francisco's microclimate.
