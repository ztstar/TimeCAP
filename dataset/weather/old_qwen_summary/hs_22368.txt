Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early hours before beginning to decline, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that likely contributed to the cooling effect. Air pressure exhibited a gradual decline, particularly in the late evening and early morning, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring further changes. Wind speeds increased significantly in the final hours, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, consistent with changing airflow patterns associated with the developing system. These conditions collectively suggest an increasing likelihood of precipitation and unstable weather in the near term.
