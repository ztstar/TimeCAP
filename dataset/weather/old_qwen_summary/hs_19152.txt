Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that likely contributed to reduced visibility and a heavy dew point. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a slight rise during midday and a decline toward the end of the period, hinting at a weakening high-pressure system or the approach of a frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light, with a brief increase in the late afternoon, and wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to more easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns around a weakening high. These conditions collectively suggest a transition period with lingering moisture and potential for isolated thunderstorms later in the day, especially if instability builds with continued warming.
