Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising steadily, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the night and early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before gradually declining, indicating moist air advection. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, suggesting the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the southeast to the south-southeast, aligning with typical synoptic patterns ahead of a developing storm system. These combined trends point to an increasing likelihood of thunderstorm activity later in the day or overnight, with potential for heavy rain and gusty winds.
