Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating a cooling trend likely driven by increased moisture and cloud cover. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at saturation point, which significantly contributed to a muggy and oppressive feel, especially during the night and early morning. Air pressure showed a gradual rise throughout the day, culminating in a high-pressure system that stabilized conditions and suppressed convective activity. Wind speeds diminished notably after midday, with winds shifting to a more variable and weak pattern, suggesting a weakening influence of regional wind systems. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a stagnant air mass, raising the potential for prolonged fog or low-lying cloud cover, particularly in the early morning hours.
