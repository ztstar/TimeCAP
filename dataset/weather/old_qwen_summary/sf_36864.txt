Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual recovery. A sharp rise in humidity during the early hours, peaking at saturation, coincided with a notable wind shift from northerly to westerly directions, suggesting the influence of marine air intrusion. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the late afternoon, indicating the arrival of a strong high-pressure system that likely stabilized conditions and brought clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified during the night, particularly from the west and southwest, which may have contributed to the cooling and increased turbulence. Combined, these patterns suggest a transition from foggy, damp conditions to drier, windier, and more stable weather as the high-pressure ridge consolidated over the region.
