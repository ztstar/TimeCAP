Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning to rise again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning, which likely contributed to a damp and foggy feel, particularly in the hours just before dawn. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring precipitation. Wind speeds surged dramatically in the early morning, with strong gusts from the south and southeast, consistent with the development of a frontal passage, while wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly, suggesting a change in atmospheric flow. These combined indicators suggest a significant weather shift, with the potential for rain or drizzle in the coming hours, particularly as the system continues to influence the region.
