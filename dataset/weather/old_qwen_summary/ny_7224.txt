Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a significant warming phase in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a shifting air mass. Humidity levels remained elevated through the night and early morning, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to fog or mist formation, before dropping sharply during the afternoon as temperatures rose. A notable pressure increase occurred in the late afternoon, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that may bring clearer skies and stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate during the night and early morning, but increased in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeast to northwest, signaling a change in airflow patterns. These combined factors suggest a transition from a damp, cool, and stable environment to a drier, warmer, and more dynamic air mass, potentially leading to improving weather conditions in the coming hours.
