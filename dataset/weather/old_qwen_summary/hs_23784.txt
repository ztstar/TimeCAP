Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature during the overnight hours, followed by a gradual warming trend into the afternoon, indicating the influence of nighttime radiational cooling and subsequent solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early morning, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before steadily decreasing, suggesting the presence of a nocturnal moisture buildup likely tied to atmospheric stability. Air pressure showed a consistent rise through the night and early morning, reaching a peak mid-morning before a slight drop in the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a changing air mass. Wind patterns shifted from a steady southerly to a more northerly direction by late afternoon, with increasing wind speeds, potentially indicating the onset of a frontal passage. These combined trends suggest a transition period in Houston’s weather, possibly setting the stage for unstable conditions, including the potential for afternoon thunderstorms.
