Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady decline in temperature through the night, followed by a gradual warming trend during the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from cooler nighttime conditions to a more moderate daytime pattern. Humidity levels rose significantly after midnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting increased moisture availability in the lower atmosphere, which may elevate the risk of fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through and consistent high-pressure influence. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable shift in wind direction from west to southeast in the early morning, aligning with a possible onshore flow that could contribute to moisture transport. Together, these trends suggest a stable but increasingly humid environment, potentially setting the stage for afternoon convective activity if daytime heating intensifies.
