Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon, indicating a diurnal cycle influenced by solar heating. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist, stable conditions to drier, more comfortable air. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night and early morning, then declined steadily into the late afternoon, which may signal the approach of a weakening weather system or a low-pressure influence. Wind speeds were light and variable during the night and early morning, increasing notably in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly, potentially indicating an onshore flow. These combined patterns suggest a transition from a humid, stable night to a drier, breezier afternoon, with possible implications for localized convective activity later in the day.
