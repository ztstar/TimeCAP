Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a consistent decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual rise into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels increased significantly during the overnight hours, peaking in the early morning before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the passage of a moist air mass and subsequent drying. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before stabilizing, which is often associated with approaching or passing frontal systems. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable increase from the southwest, and wind direction shifted progressively from the south to the west and northwest, consistent with a changing synoptic-scale flow. These combined indicators suggest the influence of a developing low-pressure system, potentially bringing unsettled weather, including possible precipitation, to the region in the near future.
