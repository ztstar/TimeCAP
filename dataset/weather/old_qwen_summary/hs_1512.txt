Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply through the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moist, stable air mass that began to dissipate as temperatures increased. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, particularly during the afternoon, which may indicate the approach of a low-pressure system or an incoming weather front. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the south and southeast, potentially signaling the influence of a developing convective system or frontal boundary. These combined trends point to an evolving weather pattern with increasing instability, raising the likelihood of afternoon or evening thunderstorms later in the day.
