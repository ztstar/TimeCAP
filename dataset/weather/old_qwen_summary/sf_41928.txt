Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high, particularly during the night and early morning, indicating prolonged fog formation and low visibility, typical of coastal marine influence. Air pressure exhibited fluctuating patterns, with notable drops during the night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in coastal air masses. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts originating from the southwest, likely enhancing onshore flow and contributing to the persistence of fog and cool conditions. These combined factors point to a classic coastal marine weather pattern, with a strong likelihood of continued fog and cool temperatures into the early morning hours.
