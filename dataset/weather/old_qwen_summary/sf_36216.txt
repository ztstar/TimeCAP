Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping steadily through the night and early morning before rebounding slightly in the late afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically in the early hours, peaking in the late evening and early morning, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s coastal climate. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the night, stabilizing at a slightly lower level in the early morning, suggesting the approach of a weak low-pressure system or a shift in maritime influence. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southwesterly to southeasterly, consistent with a coastal breeze pattern enhanced by temperature gradients. These conditions together point to a typical marine layer event, bringing cool, moist air and potentially reducing visibility, especially during the early morning hours.
