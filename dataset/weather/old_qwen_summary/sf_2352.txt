Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity levels rose sharply during the early hours, peaking in the early morning and remaining elevated through midday, indicating a strong presence of moisture in the lower atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, culminating in a peak before declining slightly in the late evening, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally light, with periods of calm interrupted by brief bursts, particularly in the evening, while wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to more southerly and then easterly, reflecting changing flow patterns near the coast. These conditions point to a marine layer developing and dissipating, typical of San Francisco’s coastal climate, with the potential for foggy mornings and clearer afternoons as high pressure consolidates.
