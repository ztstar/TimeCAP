Over the past 24 hours, a significant temperature rise occurred, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening, indicating the onset of a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, suggesting a period of saturated air, followed by a sharp decline, which coincides with the temperature increase and may signal clearing skies. Air pressure steadily decreased through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to recover, consistent with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, with stronger gusts from the southwest and west, likely associated with the intensifying low-pressure system. The shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then northerly suggests the influence of a developing frontal boundary, which could bring changing conditions, including possible precipitation, in the near future.
