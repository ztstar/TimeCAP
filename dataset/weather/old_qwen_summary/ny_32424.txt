Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a transition from a cooler to a milder thermal regime. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours before sharply declining during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass that likely accompanied the warming trend. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a consistent high-pressure system in place, contributing to generally fair and settled conditions. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and decreased during the late afternoon and evening, with wind direction shifting from northwest to more west-southwest, indicating a change in circulation pattern. These combined factors suggest a period of stable, dry, and gradually warming weather, with minimal risk of precipitation or storm activity.
