Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating the influence of diurnal temperature cycles. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours, suggesting overnight condensation and potential fog formation, which may have reduced visibility. Air pressure remained stable through the night before a slight decline in the late evening, hinting at the possible approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a consistent southerly to southwesterly flow throughout most of the period, which may have contributed to moisture advection and humid conditions. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to a stagnant air mass, increasing the likelihood of discomfort and potential for localized showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
