Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early morning, persisting at 100% for several hours, indicating a high likelihood of fog or light precipitation. A significant drop in air pressure occurred in the late night and early morning, suggesting the passage of a low-pressure system associated with unstable conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with brief increases later in the day, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more easterly, aligning with the movement of the low-pressure system. These combined factors point to a transition period marked by damp, cool conditions and potential for lingering drizzle or fog, particularly in low-lying areas.
