Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking at near-saturation conditions, which likely contributed to a pronounced dew point and a muggy feel during the early hours. Air pressure exhibited a consistent decline through the night, reaching a minimum before stabilizing, suggesting a weakening low-pressure system passing through the region. Wind speeds increased significantly in the late afternoon and evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a strong northerly flow, indicating a change in atmospheric circulation. The combination of high humidity, rising wind speeds, and shifting wind direction may signal the approach of a frontal boundary, potentially leading to unstable conditions and an increased chance of thunderstorms later in the day.
