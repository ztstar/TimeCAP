Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a significant drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a pronounced nocturnal cooling phase. Humidity levels surged to near saturation during the night and early morning, particularly between midnight and dawn, suggesting strong fog formation or low cloud cover consistent with the region’s marine layer. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and into the afternoon, peaking sharply before declining slightly, which may signal the passage of a high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds remained moderate to strong during the early hours, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to a more variable pattern, indicating dynamic atmospheric adjustments. These trends point to the dissipation of a persistent marine layer, with clearing skies and improving conditions expected in the coming hours.
