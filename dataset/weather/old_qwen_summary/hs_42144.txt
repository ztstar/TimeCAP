Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a pronounced temperature inversion in the early hours. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking during the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of moist air mass that began to dissipate as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced storm activity. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a consistent flow from the south and southwest during the night and early morning, shifting to more variable directions in the afternoon, which may have aided in the dispersion of moisture. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and stable pressure suggests improving weather conditions, with a lower likelihood of precipitation and increased comfort levels later in the day.
