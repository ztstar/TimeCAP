Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming toward the late afternoon. High humidity levels persisted through the night and early morning, reaching saturation and likely contributing to dense fog that blanketed the city. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through, consistent with a persistent marine layer. Wind speeds were low during the night and early morning, increasing steadily in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from the west-southwest to the south-southeast, suggesting a change in airflow patterns. These conditions point to a strong coastal influence, with the prevailing marine layer maintaining cool, foggy conditions overnight and a gradual clearing likely as winds strengthen and temperatures rise.
