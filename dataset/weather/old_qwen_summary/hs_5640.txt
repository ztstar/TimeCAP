Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked during the overnight period, remaining near saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of mist or fog and increased discomfort during cooler hours. Air pressure steadily increased through the night and into the morning, indicating the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system that has stabilized the atmosphere. Wind speeds were generally moderate, with a notable surge in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to more easterly, suggesting changing flow patterns near the surface. These conditions point to a transition toward clearer skies and more settled weather, though lingering moisture may still support isolated afternoon showers.
