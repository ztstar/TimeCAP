Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures dropping during the night and early morning before stabilizing in the mid-range. Humidity levels rose significantly during the early hours, peaking in the morning and remaining elevated, indicating increased moisture in the atmosphere. Air pressure showed a steady increase through the night, culminating in a slight rise before beginning to decline, which may signal a weakening high-pressure system. Wind activity was variable, with strong gusts in the early evening followed by prolonged calm periods, especially during the early morning hours. The shift in wind direction, particularly from northerly to easterly and southerly, suggests changing airflow patterns consistent with a developing low-pressure influence, potentially setting the stage for unstable or stormy conditions later in the day.
