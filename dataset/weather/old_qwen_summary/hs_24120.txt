Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a pronounced temperature decline during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels peaked sharply in the early morning, remaining near saturation during the night before dropping significantly as temperatures rose, indicating potential drying conditions. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period, with a notable increase during the midday hours, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that may have contributed to clearer skies. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, particularly from the southwest and south, with gusts reaching notable strength, which could signal the approach of a dynamic weather front. The shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to more westerly and northerly later in the period may indicate a change in air mass, potentially bringing cooler and drier conditions in the coming hours.
