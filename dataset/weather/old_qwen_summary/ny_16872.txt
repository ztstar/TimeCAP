Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming trend through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early hours, which suggests the presence of moist air and potential for fog or low clouds. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system, which may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to more easterly, consistent with a frontal passage. These combined patterns suggest the city experienced a transition through a frontal boundary, likely bringing overcast skies and a higher chance of precipitation in the near term.
