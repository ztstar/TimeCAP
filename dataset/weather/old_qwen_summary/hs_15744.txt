Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a pronounced warming in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle typical of the region’s humid subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the pre-dawn hours before dropping sharply during the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a daytime boundary layer drying process. Air pressure remained stable through most of the period, with a slight increase during midday and a gradual decline toward the end, hinting at a possible weakening high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly in the afternoon, indicating a change in local flow patterns that may be associated with a developing sea breeze. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind direction points to the onset of a more stable, drier, and potentially hotter daytime regime, which could contribute to increased heat stress and reduced precipitation likelihood in the near term.
