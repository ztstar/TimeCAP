Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant temperature drop, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, suggesting a strong cooling trend likely driven by a shifting air mass. Humidity levels remained consistently high, peaking at near saturation, which indicates stable moisture conditions and a high likelihood of fog or dew formation during the cooler hours. Air pressure steadily increased, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during most of the day, but a notable increase occurred in the early morning hours, coinciding with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, which may reflect a boundary interaction or frontal passage. These combined trends suggest a transition from humid, stable conditions to potentially drier and more stable weather in the coming hours.
