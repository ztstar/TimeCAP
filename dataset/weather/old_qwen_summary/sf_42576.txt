Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained consistently high during the overnight hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature stabilization. A shift in wind patterns, particularly a change in direction from northwest to more southerly and easterly sectors, suggests an evolving synoptic setup, possibly linked to a weakening marine layer. Wind speeds increased significantly in the early morning before tapering off, with the strongest gusts originating from the southwest, consistent with coastal upwelling dynamics. The drop in air pressure toward the end of the period hints at the approach of a low-pressure system, which could bring additional moisture and unsettled conditions in the coming hours.
