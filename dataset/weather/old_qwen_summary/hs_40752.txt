Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady rise in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to decline, indicating a strong daytime heating cycle. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase during the early morning hours followed by a sharp drop in the afternoon, suggesting the influence of a drying air mass. Air pressure showed minor variations, with a slight upward trend in the late afternoon, possibly signaling the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction toward the southwest and south, consistent with a developing sea breeze or frontal influence. These conditions collectively point to a transition toward more stable, drier air, which could lead to clearer skies and reduced chances of thunderstorms in the near term.
