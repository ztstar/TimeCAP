Over the past 24 hours, temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low around dawn before gradually rising into the afternoon, indicating a clear diurnal cycle typical of a cold front’s influence. Humidity levels climbed significantly during the early morning hours, peaking at saturation just before sunrise, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night but began a gradual decline in the afternoon, signaling the arrival of a low-pressure system that may bring changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon and evening, accompanied by shifts in wind direction from northwesterly to southerly, consistent with the approach of an advancing weather front. These combined trends point toward a transition in the weather pattern, with possible precipitation or storm development likely in the near term.
