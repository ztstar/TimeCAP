Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping sharply in the late afternoon, suggesting a transition from moist marine air to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase during the midday and early evening, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system influencing the region. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable calm period in the early morning and a resurgence in the late afternoon, accompanied by shifting wind directions that suggest changing airflow patterns. These conditions point to a typical coastal diurnal cycle, with potential for fog dissipation in the afternoon and clearer skies emerging as the high-pressure system consolidates.
