Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a pronounced warming period in the afternoon and evening, indicating a strong diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping significantly during the afternoon, which suggests a transition from a moist, stable air mass to drier, more unstable conditions. Air pressure showed a notable increase in the mid-afternoon, likely associated with the passage of a high-pressure system that brought clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, possibly signaling the influence of a developing boundary or frontal feature. These combined trends point to a dynamic shift in atmospheric conditions, with implications for potential afternoon thunderstorms and changing air quality as the day progresses.
