Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels dropped significantly after midnight, reaching a low in the late morning before beginning to rise again, suggesting the influence of daytime heating and possible moisture influx. Air pressure showed a notable increase during the early morning hours, peaking before stabilizing, which may signal the approach or passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds intensified in the late morning and afternoon, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, pointing to changing circulation patterns. These combined trends suggest a transition toward drier, more stable conditions, potentially reducing the risk of thunderstorms but increasing heat retention during the day.
