Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels rose steadily throughout the day, peaking in the final hours, which suggests increasing moisture content in the atmosphere and a higher likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a significant drop during midday, followed by a sharp rise in the evening, signaling the passage of a weather system and potentially the arrival of clearer conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the afternoon and evening, accompanied by a consistent shift in wind direction from the west-southwest toward the west-northwest, indicating a change in atmospheric flow. These combined trends point to a dynamic weather transition, with the potential for developing showers or thunderstorms later in the evening or overnight.
