Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline through the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicating a cooling trend during the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night, dropping significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, suggesting a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure exhibited a downward trend, particularly in the early hours, followed by a stabilization, which may signal the passage of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, with a notable increase in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and eventually northwesterly, indicating a change in airflow patterns. Together, these trends suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, potentially more unsettled condition, possibly setting the stage for changing weather later in the day.
