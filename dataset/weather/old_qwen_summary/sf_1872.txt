Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the night and early morning before beginning a gradual recovery. Humidity levels showed a notable decline during the early morning hours, remaining low through midday, which suggests dry air infiltration, potentially increasing fire risk. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified in the late afternoon and evening, with gusts reaching strong levels, driven by shifting wind directions from the west to the northwest, likely due to pressure gradient changes. The combination of dry air, increasing pressure, and strong winds suggests a period of elevated fire weather potential, particularly in exposed or vegetated areas.
