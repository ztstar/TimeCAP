Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining sharply as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from condensation to evaporation. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of an approaching high-pressure system that likely contributed to the clearing skies and reduced cloud cover. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with a shift in direction from the southeast to the west-southwest, consistent with changing pressure gradients and possible influence from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions point to a stable, drying trend developing, which may reduce the likelihood of precipitation in the near term despite the earlier high moisture content.
