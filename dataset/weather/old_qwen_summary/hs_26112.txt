Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly during the night, peaking in the early morning hours before sharply declining as temperatures increased, indicating a transition from stable, saturated conditions to drier air. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the morning and early afternoon, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which likely contributed to clearer skies and improved conditions. Wind patterns shifted from southerly to westerly and then to more variable directions, with a noticeable increase in speed during the late afternoon and evening, potentially signaling the onset of a diurnal circulation change. These dynamics point to a transition from a humid, stable nocturnal environment to a drier, more dynamic daytime regime, which could support the development of isolated convective activity later in the day.
