Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating a significant nocturnal cooling phase likely influenced by clear skies and reduced cloud cover. Humidity levels showed a striking pattern, peaking dramatically in the early hours before plummeting to very low values during midday, suggesting a transition from foggy, moist conditions to dry, sunny weather. Air pressure fluctuated notably, with a sharp rise in the late night and early morning, coinciding with the lowest temperatures and highest humidity—consistent with a passing high-pressure system bringing clearing skies. Wind speeds increased significantly during the overnight period, with strong southerly to westerly gusts, which likely contributed to the cooling and helped disperse moisture, followed by a marked decrease in wind activity during the afternoon. The shift in wind direction from the southwest to the east-southeast and then back to the south in the late afternoon suggests a dynamic reorganization of airflow, possibly due to coastal influences and the development of a thermal low, which may foreshadow changing conditions later in the day.
