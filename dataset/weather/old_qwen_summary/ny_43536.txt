Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady rise, indicating a warming trend throughout the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. Humidity levels dropped significantly in the latter half of the period, suggesting drier air masses moving in, which may reduce the chance of precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing no strong indication of an approaching storm system, though a slight decline earlier in the day could hint at shifting atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds increased notably during the late evening and early morning, with a sharp spike in the early hours, likely driven by a change in wind direction from northerly to westerly, potentially bringing cooler air. The shift in wind direction toward the west and northwest may signal the influence of a developing high-pressure system, contributing to clearer skies and improving conditions in the coming hours.
