Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady decline in temperature, reaching a low during the early morning hours before gradually warming through the afternoon. Humidity remained near saturation overnight, indicating a high likelihood of fog or drizzle, which was consistent with the rapid drop in temperature. Air pressure rose steadily through the night and early morning, peaking in the mid-morning before declining, suggesting the passage of a high-pressure system followed by an approaching low-pressure front. Wind patterns shifted significantly, beginning from the northwest, transitioning to the south and east by midday, with increasing speeds in the late afternoon, indicating a change in air mass. These conditions point to a developing weather front, with potential for precipitation and cooler conditions later in the day.
