Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a steady cooling trend during the night and early morning, followed by a gradual warming through the afternoon, reflecting typical diurnal temperature patterns. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning hours, indicating the presence of fog or low-level moisture, which likely contributed to the cooler temperatures. A significant rise in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that brought drier and more stable conditions later in the day. Wind speeds increased notably in the late afternoon, particularly from a southerly to easterly direction, potentially signaling a shift in airflow that could affect coastal fog dynamics. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and changing wind patterns suggests a transition toward clearer skies and more favorable conditions for outdoor activities in the coming hours.
