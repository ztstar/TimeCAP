Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual cooling trend, with temperatures peaking in the early morning and declining through the night before beginning to rise again. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early hours, reaching near saturation before dropping significantly during midday, followed by a resurgence in the late evening. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, indicating the approach and passage of a high-pressure system that likely contributed to stable and clearing conditions. Wind speeds were generally low during the early morning and remained weak until midday, when they intensified, particularly in the late evening, suggesting the development of localized convection or frontal influences. The shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and southerly sectors reflects changing air mass dynamics, potentially signaling a transition in weather patterns that could influence afternoon thunderstorm potential.
