Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming period into the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose significantly through the night, peaking in the early morning before gradually declining, indicating a shift from moist, stable conditions to drier air as the day progressed. Air pressure increased steadily after midnight, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving in, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather. Wind speeds picked up in the late evening and remained elevated into the night, with a shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly, potentially signaling a change in air mass. Taken together, these indicators suggest a transition from a humid, relatively calm night toward a warmer, drier, and more stable day, with decreasing chances of precipitation.
