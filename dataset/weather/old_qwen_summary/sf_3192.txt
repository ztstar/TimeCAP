Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable cooling trend during the night, with temperatures dropping significantly before gradually rising again in the late morning and afternoon. Humidity levels surged dramatically during the early morning hours, peaking just before dawn, indicating the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which is typical of the region’s coastal microclimate. A marked increase in air pressure occurred around midday, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that likely brought clearer skies and more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a shift from stronger, more consistent winds in the early night to near-still conditions in the late afternoon and early evening, possibly due to the influence of the high-pressure ridge. The combination of rising pressure, decreasing wind, and warming temperatures points to a transition toward drier, more stable weather, typical of a clearing and warming pattern following a foggy or overcast period.
