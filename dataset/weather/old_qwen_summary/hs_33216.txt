Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming in the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels rose steadily through the night, peaking in the early morning before dropping slightly in the afternoon, indicating a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, suggesting the influence of a strengthening high-pressure system, which typically brings stable and clear conditions. Wind speeds remained low during the night and early morning, with a significant increase in the afternoon, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northwesterly, potentially signaling the approach of a front. These patterns suggest a transition from a moist, stable environment to a drier, more dynamic air mass, which could lead to improving conditions and clearer skies later in the day.
