Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a steady decline during the night, reaching a minimum before gradually rising through the morning and into the afternoon. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning hours before dropping during midday, indicating a shift in atmospheric moisture content. Air pressure remained relatively stable through the night, with a notable increase in the early morning followed by a slight drop, suggesting the passage of a weak high-pressure system. Wind speeds were moderate overnight and during the morning, with a brief spike in the late afternoon, while wind direction shifted from northwest to southerly, indicating a change in air mass flow. These trends collectively suggest a transition from a cold, dry, and stable nighttime air mass to a warmer, moister, and more dynamic afternoon regime, potentially increasing the likelihood of scattered showers later in the day.
