Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a steady warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating a diurnal cycle typical of the region’s subtropical climate. Humidity levels rose significantly overnight, peaking in the early morning before declining during the day, suggesting the presence of a moist air mass that began to dissipate as temperatures increased. Air pressure showed a gradual increase through the night and early morning, reaching a peak in the midday hours before a slight drop in the evening, which may reflect the passage of a weak high-pressure system followed by a potential influence from a developing low-pressure area. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the period, with a shift in wind direction from southeasterly to southwesterly, indicating a change in airflow that could signal the approach of a weather front. These combined trends suggest a transition phase in Houston’s weather, with potential for increasing instability and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms later in the day.
