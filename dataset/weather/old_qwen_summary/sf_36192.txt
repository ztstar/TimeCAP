Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable nighttime cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually rising in the late afternoon. Humidity levels increased substantially overnight, peaking in the early morning, which suggests the potential for fog formation, a common occurrence in the region during cooler periods. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the night and early morning, indicating the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained low during most of the night, but a sharp increase occurred in the final hour, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the west to the southwest, suggesting a change in atmospheric conditions. These trends collectively point to a transition in the local weather pattern, possibly heralding the arrival of marine layer influence or a shift in wind flow that could affect visibility and coastal temperatures.
