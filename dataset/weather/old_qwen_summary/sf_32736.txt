Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the early morning hours before gradually warming again in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, peaking during the night and early morning, suggesting the presence of fog or low cloud cover, which likely contributed to the temperature inversion. A notable spike in wind speed occurred in the early morning, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from the southwest to the southeast, indicating a possible change in atmospheric circulation. Air pressure showed a brief but sharp rise during the mid-morning, followed by a gradual decline, hinting at the passage of a weather front or pressure system. These combined indicators suggest a dynamic coastal weather pattern, with marine influence playing a key role, potentially leading to continued fog and cool conditions in the coming hours.
