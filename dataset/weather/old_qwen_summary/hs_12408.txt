Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a steady drop in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual rise in the afternoon, indicating a strong overnight cooling trend likely due to clear skies and radiational cooling. Humidity levels remained high during the night and early morning, then declined significantly through the day, suggesting a drying trend associated with a shift in air mass. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, peaking in the late afternoon, which is characteristic of a building high-pressure system bringing stable, dry conditions. Wind speeds varied with a notable surge in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from northwest to north and then to northeast, signaling a change in circulation patterns possibly linked to a cold front. These combined indicators suggest the approach of a drier, cooler air mass, potentially leading to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions in the coming hours.
