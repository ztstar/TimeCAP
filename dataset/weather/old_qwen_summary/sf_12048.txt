Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming through the day, indicating a significant diurnal temperature cycle likely driven by fog dissipation and increasing solar insolation. Humidity levels rose sharply overnight, peaking in the early morning, which is typical of coastal fog formation, before dropping steadily as the sun rose and air warmed. A notable drop in air pressure occurred mid-morning, suggesting the passage of a weather front, which may have contributed to the fog and changing wind patterns. Wind speeds increased during the night and early morning, shifting from southerly to westerly and then to more variable directions, consistent with the influence of local topography and coastal dynamics. The combination of cooling, high humidity, and falling pressure early on, followed by clearing skies and decreasing wind speeds later, points to a transition from foggy, coastal conditions to a drier, more stable environment in the afternoon.
