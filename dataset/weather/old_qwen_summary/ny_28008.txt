Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in New York City showed a sustained period of cool conditions during the early morning hours, followed by a noticeable warming trend in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, peaking in the early hours before gradually declining during the day, indicating possible moisture accumulation and subsequent dispersion. Air pressure exhibited a stable baseline with a slight rise in the late afternoon and evening, suggesting a developing high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds increased notably in the late evening, accompanied by a shift in wind direction from southerly to easterly and then northeasterly, signaling a change in airflow patterns likely tied to the approaching high pressure. These trends collectively suggest a transition toward drier, more stable weather conditions, with the potential for improved visibility and mild temperatures in the coming hours.
