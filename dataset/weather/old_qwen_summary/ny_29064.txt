Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a steady cooling trend during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming into the afternoon and evening, indicating the arrival of a warmer air mass. Humidity levels climbed significantly overnight and remained elevated through mid-morning, suggesting moisture accumulation, likely contributing to fog or low cloud cover. Air pressure steadily declined through the night and early morning, reaching a low point before beginning to rise slightly, signaling the passage of a low-pressure system that may have brought precipitation. Wind speeds increased notably during the late night and early morning, with a shift to stronger southerly and southeasterly winds, which likely facilitated the influx of warm, moist air. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, and weakening pressure suggests a transition toward muggy, potentially unstable conditions, increasing the risk of scattered showers or thunderstorms later in the day.
