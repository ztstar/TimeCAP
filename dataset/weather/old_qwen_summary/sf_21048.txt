Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a prolonged period of near-saturated humidity, particularly during the early morning hours, indicating strong moisture presence and potential for fog formation. Temperatures steadily declined through the night, reaching a low point before gradually increasing in the afternoon, suggesting a cooling trend followed by a warming phase likely due to shifting air masses. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, especially in the latter half of the period, signaling the approach of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds increased significantly in the final hours, with stronger gusts from the northwest, consistent with a developing onshore flow that could enhance coastal fog and cool temperatures. The combination of high humidity, falling pressure, and strengthening winds points to an active marine layer and potential for persistent fog or drizzle in the coming hours.
