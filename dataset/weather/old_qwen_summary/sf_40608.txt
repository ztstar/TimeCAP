Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a pronounced cooling trend, with temperatures dropping significantly during the overnight hours before beginning a gradual recovery in the late morning. Humidity levels rose sharply in the early evening, peaking at saturation, which likely contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds, consistent with the region’s coastal climate patterns. A notable increase in air pressure occurred during the late night and early morning, indicating the passage of a high-pressure system that brought stable, clear conditions. Wind speeds intensified during the late morning and early afternoon, with gusts from the southeast and east, suggesting a breakdown in the usual marine layer and the influence of a shifting pressure gradient. The combination of falling temperatures, high humidity, and variable wind patterns points to a transition from foggy, cool coastal conditions toward a more variable and potentially breezy afternoon, with implications for visibility and outdoor comfort.
