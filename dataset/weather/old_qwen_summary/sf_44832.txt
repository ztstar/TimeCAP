Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable atmospheric conditions, with no significant fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistent wind direction from the southeast suggests a persistent maritime influence, likely due to a stable high-pressure system offshore. The unchanging humidity levels indicate dry air, which may contribute to a lack of cloud formation and increased solar radiation during daylight hours. With steady wind speeds and negligible changes in pressure, there is little indication of developing weather systems or storm activity. Overall, the weather remains calm and predictable, favoring clear skies and comfortable conditions, though the dry air may increase wildfire risk in surrounding areas.
